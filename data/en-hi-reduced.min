Address of the Arbitration Centres
Gold is the oldest precious metal known to man and for thousands of years it has been valued as a global currency , a commodity , an investment and simply an object of beauty . 
Gold ( Chemical Symbol - Au ) is primarily a monetary asset and partly a commodity . 
Global Scenario
Indian Scenario
India , world’s largest market for gold , 
Factors Influencing the Market
Platinum is the rarest of all precious metals . 
It has several unique chemical and physical properties that make it essential in a wide range of industrial and environmental applications . 
Platinum is also considered as one of the finest of all jewellery metals . 
Major Characteristics
Platinum as a pure metal is silvery - white in appearance , lustrous , ductile , and malleable . 
It is widely used in several industrial applications as it possesses high resistance to chemical attack , excellent high - temperature characteristics , and stable electrical properties . 
Platinum is corrosion resistant and is more precious than gold . 
Platinum ' s wear - and tarnish - resistance characteristics are well suited for making fine jewelry . 
Platinum is traded as a commodity with prices determined by market forces . 
It is also a widely sought after investment avenue in recent years . 
However , it is not widely treated as a monetary base like gold . 
Global Supply Demand Scenario
The supply of platinum is met by mine production , auto catalyst refining and jewellery refining with their respective contribution estimated to be 6 . 15 million ounces , 1 million ounce and 0 . 9 million ounce in 2008 . 
The annual production of platinum has averaged around 6 . 2 million ounces ( 193 tonnes ) in the previous three years from 2006 with more than 90 % of the production coming from South Africa ( 76 % ) and Russia . 
The other producers are United States of America , Canada and Zimbabwe . 
The production of platinum is highly dependent on South Africa ' s production with 2009 output from South Africa , Russia , USA and Zimbabwe estimated to be 4 . 7 million ouces , 0 . 74 , 0 . 25 and 0 . 33 million ounces respectively . 
The platinum mining industry is very capital intensive and it is reported that approximately 10 tonnes of raw ore has to be mined to produce just one pure ounce of platinum . 
Unlike other precious metals like gold and silver , there are no large above - ground platinum stockpiles to protect against significant supply disruptions . 
Some estimates predict that existing above ground reserves would last only for a year , if platinum mining was suddenly stopped . 
The demand for platinum mainly comes from auto catalyst , jewellery , other industrial application and investment . 
The other industries uses platinum are electronics , glass and petroleum industry . 
The total global demand for this rare metal is reported to be around 7 . 79 million ounces in 2008 , with consumption by auto catalyst ( used in automobiles ) , jewellery , investment and other industrial applications estimated to be around 3 . 8 , 1 . 6 , 0 . 45 and 1 . 9 million ounces respectively . 
North America , Europe , China and Japan are the most important economies accounting for majority of the global platinum consumption .

Indian Platinum Market
India ' s appetite for platinum has been steadily increasing in recent years on account of the country ' s economic progress leading to rising industrial demand and increasing preference for platinum jewellery in urban areas . 
India ' s consumption of platinum in 2008 - 09 is estimated to be around 932 kgs , which is expected to rise to around 1200 kgs in 2009 - 10 . 
The approximate consumption by various sectors in India is estimated to be automobile ( 55 % ) , petrochemicals ( 25 % ) , jewellery ( 15 % ) and electronics & dental ( 5 % ) . 
Market Moving Factors
Indian platinum prices are highly correlated with international prices . 
However , the fluctuations in the INR - US Dollar impact domestic platinum prices and have to be closely followed . 
The global prices are driven by a host of factors with macro - economic factors like strength of the global economy , currency movements , interest rates , rising importance of emerging markets being major influencing factors . 
Economic situation in major consuming countries like USA , Europe , Japan and China influence consumption on account to its high demand from industrial sectors , especially automobiles . 
Platinum production is highly skewed with just four mines and two countries producing almost 90 % of the total annual production . 
Prices are influenced profoundly by production disruptions , policies taken in producing countries . 
The influence of this factor is enhanced by the absence of any significant global stocks of platinum in the world , unlike that of gold and silver . 
Additionally , platinum mining is a very capital intensive industry , which discourages entry of new players . 
Any change in global stocks , of which a major portion is present in Russia do influence prices . 
The price movement in other precious metals , especially gold is a major influencing factor . 
Aluminium is the third most abundant element present in the earth ' s crust . 
It exists in a very stable combination with other materials particularly silicates and oxides . 
Lead is very corrosion - resistant , ductile , and malleable blue - grey metal that has been in use for at least 5 , 000 years . 
Steel is an alloy consisting mostly of iron , with varying amounts of other elements like carbon , manganese , chromium , silicon , oxygen etc . 
Different grades of steel are produced by adjusting the chemical composition and by slight variations in the different stages of steel - making process . 
Currently , there are more than 3000 catalogued grades of steel available . 
Steel is one of the most common materials in the world and is a major component in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , automobiles , machines , and appliances . 
It is environment friendly , can be recycled and requires considerably less energy to produce than some other metals . 
Steel market is primarily divided into two categories - flat and long . 
Flat Steel : Plate or a ( hot or cold ) rolled strip product . Typical products are plates , HR coils , HR sheets , CR coils , CR sheets , Galvanised plates ( GP ) , Galvanised coils ( GC ) , pipes etc
Long Steel : Rod or a bar . Typical rod products are the reinforcing rods made from sponge iron for concrete , ingots , billets , engineering products , gears tools etc . 
Global steel production grew enormously in the 20th century from a mere 28 million tonnes at the beginning of the century to 781 million tonnes at the end . 
Further progress has been seen in the first decade of the 21st century . 
The global crude steel production in 2008 is reported to be 1 , 330 million tonnes . 
Steel consumption of a country increases when its economy is growing , as its government invests in infrastructure and transport , and the nation sees building of new factories and houses . 
Construction industry accounts for around 50 % of the global steel consumption . 
Cars , which accounts for 13 % of the global steel consumption is the second largest consuming sector . 
The main producing and consuming regions of steel have shifted from the developed world to the developing regions with Asia accounting for more than 55 % of the global steel production . 
The five largest producers of crude in 2008 are China ( 500 million tonnes ) , Japan ( 199 million tonnes ) , US ( 91 million tonnes ) , Russia ( 68 million tonnes ) and India ( 55 million tonnes ) 
Global steel - making capacity has outstripped consumption in recent years . 
The world - wide apparent steel use in 2008 is estimated to be around 1197 million tonnes , which is down by 1 . 4 % from the 2007 figures . 
The largest consumers in 2008 are China ( 425 . 7 million tonnes ) , US ( 97 . 5 ) , Japan ( 76 . 4 ) , South Korea ( 58 . 6 ) and India ( 52 . 6 million tonnes ) 
Steel is one of the most recycled materials , basically because it is economical to do so and does not result in any loss of properties . 
It is estimated that currently over a third of global steel comes from recycled material . 
However , recycling rates vary a lot between countries with Spain and Turkey producing nearly 90 % of their steel from recycled material in 2008 , followed by Italy ( 77 % ) , the United States ( 64 % ) , South Korea ( 52 % ) , Russia / Ukraine ( 48 % ) and Germany ( 45 % ) . 
The share of recycling - based production is estimated to be considerably lower in China , India and Brazil . 
The Indian steel industry has entered into a new development phase from 2005 - 06 , riding high on a resurgent economy and rising demand for steel . 
The sharp rise in production has lead to India becoming the fifth largest producer of steel in the world , with a 2008 crude steel production of above 55 million tonnes . 
The growth phase in India ' s steel industry is expected to pick pace further . 
India ' s steel consumption is projected to increase annually by above 10 % till 2012 , fuelled by demand for construction projects . 
The scope for raising the total consumption of steel in India is huge , given that per capita steel consumption is only 40 kg - compared to 150 kg across the world and 250 kg in China . 
The National Steel Policy has envisaged steel production to reach 110 million tonnes by 2019 - 20 . 
However , Ministry of Steel has projected that the steel capacity in the county is likely to be 124 . 06 million tonnes by 2011 - 12 itself . 
Iron and steel are freely exportable and importable as per current government guidelines . 
India is estimated to have exported 4 . 6 million tonnes and imported 6 . 6 million tonnes of carbon steel in 2007 - 08 . 
Indian steel prices are largely influenced by the domestic demand and supply scenario , with major consumption coming from infrastructural development activities . 
While , the international price trend strongly influences the domestic price trend , the domestic prices do not strictly follow any single global market on a daily basis . 
Changes in duty tariffs , variations in prices of input materials like iron , coal , power , freight which influence the cost of production impact the price of steel . 
Globally , steel production has outstripped consumption in recent years , despite capacity utilization being only around 50 % in major developed markets like US , EU and Japan . 
Demand has fallen in developed countries and the demand from emerging economies like China , India and Brazil is the only stabilizing factor in the global steel market currently . 
The steel market is influenced by macro - economic factors like strength of the economy , Government spending on infrastructure , interest rates , currency movements etc as these factors have a profound influence on public , private and individual demand for steel . 
Cassiterite ( SnO2 ) is the most important mineral ore of tin . 
Tin is an important commodity in international trade and is used in hundreds of industrial processes throughout the world . 
Utilization is in many industries such as food packaging , culinary equipment , electronics , tin chemicals , plumbing solders , engineering alloys , pewter and bronze in music and the arts , dental amalgams , anti corrosion and engineering coatings , wine capsules and fire retardants . 
The industrial application of tin is in the following sectors : Solders - 32 % , Tin Plate - 27 % , Others - 17 % , Alloys - 14 % , P C Stabilizers - 6 % , Tinning - 4 % . 
The world tin production fluctuates between 2 . 4 to 3 . 1 lakh tons . 
China ( 80000 - 1 , 00 , 000 tons ) , Indonesia ( 54000 - 90000 tons ) , Peru ( 50000 - 70000 tons ) , Bolivia ( 12000 - 15000 tons ) and Brazil ( 12000 to 14000 tons ) are the major producers of tin in the world . 
These five producers account for around 91 % of the world ' s total production . 
The other important producers are Australia , Vietnam and Malaysia are the other major producers . 
United States is believed to be the world ' s largest producer of secondary tin . 
World tin consumption is estimated to have exceeded supply by 15000 tons in 2003 . 
Japan is estimated to be the largest consumer of tin in the world . The other major consumers are China and USA . 
Globally , the demand is estimated to be above the supply . 
Major Tin Markets
The London Metal exchange is the major referral market for futures trading in tin . 
Gasoline ( America ) or MoGas or petrol ( Commonwealth nations ) is a petroleum derived liquid mixture . 
Primarily used as a fuel in internal combustion engines . 
It is primarily used as fuel for passenger cars . 
It is also used in off - highway utility vans , farm machinery and in other spark ignition engines employed in a variety of service applications . 
Gasoline is a complex mixture of relatively volatile hydrocarbons , ranging from c4 to c11 that vary widely in chemical & physical properties and are derived from fractional distillation of crude petroleum in oil refineries with a further treatment mainly in terms of improvement of its octane rating . 
Small quantities of various additives are common , for purposes such as tuning engine performance or reducing harmful exhaust emissions . 
Some mixtures also contain significant quantities of ethanol as a partial alternative fuel . 
Gasoline is made by blending together various refinery streams . 
The exact ratios depend on the oil refinery that makes the gasoline , the crude oil feed used by the refinery and the grade of gasoline , in particular the octane rating . 
Many countries have set tight standards for grades of gasoline . 
Heavier crude oil gives less gasoline as the sulphur content in them is high and gasoline contains very little sulphur . 
Gasoline is derived from crude oil and its price shows high correlation with crude oil prices . 
The correlation in 2008 is estimated to have been around 93 % . 
Refineries across the world are interested in Crude - Gasoline crack . 
This is the margin that they earn when they refine crude oil into various products , especially gasoline . 
Worldwide crack margins vary from US $ 4 - 14 a barrel . 
Thus , to lock in their margins , refineries in developed countries take positions in both crude oil and gasoline derivative contracts at the same time . 
The world demand for gasoline is estimated to be an average 20 million barrels a day . 
The United States is the largest consumer with an average consumption of around 8 . 9 million barrels a day in 2008 , accounting for over 40 % of global consumption . 
This was over 9 million barrels a day in 2007 . 
Global gasoline production is reported to be above 6550 million barrels in 2007 . 
Globally , gasoline production accounted for above 23 % of the total production of refinery products in 2007 . 
US is the largest refiner of crude oil holding 20 % of the total world refining capacity of 87 , 700 kilo barrels per calendar day . 
Followed by China ( 8 . 9 % ) , Former Soviet Union ( 8 . 8 % ) , Japan ( 5 . 3 % ) and India ( 4 . 1 % ) . 
However , the production of gasoline in any country depends on the type of economy it follows . 
For eg , while US has adopted a gasoline based economy , India is largely a diesel based economy . 
Leading to more production and consumption of gasoline in US and High - Speed Diesel ( HSD ) in India . Moreover , the light sweet crude oil used by US , yields more gasoline . 
World Gasoline Markets
Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) , which has acquired New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) , runs the world’s most liquid gasoline derivative market . 
Other derivative exchanges offering this product are TOCOM , Japan and MCX , India . 
The growth of the Indian economy , rising incomes of the country ' s middle class has lead to rising numbers of passenger cars and consequently increasing demand for gasoline in India since the recent 10 - 15 years . 
India ' s consumption of gasoline in 2008 - 09 is estimated to be 82 . 5 million barrels in 2008 - 09 , which is sharply up by 36 % from 2004 - 05 consumption of 60 . 5 million barrels . 
India ' s production of gasoline has shown a sharp improvement in the previous two decades , aided by the setting up of new refineries and increased capacity utilization . 
The production of gasoline has increased from 26 million barrels in 1990 - 91 to 117 . 4 million barrels in 2008 - 09 , marking a 350 % increase . 
Gasoline exports from India have grown substantially , with it jumping from 17 . 7 million barrels in 2005 - 06 to 39 . 1 million barrels in 2008 - 09 , representing an increase of 120 % , exposing the exporting Indian refineries to the huge volatility in global prices . 
The majority of refineries in India are state - owned and follow a steady pricing policy as per Government regulations . 
The major refiners include Indian Oil Corporation Ltd ( IOCL ) , Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd ( BPCL ) , Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd ( HPCL ) and Reliance Industries Ltd ( RIL ) . 
The RIL being a private player exports most of its production of petroleum products . 
Globally , gasoline prices are highly correlated with crude oil prices as cost of production of gasoline includes the cost of crude oil used plus cost of refining , distribution , taxes and includes measures for environmental protection . 
It is estimated that crude oil alone makes up for 70 % of the price of gasoline . 
Thus , all factors influencing crude oil prices have a profound influence on gasoline prices too . 
These factors include , supply - demand , global economic scenario , natural disasters , currency fluctuations , geo - political tensions , interest rates , prices of other assets , commodities etc . 
The supply - demand scenario in US , is very important as US is the largest consumer , accounting for around 40 % of global consumption . 
Seasonal fluctuation is seen in global gasoline prices , as increased driving and air travel is seen during the summer season in temperate , developed countries . 
This increased demand supports a price rise , provided other factors remain constant . 
However , usually refineries are well stocked to meet this increased demand . 
Storage also plays an important role in trade patterns and prices . 
When inventories are full , this ready availability of large supplies drives down the price . 
In contrast , when stocks are relatively low , prices tend to increase . 
Disruptions in production due to extreme weather or other unforeseen events can lead to prices picking up .

Heating Oil
Heating oil and Diesel are classified as distillate fuel oils and rank second behind gasoline as the most - consumed liquid fuels . 
While , diesel powers heavy construction equipment , trucks , buses , tractors , trains and automobiles , heating oil ( often referred to as No . 2 fuel oil in US ) is used in the central heating of homes and small buildings . 
The main difference between the two fuels is that heating oil is allowed to contain more sulfur than diesel fuel . 
The US environment Protection Agency ( EPA ) stipulates that diesel used for transportation cannot have sulphur more than 500 ppm ( parts per million ) . 
However , heating oil is not subject to such a mandate and it usually contains around 2000 - 2500 ppm of sulphur . 
It is estimated that in the US , approximately 12 gallons of distillate are produced from a 42 - gallon barrel of crude oil . 
Of these 12 gallons of distillate , less than 2 gallons are heating oil , and the other 10 are diesel fuel . 
Diesel fuel requires additional processing to remove sulfur and is therefore more costly to produce than heating oil . 
Diesel fuel is often priced at a stable premium to the price of heating oil as both are always produced together and are chemically similar . 
As heating oil is derived from crude oil , its price shows a high correlation with crude oil prices . 
Crude - Heating Oil crack is the margin refiners earn when they refine crude oil into various products , especially heating oil , which varies between US $ 4 - 14 a barrel . 
World - over , residences and businesses are estimated to use about 10 billion gallons of heating oil each year . 
The US is the world ' s largest consumer of residential heating oil , with total consumption of residential heating oil in 2008 reported to be around 4 . 6 billion gallons . 
Of the 111 million households in the United States , approximately 8 million use heating oil as their main heating fuel . 
Globally , more than three - fourths of the distillate sales , as diesel are for transportation and only a little more than 10 % is used for residential heating . 
US is the largest refiner of crude oil holding 20 % of the total world refining capacity of 87 , 700 kilo barrels per calendar day , followed by China ( 8 . 9 % ) , Former Soviet Union ( 8 . 8 % ) , Japan ( 5 . 3 % ) and India ( 4 . 1 % ) . 
However , the production of heating oil or diesel in any country depends on the type of economy it follows . 
Leading to more production and consumption of gasoline in US and High - Speed Diesel ( HSD ) in India . 
World Heating Oil Markets
Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) , which has acquired New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) and Intercontinental Exchange run heating oil derivative markets . 
India only produces diesel , which is designated as High Speed Diesel ( HSD ) . 
The growth of the Indian economy has lead to increasing demand for energy for transportation and industry since the recent 10 - 15 years . 
As India is predominantly a diesel based economy , the demand for diesel has been increasing at a quick pace . 
India ' s consumption of High Speed Diesel in 2008 - 09 is estimated to be 15 . 9 billion gallons in 2008 - 09 , which is up by 30 % from 2004 - 05 consumption of 12 . 2 billion gallons . 
India ' s production of High Speed Diesel has shown a sharp improvement in the previous two decades , aided by the setting up of new refineries and increased capacity utilization . 
The production of High Speed Diesel has increased from 5 . 3 billion gallons in 1990 - 91 to 19 . 4 billion gallons in 2008 - 09 , marking a 265 % increase . 
High Speed Diesel exports from India have grown substantially , with it jumping from 2 . 6 billion gallons in 2005 - 06 to 4 . 2 billion gallons in 2008 - 09 , representing an increase of above 60 % , exposing the exporting Indian refineries to the huge volatility in global prices . 
Globally , heating oil prices are highly correlated with crude oil prices as cost of production of heating oil includes the cost of crude oil used plus cost of refining , distribution and storage . 
Thus , all factors influencing crude oil prices have a profound influence on heating oil prices too . 
The demand for heating oil is highly seasonal as residential - space heating is the primary application of heating oil . 
Prices are normally observed to rise during the winter months , i . e . November - March . 
The prices are also influenced by the fundamentals of diesel fuel , as both are very similar and produced together . 
Thus , when demand for on - highway diesel increases , refiners often generate a greater proportion of diesel than heating oil from the distillate stream , and vice versa when heating oil demand increases . 
The worldwide diesel demand is being propelled mainly by economic growth , particularly in developing nations , as well as a push in Europe to increase the usage of diesel vehicles . 
More than half of European cars are fueled by diesel . 
Disruptions in production due to extreme weather or other unforeseen events can also lead to prices picking up . 
Thermal Coal
Coal , a fossil fuel is a readily combustible black or brownish - black sedimentary rock normally occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds . 
It is composed primarily of carbon along with variable quantities of other elements , chiefly sulfur , hydrogen , oxygen and nitrogen . 
Coal is extracted from the ground by mining , either underground or in open pits . 
The degree of change undergone by a coal as it matures from peat to anthracite is known as coalification . 
Coalification has an important bearing on coal ' s physical and chemical properties and is referred to as the ' rank ' of the coal . 
Low rank coals comprising of lignite or brown coal ( 17 % ) and sub - bituminous coal ( 30 % ) account for 47 % of total global coal reserves . 
While lignite is largely used for power generation , sub - bituminous coal is used for electricity generation , cement manufacture and by industry . 
Hard coal ( 53 % ) includes bituminous coal ( 52 % ) and anthracite ( 1 % ) . Bituminous coal is further classified into thermal / steam coal and metallurgical / coking coal . 
Thermal coal is used for power generation , cement manufacture and has industrial applications . 
Coking coal is used largely for manufacture of iron and steel . Anthracite has both domestic and industrial uses . 
Coal reserves are available in almost every country worldwide , with recoverable reserves in around 70 countries . 
Global proven coal reserves are estimated to last for 122 years at current production levels , as against 42 and 60 years respectively for proven oil and gas reserves . 
The total global proven reserves are estimated to be around 910 billion tonnes , with USA ( 27 % ) , Russia ( 17 % ) , China ( 13 % ) , India ( 10 % ) and Australia ( 9 % ) holding major share of the reserves . 
Global hard coal and brown coal ( lignite ) production is estimated at 5845 million tonnes ( m . t . ) and 951 million tonnes in 2008 respectively . 
China ( 2761 m . t . ) , USA ( 1007 m . t . ) , India ( 490 m . t . ) , Australia ( 325 m . t . ) , Russia ( 247 m . t . ) and Indonesia ( 246 m . t . ) are the major global coal producers . 
The top three producers account for 73 % of the total production . 
Global hard coal consumption is estimated at 5814 m . t . in 2008 . 
The economic progress of the world , especially in the emerging countries has lead to consumption sharply increasing by around 65 % from levels of around 3500 m . t . in 1990 ' s
Coal provides 26 . 5 % of global primary energy needs and generates 41 . 5 % of the world ' s electricity . 
The countries heavily dependent on coal for electricity generation include South Africa ( 94 % ) , China ( 81 % ) , Australia ( 76 % ) , India ( 68 % ) and USA ( 49 % ) . 
Steel industry is estimated to use approximately 13 % ( around 717 m . t . ) of total hard coal production and almost 70 % of total global steel production is dependent on coal . 
The global hard coal trade in 2008 is estimated to be around 938 m . t . , with total trade in thermal coal estimated to be 676 m . t . 
The major global exporters of thermal coal in 2008 are Indonesia ( 173 m . t . ) , Australia ( 115 m . t . ) , Russia ( 86 m . t . ) and Columbia ( 74 m . t . ) . 
The major global importers of thermal coal in 2008 are Japan ( 128 m . t . ) , Korea ( 76 m . t . ) , Chinese Taipei ( 60 m . t . ) . 
World Thermal Coal Markets
Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ) , which offers European and South African coal contracts , runs the world’s most liquid coal derivative market . 
Coal futures are also traded on Chicago Mercantile Exchange , which has acquired NYMEX . 
Coal is the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India and it meets 55 % of the country ' s energy need . 
It is estimated that about 75 % of total coal consumed in the country and 80 % of the domestic production is used for power generation
India is the world ' s third largest coal producer with production of around 493 million tonnes in 2008 - 09 . 
India ' s hard coal reserves are estimated to be around 246 billion tonnes , of which 92 billion tonnes are proven . 
Hard coal deposits of 56 billion tonnes are spread over 27 major coalfields , mainly confined to eastern and south central parts of the country . 
The lignite reserves stand at a level around 36 billion tonnes , of which 90 % occur in Tamil Nadu . 
India ' s total imports of hard coal in 2008 is estimated to be 60 million tonnes ( m . t . ) , of which 31 million tonnes is of thermal coal and 29 million tonnes is of coking coal . 
The imports of thermal coal has increased substantially from 10 . 31 m . t . in 2002 - 03 to 23 m . t . in 2006 - 07 and to 28 . 9 m . t . in 2007 - 08 . 
The import requirements are projected to growth further to over 40 m . t . in coming years . 
Despite , India ' s vast coal reserves the country has become more dependent on imports of thermal coal over the recent years . 
The poor quality of indigenous coal supplies , logistics problems and lowering of import duty has made imports a preferred choice for cement manufacturers , some other industries , power plants , along the southern and western coasts . 
Coal demand is highly dependent on energy demand , as it is the major source for power generation in many countries . 
Significant demand from China and India is increasingly accounting for the bulk of worldwide coal usage . 
Hence , coal demand and consequently coal prices are dependent on the economic scenario in the emerging markets , particularly China and India
Coal prices are influenced by the price scenario in other fossil fuels used for energy generation , viz . , oil and gas as if these become expensive , demand will increase for coal and cause rise in its prices too . 
Despite , coal being a finite resource , supply is not an issue in the medium term as global reserves are still large , and technologies for the extraction and utilisation of coal are improving . 
As coal is a globally traded commodity , its prices are influenced by macro - economic factors like global economic scenario , currency fluctuations , geo - political tensions , interest rates , prices of other assets , commodities etc .

Crude Palm Oil
Palm oil is obtained from fresh fruit bunches ( FFB ) of oil palm cultivated in plantations . 
There are several commercial variants of palm oil available viz . , Crude Palmoil , Crude Palmolein , RBD ( Refined Bleached Deoderised ) Palmoil , RBD Palmolien and Palm Kernel Oil . 
Crude Palmoil when subjected to refining results in the other factions . 
Palmoil with an annual production of 25 - 27 million tons is second most produced oil in the world . 
Malaysia ( 13 million tons ) and Indonesia ( 10 million tons ) are the major producers . They together account for 85 % of production . 
Around 80 % ( 21 - 23 million tons ) of global production is exported . 
Malaysia and Indonesia with 12 - 12 . 5 and 6 - 7 million tons respectively are major exporters . 
India , China and EU are the major importers . 
Price competitiveness has been reason for increased consumption of this oil . 
Important World Palmoil Markets
Bursa Malaysian Derivatives ( BMD ) is the largest futures market for crude palmoil . 
Malaysian & Indonesian FOB prices set the mood in the physical market . 
India imports roughly 2 . 5 - 3 . 5 million tons of palmoil and its variants a year . The domestic production is very meager at 0 . 5 lakh tons . 
India imposes 65 % duty on crude oil and 75 % ( imposed in 2003 - 04 Union Budget ) on RBD Palmoil . 
The import ratio is highly dependent on the duty imposed . 
In addition to the customs duty , Government of India also imposes tariff value , on which the customs duty is calculated irrespective of the actual price at which the oil is imported . 
In 2002 - 03 India imported 21 . 5 lakh tons of crude palmoil and 3 . 15 lakh tons of RBD Palmoil . 
Kandla , Mumbai , Kakinada are the major ports for palmoil entry to India and the major trading points too .

Kapasia Khalli ( Cottonseed Oilcake ) 
Kapaskhalli ( cottonseed extraction / meal ) is a byproduct of the cottonseed industry . 
Cottonseed is a by - product of the cotton plant , which is primarily grown for its fibre . 
Although cotton has been grown for its fiber for several thousand years , the use of cottonseed on a commercial scale is of relatively recent origin . 
Cottonseed was a raw agricultural product , which was once largely wasted . 
Now it is being converted into food for people ; feed for livestock ; fertilizer and mulch for plants ; fiber for furniture padding ; and cellulose for a wide range of products from explosives to computer chip boards . 
Annually around 15 - 16 . 5 million tons of cottonseed meal is produced globally . 
Globally , the oil content of cottonseed is 18 % , and the remaining portion is the cottonseed meal . 
Most of the production of cottonseed meal is consumed in the country of production itself , limiting the global trade to just 5 - 6 lakh tons a year . 
China ( 1 - 1 . 2 lakh tons ) is the single largest exporter , while Europe ( 2 lakh tons ) , South Korea ( 1 - 1 . 5 lakh tons ) are the largest importers of cottonseed meal . 
Cottonseed is the second most commonly produced oilseed in the world just slightly ahead of soy . 
The global production of cottonseed is around 35 million tons in the recent years . 
The major producers of cotton are also the major producers of cottonseed . China , USA , India , Pakistan , Uzbekistan and Brazil are the major producers globally . 
Cottonseed is a traditional oilseed of India . 
It is estimated that cottonseed production will be around 33 % of the cotton production in bales . 
Around 80 % of the seed is marketable surplus and arrives in the market for being crushed to oil . 
The remaining is used as seed is fed to cattle . 
India ' s cotton output and along with it the cottonseed , meal and oil output varies considerably from year to year in response to the vagaries of weather and pest attacks . 
India ' s cottonseed production in 2002 - 03 and 2003 - 04 is estimated at 36 . 3 and 43 . 4 lakh tons respectively . 
India produces around 2 million tons of cottonseed meal a year . 
The protein content of the scientifically produced meal is 40 - 42 % against 20 - 22 % in the traditionally processed meal . 
However , in India mainly undecorticated meal is largely produced . 
Several associations are promoting the production of decorticated cake in India and the production of this is expected to increase in the country . 
India used to be a major exporter of cottonseed extraction around two decades ago . 
However , the demand for other oil meals like soymeal , has lowered the cottonseed demand globally . 
In addition , the low availability of decorticated meal in India has also been a major reason for the fall in exports . 
The major importers of Indian cottonseed meal ( undecorticated ) used to be Thailand . 
India in 2002 - 03 exported only 50 tons of decorticated cottonseed meal . 
In 2003 - 04 , too there have been no significant exports . 
India does not import cottonseed meal . 
Major Trading centres
Akola , Parbhani , Nagpur , Yeotmal are the major trading centers where cottonseed from the cotton procured by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Cotton Growers Marketing Federation is auctioned off . 
Cottonseed is sold through weekly auctions in Maharashtra . 
In other states , there is an active cash market in the season . 
Cottonseed arrives in the market as a by - product of ginning operation carried on cotton . 
It is sold off immediately . 
The industry is largely un - organised . 
Athough several associations have been trying for the upliftment of the industry and scientific processing practices . 
The prices of oil and meal display good volatility , with it falling during the peak arrival period ( October - January .

Refined Soya Oil
Soybeans on crushing and solvent extraction yield soyoil at 18 % recovery and soymeal . 
About 85 % is crushed worldwide . 
Soybean and soyoil production of 170 - 185 and 25 - 31 million tons account for 55 - 58 % and 25 - 30 % of global oilseed and oil production respectively . 
US , Brazil , Argentina , China , India are the major producers in order of production . 
In US , India , China crop starts arriving from Aug - Sept , while it starts from Jan - Feb in S . America . 
In the world 55 - 60 , 8 - 10 and 42 - 45 million tons of beans , oil and meal are traded annually . 
USA ( 20 - 30 million tons ) , Brazil ( 12 - 18 million tons ) , Argentina ( 5 - 10 million tons ) are the exporters of beans , while China ( 18 - 20 million tons ) and EU ( 15 - 18 million tons ) are the major importers . 
Argentina ( 3 - 5 million tons ) and Brazil ( 2 - 3 million tons ) are the major exporters of oil . 
China ( 1 . 5 - 2 . 5 million tons ) and India ( 1 - 2 million tons ) are the major importers of oil . 
Crushers , refined oil manufacturers , animal feed manufacturers and farmers are the major stakeholders in the soy value chain worldwide .

Soybean is an important global crop and processed soybean is the largest source of protein feed and second largest source of vegetable oil in the world . 
The major portion of the global and domestic crop is solvent - extracted with hexane to yield soy oil and obtain soymeal , which is widely used in the animal feed industry . 
It is estimated that above 85 % of the output is crushed worldwide . 
Though , a very small proportion of the crop is consumed directly by humans , soybean products appear in a large variety of processed foods . 
The cultivation of soybean is successful in climates with hot summers , with temperatures between 20°C to 30°C being optimum . 
Temperatures below 20°C and over 40°C are found to retard growth significantly . 
It can grow in a wide range of soils , with optimum growth in moist alluvial soils with a good organic content . 
Modern soybean varieties generally reach a height of around 1 m ( 3 ft ) , and take 80 - 120 days from sowing to harvesting . 
The annual global soybean production has been in the range of 210 - 230 million tonnes in the recent years , accounting for 55 - 58 % of total global oilseed output of around 390 - 400 million tonnes . 
US , Brazil , Argentina , China and India are the major producers in order of production with production in these countries ranging around 70 - 80 , 55 - 60 , 32 - 48 , 14 - 16 and 8 - 10 million tonnes in the recent couple of years . 
Weather , acreage under other competitive crops like corn , cotton and pests & diseases are the major factors influencing production . 
While in US , India and China crop starts arriving from Aug - Sept , it starts from Jan - Feb in S . America . 
The annual global trade in soybean is estimated to be around 70 - 80 million tonnes . 
While , USA ( 30 - 35 million tonnes ) , Brazil ( 23 - 28 million tonnes ) , Argentina ( 5 - 15 million tonnes ) are the exporters of beans , China ( 35 - 40 million tonnes ) and EU ( 12 - 16 million tonnes ) are the major importers . 
In addition to soybean , soy oil and soymeal are also widely traded globally with annual trade of around 9 million tonnes and 52 million tonnes respectively . 
While , US is the largest exporters for soybeans , Argentina is the largest exporter of soy oil and soy meal globally .

India ' s annual production of soybean has been around 8 . 5 - 10 million tonnes in the recent years with India ' s production in 2009 - 10 estimated to be around 8 . 9 million tonnes by the Government of India . 
The acreage under this crop has more than doubled in the past two decades to around 11 million hectares currently being sown under this crop , with better returns encouraging more farmers to adopt this new crop . 
Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra , Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh are the major cultivators of this important oilseed , with their respective contributions usually around 60 % , 25 % , 6 - 7 % and 1 - 2 % . 
Soybean is exclusively grown in the khariff season in India , with sowing taking place after the first monsoon showers in late June or early July . 
Sowing can extend upto end of July in different parts of the country . 
The harvesting commences from September , with Maharashtra reporting the earliest arrivals . 
October and November are the peak arrival months , with all - India arrivals crossing 10 lakh bags of approximately 90 kg on the peak arrival days . 
The production is dependent on the monsoon and fluctuates between years . 
India is highly dependent on imports to meet domestic edible oil requirement . Government policies are in favour of developing the domestic crushing industry and supporting Indian farmers and do not promote import or export of soybean . 
Thus , there is virtually no import or export of soybeans . 
However , India out of its total soymeal production of around 6 . 5 - 7 million tonnes , exports around 3 . 5 million tonnes with Vietnam , Japan , Thailand , Indonesia , UAE , Greece being the major importers . 
Indore , Ujjain , Dewas , Mandsore in Madhya Pradesh , Akola , Sangli , Nagpur in Maharashtra , Kota in Rajasthan are major trading centres . 
Domestic prices are highly influenced by the global price movements , with prices highly correlated with the CME prices . 
Fundamentally , weather at all producing centers , domestic and international is the most crucial factor , with the pod bearing period , being the most crucial . 
United States Department of Agriculture makes progressive assessment of crops , stocks , global supply and demand and releases regular reports , which are widely looked upon by the global market to determine prices . 
The other major influencing factor is the prices of soy oil and soymeal , which are in - turn dependent on the fundamentals of global edible oil and global animal feed industry . 
Locally , prices are influenced by currency fluctuations , weather , acreage , pest & diseases , production estimates by industry associations , Government agencies . 
India imports more than 60 % of its entire edible oil requirement and the entire edible oilseed and oil sector is a highly sensitive sector . 
Thus , new Government policies and apprehensions about new policies have a strong sway over prices , during periods when new announcements are made or are about to be made . 
Barley ( Hordeum vulgare L . ) ( Hindi name : Jau ) , a cereal grain derived from an annual grass is the fourth most important cereal crop in the world after rice , wheat and maize . 
Barley is very adaptable and is a widely grown crop . 
It is cultivated as a summer crop in temperate areas and as a winter crop in tropical areas . 
Barley has a short growing season and is also relatively drought tolerant . 
However , it is a tender grain and care has to be taken in all stages of its growth and harvest . 
Barley is used as livestock feed , human food and barley malt . 
While , historically , livestock consumed most of barley produced globally , this is no more the case now . 
Currently food and industrial consumption of barley is more prominent . 
Barley along with corn / maize , sorghum ( jowar ) , oats , pearl millet ( bajra ) , finger millet ( ragi ) and other minor millets are grouped together as coarse cereals . 
The annual global barley production has been in the range of 130 - 140 million tonnes in the recent years . 
However , in 2008 - 09 it is estimated to have risen sharply to 158 million tonnes . 
The total average production of all coarse cereals in the recent years has been around 1000 million tonnes . 
European Union , Russia , Ukraine , Canada , Australia , Turkey and USA are the major producers of barley accounting for around 75 % of the total global production , with average production in these regions being around 55 , 18 , 10 , 10 , 6 , 6 , 4 - 5 million tonnes respectively in the recent years . 
Following corn , barley is the second largest coarse cereal traded globally . 
The global trade in barley is reported to be around 17 - 18 million tonnes , with Ukraine ( 4 - 5 million tonnes ) , Russia ( 2 - 3 million tonnes ) , Australia ( 2 - 3 ) and EU - 27 ( 2 - 3 million tonnes ) being the major global exporters . 
The major importing nations are Saudi Arabia ( 6 - 8 million tonnes ) , China ( 1 - 1 . 5 million tonnes ) and Japan ( 1 - 1 . 5 million tonnes . 
While , Saudi Arabia imports barley mainly for feed , Japan and China import it for both feed and malt production
The global malt production is estimated to be around 22 million tonnes , more than 90 % of which is produced from barley . 
It is estimated that around 94 % of global malt production is used for making beer . 
The EU accounts for approximately 42 % of the world ' s malt production . 
Barley is cultivated as a rabi crop in India , with sowing being undertaken from October to December and harvesting from March to May . 
India ' s annual production of Barley has been steadily around 1 . 2 - 1 . 5 million tonnes in the recent years , with production in 2008 - 09 estimated to be around 1 . 54 million tonnes . 
The area under cultivation has also stabilized at around 0 . 7 - 0 . 8 lakh hectares , with a per hectare yield of around 1944 kg . 
Latest state wise data available is that of 2005 - 06 from the Ministry of Agriculture . 
But it gives a fair picture of land use for the crop of barley . 
The major producers of Barley in the country are Rajasthan ( 40 % ) , Uttar Pradesh ( 34 % ) , Madhya Pradesh ( 8 % ) , Haryana ( 6 % ) and Punjab ( 5 % ) . 
Some cultivation is also undertaken in Bihar , Himachal Pradesh , and Uttaranchal . 
In addition , to direct human consumption barley is utilized by the beer industry , food processing industry and feed manufacturing industry in India . 
Annual demand from beer and feed industry is estimated to be around 60 , 000 tonnes and 25 , 000 tonnes respectively . 
However , rising demand for beer among India ' s urban young consumers is leading to increased demand for barley malt from Indian beer manufacturing units . 
The country ' s beer consumption in volume terms is projected to grow by almost 51 % percent between 2006 and 2011 . 
During 2001 - 06 , it is estimated to have grown by around 45 % to over 907 million litres . 
India ' s barley production is projected to increase to around 2 million tonnes in a couple of years to meet the rising demand for barley malt . 
The major markets are located in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh . 
The three largest markets are Kota , Ramganj Mandi and Baran in Rajasthan
Rising industrial demand is the main influencing factor in the Indian markets currently . 
While , demand from feed sector is more or less constant , demand from beer and food processing sectors are picking up . 
The price of other coarse cereals influences the demand from the feed sector and in - turn influences barley prices . 
Easier proximity to Middle - east countries has increased the export demand . 
The amount of exports undertaken influences prices significantly . 
It was the high export in 2007 - 8 and 2008 - 9 that resulted in the prices of Barley zooming to the high of almost 1300 in March 2008 . 
The reports of rising beer consumption in India is leading to major global barley / barley malt producers eyeing India as a probable buyer in the coming years . 
Currently , India does not import barley . Picking up of imports can alter the current Indian supply - demand dynamics and become a major price influencing factor . 
The Government announces Minimum Support Price ( MSP ) for barley . 
However , Government procurement has been rarely undertaken , as there is no surplus production in the country . 
Wheat is one of the world ' s three most important cereal crops along with maize and rice . 
It is reported to be grown domestically from atleast as early as 9000 BC and is now grown in almost all parts of the world . 
Wheat is a globally important source of dietary carbohydrate ( starch ) and protein ( gluten ) . 
Its grain is a staple food used to make flour for leavened , flat and steamed breads , biscuits , cookies , cakes , breakfast cereal , pasta , noodles etc and for fermentation to make beer , alcohol , vodka , or biofuel . 
It is also used for feeding animals to a limited extent . 
Different varieties of wheat are grown across the world . 
The three principal types of wheat used in modern food production are : 
Triticum vulgare ( soft wheat ) , Triticum durum ( hard wheat ) and Triticum compactum
The annual global wheat production has been in the range of 600 - 630 tonnes in the recent years . 
However , in 2008 - 09 it is estimated to have risen sharply to 689 million tonnes . 
The combined production of all cereals in 2008 - 09 is estimated to be 2525 million tonnes . 
EU - 27 , China , India , USA and Russia are the five major producers of wheat accounting for close to 70 % of the total global production , with 2008 - 09 production in these regions being 151 , 112 . 5 , 78 . 6 , 68 and 63 . 8 million tonnes respectively . 
Wheat is the most important cereal traded in the world market . 
The global trade in wheat during 2008 - 09 was sharply up at around 140 million tonnes in 2008 - 09 from an average of around 110 - 115 million tonnes in the recent previous years . 
While US ( 25 - 35 million tonnes ) , EU - 27 ( 15 - 25 million tonnes ) , Canada ( 15 - 20 million tonnes ) , Australia ( 8 - 18 million tonnes ) and Argentina ( 6 - 12 million tonnes ) are major exporters , there are a large number of countries importing wheat with maximum demand emanating from developing nations . 
The major importing regions are Middle - east Asia , South - east Asia and North - west Africa . Egypt , Brazil , Indonesia , Algeria are the most important importing nations . 
Wheat crops around the world have their own unique production cycles of planting and harvest timeframes .

US FOB and EU ( France ) FOB prices determine the physical prices
India has the largest area in the world under wheat cultivation . 
However , due to low productivity it is only the third largest producer after EU - 27 and China . 
India ' s annual production of wheat has been around 75 - 79 million tonnes from 2006 - 07 . 
with production in 2008 - 09 estimated to be around 78 . 6 million tonnes . 
Wheat accounts for around 30 - 35 % of India ' s total foodgrain production of around 220 million tonnes . 
India ' s annual wheat consumption is estimated to be around 72 million tonnes currently . 
Green revolution and increased focus by Government on wheat has helped wheat production to surge sharply from around 6 million tonnes at time of independence to current levels . 
Close to 90 % of the area under wheat is irrigated , which too has supported the rise in output over the years . 
Uttar Pradesh ( 34 % ) , Punjab ( 20 % ) , Haryana ( 13 % ) , Rajasthan ( 10 % ) and Madhya Pradesh ( 10 % ) are the main wheat producing states of India . 
Wheat is cultivated as a rabi crop in India . 
With sowing being undertaken from October to December and harvesting from March to May . 
The official marketing season of wheat in India is assumed to commence from April . 
Government plays a major role in the wheat value chain in India as the cereal is very important for the country ' s food security . 
The Central Govt . sets the Minimum Support Price ( MSP ) every year , which sets the mood for the upcoming season . 
As govt . agencies have been recently procuring close to 25 - 30 % of annual production , open market prices too do not generally fall below this price . 
Historically , the procurement has been around 15 - 20 % . 
The procured wheat is used to maintain a minimum buffer stock for meeting unforeseen exigencies , for providing foodgrains required for Public Distribution System ( PDS ) and the other foodgrain based welfare programmes of the Government . 
In addition , the grain is also sold at pre - determined prices to the open market . 
Though , India is not a major player in global markets India has resorted to imports , whenever there is a supply tightness . 
India has also exported around 5 million tonnes of wheat in 2003 - 04 . 
Govt . agencies take the decision to bring in imports and the current policies are not in favour of exports . 
Wheat is an annual , seasonal crop and prices usually tend to rise during the cultivation period , i . e . December to March due to scarcity in the market and dip during the peak arrival period ( April and May ) . 
Weather has a profound influence on production , especially in Haryana and Punjab as temperature plays a crucial role in determining the yield . 
The Govt . policies with regard to MSP , buffer stocks , PDS sales , Open Market Sales , imports / exports are very important influencing factor with regards to Indian wheat prices . 
Despite international trade being limited , the several variations in production or consumption at various major or minor producing or consuming country , which influence global prices , are reflected in the domestic long - term price trend . 
However , in the short - term normally there is no significant relation with international prices . 
Several international agencies like US Dept . of Agriculture , International Grains Council , Food and Agricultural Organisation release regular , periodic reports on global supply - demand situation , which is widely looked upon by the global players . 
Maize - Feed / Industrial Grade
Maize ( Corn ) , is of American origin , and after wheat and rice , it is the most important cereal grain in the world . 
It provides nutrition to both humans ( 33 . 3 % ) and animals ( 66 . 6 % ) . 
Serves as basic raw material for the production of starch , oil and protein , alcoholic beverages , food sweeteners and more recently fuel . 
Special crops grown primarily for food include sweet corn and popcorn , although dent , starchy or floury and flint maize are also widely used as food . 
Immature ordinary corn on the cob either boiled or roasted is widely consumed . 
World corn production in the year 2003 was 614 . 3 million tons while in year 2004 total world corn production is expected to be 642 . 6 million tons . 
Major producing countries are United States , China , EU - 25 , Brazil , Mexico , Argentina and India . 
These countries accounts for around 80 % of total world corn production . 
Major consuming nations of corn are China and USA . 
There has been continuous increase in the consumption demand of corn mainly owing to increase in the demand from meat and starch sector . 
There is growing requirement of maize from poultry sector , which uses corn as feed . 
Major importing nations of maize are Japan , Korea , Taiwan , Mexico , Egypt , Malaysia , EU and Colombia . 
Among the major exporters of corn , USA stands first followed by Argentina and Brazil . 
China , South Africa , Ukraine are minor exporters , their share is very low . 
Only USA dominates the international trade of corn as an exporter . 
India ' s maize production fluctuates between 10 - 14 million tons , with 80 - 90 % of the production being in the kharif season . 
Major states that contribute in Maize productions are Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Bihar , Punjab , Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh . 
Around 6 . 5 million tons ( roughly 50 % of total consumption ) goes for feed use , primarily for poultry feed . 
Another 1 million tons of corn is used by the starch industry . 
India is traditionally a maize importer , and Govt . permits a fixed quantity ( determined each year ) to be imported at 15 % . 
Extra has to be imported at 50 % . 
However , in 2003 - 04 , India exported around 3 - 5 lakh tons of maize , mainly to Southeast Asian countries . 
Rising household incomes have shifted human consumption from maize to other cereals like rice and wheat . 
The rising incomes have also led to an increased consumption of meat , particularly of poultry , which has increased the demand for maize as feed . 
Factors that Affects Rice / Wheat / Maize Prices
Role of weather in crop production is immense . 
Temperature , rainfall and soil moisture are the important parameters that determine the crop condition . 
Further , natural calamities like typhoon , floods , droughts and earthquake can also affect crops . 
Markets keep watch of these developments . 
Changes in the minimum support prices ( MSP ) by the government also have immense impact on the prices of the commodity . 
Availability of substitute products at cheaper rate may lead to weakness in demand . 
This situation happens especially when the main products price tends to become higher . 
For e . g . , jowar / bajra may be preferred by poultry feed manufacturers instead of maize , if its prices are high
Seasonal cycles are present in agriculture crops , particularly in short duration annual crops . Price tends to be lower as harvesting progresses and produce starts coming into the market . 
At the time of sowing and before harvesting price tends to rise in view of tight supply situation . 
Breakthrough in the technology may increase the productivity and would lead to more supply . 
This may bring some softness in the price . 
Carbon ( CFI ) 
CARBON CREDITS – A MARKET OF THE 21st CENTURY
With growing concerns among nations to curb pollution levels while maintaining the growth in their economic activities , the emission trading ( ET ) industry has come to life . 
And , with the increasing ratification of Kyoto Protocol ( KP ) by countries and rising social accountability of polluting industries in the developed nations , the carbon emissions trading is likely to emerge as a multibillion - dollar market in global emissions trading . 
The recent surge in carbon credits trading activities in Europe is an indication of how the emissions trading industry is going to pan out in the years to come . 
What is a carbon credit ? 
Simply put , one carbon credit is equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent greenhouse gas ( GHG ) . 
Carbon credits are “Entitlement Certificates” issued by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) to the implementers of the approved Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) projects . 
The potential buyers of carbon credits shall be corporates in various Annexure I countries that need to meet the compliance prevailing in their countries as per the Kyoto Protocol or those investors who would like buy the credits and with the expectation of selling them at a higher price during the KP phase ( 2008 - 12 ) . 
The extension of KP shall be ratified by the current signatories of KP in their future meetings essentially to curb GHG emissions into the environment . 
Sources of demand & supply
Emerging carbon credit markets offer enormous opportunities for the upcoming manufacturing / public utility projects to employ a range of energy saving devices or any other mechanisms or technology to reduce GHG emissions and earn carbon credits to be sold at a price . 
The carbon credits can be either generated by project participants who acquire carbon credits through implementation of CDM in Non Annexure I countries or through Joint Implementation ( JI ) in Annexure I countries or supplied into the market by those who got surplus allowances with them . 
The buyers of carbon credits are principally from Annexure I countries . They are : 
Especially European nations , as currently European Union Emission Trading Scheme ( EU ETS ) is the most active market ; 
Other markets include Japan , Canada , New Zealand , etc . 
The major sources of supply are Non - Annexure I countries such as India , China , and Brazil . 
Trading In Carbon Credits
Emissions trading ( ET ) is a mechanism that enables countries with legally binding emissions targets to buy and sell emissions allowances among themselves . 
Currently , futures contracts in carbon credits are actively traded in the European exchanges . 
In fact , many companies actively participate in the futures market to manage the price risks associated with trading in carbon credits and other related risks such as project risk , policy risk , etc . 
Keeping in view the various risks associated with carbon credits , trading in futures contracts in carbon allowances has now become a reality in Europe with burgeoning volumes . 
Currently , project participants , public utilities , manufacturing entities , brokers , banks , and others actively participate in futures trading in environment - related instruments . 
In Non - Annexure B countries ( the developing countries ) across the world , CER prices are influenced by various factors including EUA prices , crude oil prices , electricity , coal , natural gas , the level of economic activities across Annexure I countries , among others
Some of the major price influencing factors : 
Supply - demand mismatch
Policy issues
Crude oil prices
Coal prices
CO2 emissions
Weather / Fuel prices
European Union Allowances ( EUAs ) prices
Foreign exchange fluctuations
Global economic growth
Risks associated with carbon credits
There are market - and policy - related risks for CER producers , including the supply - side risks starting from the DNA approval risk to the CER issuance risk in a complete CDM approval cycle . 
Apart from these risks there are a host of other risks from both the supply and demand sides that the real market players confront with . 
Most CDM projects by their very nature take a long time to generate the CERs and hence , face the aforesaid risks in large proportion , which if not hedged would lead to reduced realization . 
Under such a situation , the realization of CER generators at times may not even cover the investment put in to generate the CERs and thus , has the potential of even making a CDM project unviable in the long term . 
Given the long gestation period of CDM projects and the risks involved , it is rather inevitable that they pre - sell their potential credits in the futures market ( preferably a domestic futures market , to avoid forex risk attached to participation in a foreign exchange ) and thereby , cover their probable downside in the physical market . 
Potential participants in carbon credits trading are as below
Intermediaries in spot markets
Ultimate buyers
Arbitragers
Portfolio managers
Diverse participants with wide participation objectives
Commodity financers
Funding agencies
Corporates having risk exposure in energy products
India as a potential supplier
India , being one of the leading generators of CERs through CDM , has a large scope in emissions trading . 
Analysts forecast that its trading in carbon credits would touch US $ 100 billion by 2010 . 
Currently , the total registered CDM projects are more than 300 , almost 1 / 3rd of the total CDM projects registered with the UNFCCC . 
The total issued CERs with India as a host country till now stand at 34 , 101 , 315 ( around 34 million ) , again around 1 / 3rd of the total CERs issued by the UNFCCC . 
In value terms ( INR ) , it could be running into thousands of crores . 
Further , there has been a surge in number of registered projects in India . 
In 2007 , a total of 160 new projects were registered with the UNFCCC indicating that more than half of all registered projects in India happened last year . 
It is expected that with increasing awareness this would go further up in the future . 
The number of expected annual CERs in India is hovering around 28 million and considering that each of these CERs is sold for around 15 euros , on an average , the expected value is going to be around Rs 2 , 500 crore . 
Various industries that have scope of generation of CERs : 
Energy ( renewable & non - renewable sources ) 
Fugitive emissions from fuels ( solid , oil and gas ) 
Metal production
Mining and mineral production
Afforestation & reforestation
The role of MCX
With MCX keen to play a major role on the emission front by extending its platform to add carbon credits to its existing basket of commodities with regard to commodities futures trading . 
The existing and potential suppliers of carbon credits in India have geared up to generate more carbon credits from their existing and ongoing projects to be sold in the international markets . 
With India supposed to be a major supplier of carbon credits , the tie - up between the two exchanges is expected to ensure better price discovery of carbon credits , besides covering risks associated with buying and selling . 
Advantages of an MCX carbon contract
In India , currently only bilateral deals and trading through intermediaries are widely prevalent leading to sellers being denied fair prices for their carbon credits . 
Advantages that the MCX platform offers are : 
Sellers and intermediaries can hedge against price risk ; 
Advance selling could help projects generate liquidity and thereby , reduce costs of implementation ; 
There is no counterparty risk as the Exchange guarantees the trade ; 
The price discovery on the Exchange platform ensures a fair price for both the buyer and the seller ; 
Players are brought to a single platform , thus , eliminating the laborious process of identifying either buyers or sellers with enough credibility ; 
The MCX futures floor gives an immediate reference price . 
At present , there is no transparency related to prices in the Indian carbon credit market , which has kept sellers at the receiving end with no bargaining power . 
Almonds , though considered to be nuts are technically the seed of the fruit of the almond tree , which is a medium - sized tree that bears fragrant pink and white flowers . 
The fruit , botanically referred to as a drupe has an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed inside . 
Almonds are commonly sold shelled . 
Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed . 
Almonds with their shells attached are called unshelled almonds . 
Blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat , which is then removed to reveal the white embryo . 
Sweet almonds and Bitter almonds are two forms of almonds , of which sweet almond is the variety , which is consumed directly or indirectly by humans as a food product . 
Bitter almond is slightly shorter and broader than sweet almonds and are mainly used for extracting almond oil and not consumed as food , as it is poisonous . 
Chocolate confectionary , bakery and snacking are the three major global categories for almond usage . 
The annual global Sweet almond production on shelled - basis has been in the range of 7 - 8 . 5 lakh tonnes in the recent years . Record crops and a steady increase in production were seen from 2005 - 06 to 2008 - 09 ( Almond crop year is from August to July ) . 
However , the output in 2009 - 10 is forecasted to dip on account of unfavourable climatic conditions . 
United States of America is the single largest producer , consumer and exporter of Sweet almonds , with the country contributing to over 80 % of the global almond production . 
The state of California in US is the most important producer of Sweet almonds , as this region is reported to be accounting for 99 % of the American production . 
Nonpareil is the single largest variety planted in California . 
Its production is reported to be 38 % of the total output , followed by Carmel ( 12 % ) , Monterey ( 10 % ) , Butte / Padre ( 9 % ) and Butte ( 8 % ) . 
The world ' s largest almond handler is the Blue Diamond Growers Cooperative , which is located in Sacramento , California . 
Blue Diamond is owned by over two - thirds of California growers and markets one - third of California ' s crop . 
The other producing countries are Australia , Turkey , Chile , European Union , China and India with a production of 26 , 000 tonnes , 16 , 000 , 9500 , 79 , 800 , 1 , 500 and 1 , 200 tonnes on a shelled basis in 2008 - 09 . Spain is the single largest producer in the European Union . 
The annual trade in almonds has been around 4 . 6 lakh tonnes ( on shelled basis ) in the recent years . 
The major exporters are US , Australia and Chile with exports of 4 , 40 , 000 tonnes , 12 , 300 tonnes and 6 , 700 tonnes ( on shelled basis ) in 2008 - 09 . 
European Union , India , Japan , Canada and Turkey are the major importers with imports of 2 , 00 , 000 tonnes , 45 , 000 tonnes , 21 , 000 tonnes , 19 , 000 tonnes and 14 , 000 tonnes in 2008 - 09 . 
While , the peak harvesting period of the Californian crop starts from mid - August and extends till September that of Australian crop occurs between February and April . 
The ever - expanding middle class and increase in health awareness , has lead the growing consumption of almond in the country in recent years . 
The annual rate of increase in India ' s domestic consumption of almonds is reported to be around 20 % . 
More than 95 % of almonds consumed by Indians is imported with more than 80 % of imports being sourced from California . 
The other major country from which India imports almonds is Australia . 
While , Indian imports in 2008 - 09 is reported to be above 45 , 000 tonnes , the imports in 2009 - 10 are expected to rise to 50 , 000 tonnes . 
India has to resort to imports to meet almost its entire requirements as domestic production of sweet almonds is only around 1 , 200 tonnes . 
The other almond trees present in the country are of non - descript variety and mostly produce bitter almonds . 
India imports almonds with shells and processes it domestically to obtain shelled almonds , unlike almost all other importing nations , which import shelled almonds . 
This is due to availability of cheap labour and better appearance and lesser losses in manual shelling of almonds as against mechanized shelling . 
Most of the manual shelling of almonds in India is undertaken at Bombay and New Delhi , from where the shelled almonds are transported to other consumption centres . 
The Indian festival season extending from September to December is the peak consumption period for almonds , with maximum demand witnessed in November . 
Thus heavy imports of new Californian almonds are seen from September to meet the strong domestic demand during the festival season . 
Imports from Australia pick up during April and May after the harvesting season in that country . 
The domestic almond prices are a reflection of global supply - demand fundamentals , with the annual production at California being the most important price determining factor . 
The Indian traders keep a close track of the Californian crop progress with special focus kept on forecasts by US agencies , weather , pest attacks etc . 
The United States Department of Agriculture and the California Almond Board makes progressive assessment of crops , stocks , global supply and demand and releases regular reports , which are widely looked upon by the global market to determine prices . 
Domestically , stock present with traders and the cost at which it has been acquired is the most important price influencing factor . 
The major importers and traders of almond in India are well aware of the fundamentals of the domestic market requirements and are usually well - stocked to meet the annual festival demand . 
Meanwhile , as almond is not considered as an essential commodity and there is no local farming community producing this crop , policy intervention in this commodity is very minimal . 
Melted Menthol Flakes
Menthol flake is a transparent , white liquid with strong minty herbal odour derived from Mentha oil , which is obtained from a perennial herb called Mint ( Mentha arvensis ) belonging to the Labiatae family . 
This family is well known for aromatic plants , which yield volatile oils from the foliage . 
Mentha oil derived by steam distillation of mint ( pudina ) leaves is frozen to ( - ) 60o Celsius in an aluminum vessel for about a week . 
The liquid is then centrifuged to obtain De - Mentholised Oil ( DMO ) and Menthol flakes to the extent of 30 % and 70 % respectively . 
Menthol flakes are melted and packed in 180 kg galvanized iron barrel and Menthol flakes are further processed to obtain Menthol crystals . 
Menthol flakes and its constituents and derivatives are used in food , pharmaceutical , perfumery and flavoring industry . 
Its main constituent , menthol , is used in the manufacture of lozenges , toothpastes , pain balms , cold balms , Dabur Pudin Hara , etc . 
It is estimated that tobacco industry accounts for about 40 % of the total Mentha oil consumption followed by pharmacy and confectionary industry . 
Globally , India is the largest producer and exporter of Menthol Flakes . 
The other major producers in the world are China , Brazil , US and Japan . 
Out of total global production of Menthol flakes India contributes around 73 % , China 18 % and others 9 % . 
India meets the global demand by exporting nearly 10000 to 12000 tonnes per annum valued at more than Rs . 1000 crores . 
The major exports are directed to countries like China , France , Germany , Japan etc . 
About 50 % of total Menthol flakes production is exported to China , whereas menthol crystals are exported to US and European countries . 
India ' s annual production of Menthol flakes has been rising in the recent years to meet the rising demand , with 2007 and 2008 production estimated to be around 22 , 000 tonnes . 
However , production in 2009 is reported to have fallen to around 18 , 000 - 20 , 000 tonnes . 
Uttar Pradesh is India ' s largest producing state , contributing almost 80 - 90 % , to the country ' s total production , followed by Bihar , Punjab , Haryana and Himachal Pradesh . 
Cultivation of mint in India starts from February - March every year and the crop takes around 90 days to mature and produces first flowers , which is the best stage to harvest . 
First harvesting is done during May - June . 
Farmers undertake atleast two harvestings from the crop . 
Menthol flakes production in India begins from mid - June and steady arrivals are seen till November . 
The major production / trading centers of Menthol flakes cover the districts of Moradabad , Rampur , Barabanki , Sitapur and Lucknow in the Central Uttar Pradesh ; Chandigarh & Jalandhar in Punjab . 
The acreage under the crop , weather conditions during cultivation and India ' s output are very important factors influencing supply and prices as major share of global production and exports emanate from India . 
As India exports a significant portion of its annual production , any factor which affects global demand including macro - economic factors like economic scenario , currency fluctuations have a profound influence on domestic prices . 
The stock present with traders and the cost at which it has been acquired is a major price influencing factor . 
Domestic demand usually peaks during the winter season . 
Despite , supply not being a constraint in recent years due to successive bumper outputs , prices do display a tendency to firm during the winter months . 
The physical market of this commodity is very fragmented , does not have a regulatory body and is large consisting of around 500 participants including small processors , traders exporters and industrial users . 
The information flow is not uniform and accurate between different participants in many cases , which too is a factor to be kept considered , while pricing this commodity . 
Meanwhile , as Menthol flakes is not considered an essential commodity Government intervention in this commodity is very minimal . 
Mentha Oil
Mentha oil is obtained by steam distillation of Mentha arvensis leaves . 
Mentha oil and its constituents and derivatives are used in food , pharmaceutical and perfumery and flavouring industry . 
Menthol is the main constituent of mentha oil and slow cooling through refrigeration , crystallization , centrifugation and drying is done to obtain it . 
It is used in the manufacture of lozenges , toothpastes , pain balms , cold balms etc . 
Mentha is widely cultivated in India and its leaves are used in making sauces / chatni in most households . 
India is the largest producer and exporter of menthe oil in the world . 
At present the major producers of mint oil in the world are India , China , Brazil and the US . 
Mentha arvensis is cultivated in India in the semi - temperate regions in the foothills of Himalayas in Punjab , Haryana , Himachal Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh and Bihar . 
The all - India area under mentha in the country is estimated at about 1 , 25 , 000 hectares . 
India at present produces about 15 , 000 tonnes of mint oil and exports 3 , 000 tonnes which earns it foreign exchange worth Rs . 100 crores annually . 
India exports different types of mint oils to a number of countries including Argentina , Brazil , France , Germany , Japan , UK , USA , etc . 
These varieties include the Japanese mint oil ( derived from Mentha Arvensis ) , peppermint oil ( Mentha Piperita ) , dementholised Japanese mint oil , spear mint oil ( Mentha Spicata ) , water mint oil ( Mentha Aquatic ) , horsemint oil ( Mentha Sylvestries ) , Bergamont oil ( Mentha Citrate ) and still others . 
In the first 9months of 2002 - 03 , India ' s exports of mint oil were 3 , 000 tonnes valued at Rs . 102 . 95 crores against 2 , 850 tonnes valued at Rs . 97 , 91 crores in the same period in 2001 - 02
India cultivates about eight species of mentha however three species are approved / recognized by the purpose of quality standards and international marketing . 
The country ' s annual requirement of peppermint oil is about 10ton , which can be met by growing the crop , over 10 , 000 acres . 
The mint crop gives maximum oil content when it has just reached the flowering stage , after which the oil content begins to decline , but in cases where there is delayed flowering , as at Delhi , yellowing of the lower leaves is an indication for cutting in time . 2 - 3 cutting are done during the season . 
Freshly cut herb is left in the field for 2 - 4 hours during the sunny weather . 
This partially dried herb is further dried in small bundles by hanging over wires in shade till it is reduced to 1 / 3 or ¼ of its original weight , taking care that the leaves do not get crisp . 
The crop should not be heaped for drying in the sun as it is reported to result in reduction of oil by about 20 - 25 % . 
Distillation of dried leaves is cheaper than that of fresh leaves . 
By steam distillation and filtration , a golden yellow volatile oil is obtained . 
Leaves and flowering tops give the highest yield . 
About 50 % of menthol can be separated out in crystalline form on cooling the oil . 
The remaining ( dementholised ) oil is used as peppermint oil . 
Manufacture of menthol from dementholised oil has been taken up on commercial scale by three or four firms in Bombay , West Bengal and Gujarat . 
There are several small distilleries in U . P also for the distillation of oil . 
The peppermint oil is stored in coloured bottles , air - tight aluminium or galvanized containers in cool dry place . 
Presence of moisture in the oil may rancidify the oil . Since it is acidic in nature , it should not be stored in tin containers . 
The natural oil yields on an average 40 - 50 % menthol and 50 - 60 % dementholised oil , which can be used both in confectionery and medicine in place of imported peppermint oil . 
Japanese mint oil is not distinguished from the peppermint oil in the Indian trade . 
The dementholised oil has been found to contain menthyl acetate ( 29 . 4 % ) , free menthol ( 44 . 8 % ) , menthone ( 24 . 6 % ) and hydrocarbons ( 6 . 2 % ) . 
Among the hydrocarbons , alpha - pinene , a - 1 - limonene , carophyllene and cademene are present .

Potato is the world ' s fourth important food crop after wheat , rice and maize . 
Owing to its great yield potential and high nutritive value and accounts for nearly half of the worlds annual output of all root and tuber crops
Thus , with an annual global production of about 300 million tonnes , potato is an economically important staple crop in both developed and developing countries . 
India is ranked 5th in potato production after China , Russian Federation , Poland and Ukraine . 
However , potato productivity in India is merely 16 - 19 tonnes / ha vis - à - vis that of European countries and USA , i . e 30 - 40 tonnes / ha . 
The potatoes in India are cultivated under highly diversified agro - climatic conditions ranging from sea level to snowline and up to three crops are raised per year . 
Summer crop - March - April - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - August - September
Autumn crop - August - September - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - December - January
Spring crop - January - February - - - - - - - - - - - - - - May - June
Potato is mainly rabi crop and is grown mainly in UP , Punjab , Haryana , West Bengal , Madhya Pradesh , Bihar , Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu and Gujarat . 
During 2004 - 05 , 24 . 15million ton potato was produced in the country while production figure for 2003 - 04 is 23 . 27 million ton . 
Average acreage under potato varies between 12 to 15 lakh hectares depending on the weather condition during sowing period . 
Monthly Price Volatility
Monthly Variation in Potato Prices ( Jan . 2000 - June 2004 ) 
There are four - potato export zone in India viz . in UP , Punjab , MP and West Bengal . 
The major potato markets in UP are Agra , Hathras , Kanpur , Meerut , Farrukkhabad ; 
Jalandhar , Ludhiana , Phul and Patiala in Punjab ; Ujjain , Indore and Dewas in MP and Hoogly , Burdwan and Howrah in West Bengal
Variations in potato domestic acreage based on yield and price realization
Crop development based on weather progress in key growing regions particularly cold wave and heavy rains during tuber formation . 
Comparative price with other vegetables in the domestic market . 
Upcountry demand of potato from the major cities and food processing industries
The potato price tends to firm up during the planting period and eases down during the harvesting period . 
Transportation charges have also profound impact on prices
Potato growers and traders hoard the commodity before selling in expectation of better prices . 
Potato can be kept in cold storages without spoilage for 5 - 6 months . 
Natural Rubber ( NR ) is produced from latex or field coagulam obtained from rubber trees planted in plantations . 
The most important forms in which NR is processed and marketed are the following : 
Sheets , Crepes , Block rubber and Preserved Latex Concentrates . 
In India sheet rubber designated as RSS 1 , RSS 2 , RSS 3 , RSS 4 , RSS 5 are the most commonly produced and marketed . 
Block Rubber is designated in the grades of ISNR . 
Thailand , Indonesia , India , China , Malaysia , Vietnam are the major producers of rubber in the World . 
The global production fluctuates between 6 - 8 million tons , with a production of 7 . 9 million tons in 2003 , of which Asian countries have produced 6 . 76 million tons . 
On the consumption front , global NR consumption is 7 . 89 million tons in 2003 , of which 1 . 9 million ton was consumed in India and China alone . 
The total synthetic rubber consumption in 2003 was 1 . 13 million ton . 
Around 60 % of the global rubber production is used by the transportation sector . 
In this sector , natural or synthetic rubber cannot be used individually and has to be blended . 
Tokyo Commodity Exchange , Singapore Commodity Exchange , Osaka Mercantile Exchange are the major exchanges undertaking futures trading of rubbe . 
Kuala Lampur , London , New York are the major physical markets . 
India ' s rubber production in India is around 6 - 7 lakh tons . 
Kerala accounts for 90 % of India ' s rubber production . 
The other producer is Karnataka . 
RSS ( Ribbed Smoked Sheets ) account for 72 % of the production and 45 % of the imports . 
Block Rubber accounts for 10 % of the production and 40 % of the imports . 
The tyre industry , consumes 52 % of the almost 7 lakh rubber produced in the country . 
Tyre is the major form in which rubber is exported from India . 
India ' s tyre exports are around Rs . 1200 - 1300 crores a year . 
Duty - free imports against the advance licence scheme is permitted for re - export and rules mandate that only 44 kg of natural rubber can be imported against 100 kg of exports . 
India ' s imports vary between years and is currently around 50000 - 60000 tons a year . 
Duty - paid imports of natural rubber under open general license attract 20 % import duty . 
Kottayam , Kochi , Kozhikode and Kannur in Kerala are the major primary markets . 
Daily Price Volatility of RSS 4 Grade Rubber at Kottayam in 2002 - 2004
The rubber production fluctuates between months and it is normally low during the rainy season . 
Growth in industrial production : automobile industry . 
The ratio of utilization of domestic production and imported rubber by tyre manufacturers . 
Government policies have a profound influence on rubber prices . 
These include subsidies , restrictions on ports etc . 
International rubber price movements , have a slow influence . 
Stockists and speculators also play a significant role in influencing prices . 
Cardamom is known as the “Queen of Spices” . 
It is one of the most highly priced and exotic spices in the world . 
Coriander ( Coriandrum sativum ) , dhania is an annual spice crop and a member of the Umbelliferae , or carrot family . 
The coriander plant yields both the fresh herb and spice seed , which are used primarily for culinary purposes . 
The fresh green herb is called cilantro , or Chinese parsley . 
It is used in southeast and southern Asian , Chinese and Mexican cuisine , and for flavouring salads and soups . 
The fruits ( seeds ) are widely used as condiments with or without roasting in the preparation of curry powders , sausages and seasonings . 
It is an important ingredient in the manufacture of food flavourings , in bakery products , meat products , soda & syrups , puddings , candy preserves and liquors . 
The spice is also employed for the preparation of either the steam - distilled essential oil or the solvent - extracted oleoresin . 
Both products are used in the flavouring and aroma industries . 
The global production of coriander seed is estimated to be around 6 lakh tonnes . 
However , official estimates are rarely available for this crop in most producing countries . 
Additionally , coriander is widely grown in home gardens on a small scale , which is never included in official statistics . 
The major global producers are India , Morocco , Canada , Romania , Russia and Ukraine . 
The other producers are Iran , Turkey , Israel , Egypt , China , US , Argentina and Mexico . 
The global trade in coriander is estimated to be around 0 . 85 - 1 lakh tonnes a year . 
While , India , Turkey , Egypt , Romania , Morocco , Iran and China are the major exporters . 
Middle East , South - east Asia , USA , UK , Germany etc are the major importers . 
India is the biggest producer , consumer and exporter of coriander in the world with an annual production averaging around 3 lakh tonnes . 
The production fluctuates widely between years and has varied from below 2 lakh tonnes to above 4 lakh tonnes in this decade . 
Rajasthan ( 54 % ) and Madhya Pradesh ( 17 % ) are the two largest producing states in the country contributing over two - thirds to the country ' s total production in 2006 - 07 . 
The other producers are Gujarat ( 6 . 9 % ) , Assam ( 6 . 6 % ) , Andhra Pradesh ( 3 . 5 % , Karnataka ( 3 . 3 % ) , Orissa ( 3 . 2 % ) and Tamil Nadu ( 2 % ) . 
Official estimates of area and production are released by the Spices Board , India and the latest estimates available peg India ' s production in 2006 - 07 at 2 . 88 lakh tonnes and area under cultivation at 3 . 62 lakh hectares . 
The production from Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are reported at 1 . 55 and 0 . 50 lakh tonnes respectively . 
Rajasthan ' s coriander production is estimated to have dipped sharply to around 1 . 30 lakh tonnes in 2007 - 08 . 
However , output is 2008 - 09 is reported to be normal . 
Coriander for seed cultivation is grown as a rabi crop with sowing undertaken during October - November and new crop arrivals seen in February - March . 
India annually exports around 25 , 000 - 30 , 000 tonnes of coriander a year . 
India exported 30 , 200 tonnes of coriander in 2008 valued at Rs 204 crores in 2008 . 
The major buyers were Malaysia ( 7050 tonnes ) , UAE ( 5450 tonnes ) , Pakistan ( 3215 tonnes ) and Saudi Arabia ( 2475 tonnes ) . 
The major domestic buyers of coriander seed in India are spice processing agencies , which consume around 50 % of the production are mostly located in the southern states of India and Delhi . 
The demand from this sector peaks during April to June , which also coincides with the peak arrival period . 
The major markets are located in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh . 
The three largest markets are Kota , Ramganj Mandi and Baran in Rajasthan
The supply fluctuates sharply between season and this leads to high price volatility . 
The supply is influenced by acreage under the crop , weather and diseases . 
Weather , especially absence of frost during flowering and presence of sunshine during seeding stage plays a major role as it influences the yield and appearance of the seed . 
The crop is highly disease - prone and requires regular care and monitoring . 
The prices have been displaying only moderate seasonal behaviour in recent years with prices slightly dipping during the peak arrival months - March to June . 
The strong demand from domestic spice processors and export market has prevented prices from crashing even during the peak arrivals . 
The seeds can be stored for only around six - eight months in normal temperature and this influences availability and prices during the low availability months - October to January . 
Export demand is another important price influencing factor as India ' s surplus production is very limited . 
The exports from India have been picking up in recent years on account of the increased presence of Indians abroad and rising preference for spicy foods in developed nations .

Ministry of Micro , Small & Medium Enterprises
Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSME ) contribute nearly 8 percent of the country’s GDP , 45 percent of the manufacturing output and 40 percent of the exports . 
They provide the largest share of employment after agriculture . 
They are the nurseries for entrepreneurship and innovation . 
They are widely dispersed across the country and produce a diverse range of products and services to meet the needs of the local markets , the global market and the national and international value chains . 
The Ministry has a number of programmes to help and assist entrepreneurs and small businesses . 
If you are planning to set up business , you may contact National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development ( NIESBUD ) , National Institute for Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ( NI - MSME ) , Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship ( IIE ) or the Development Commissioner ( DCMSME ) for details about their programmes . 
If you are an existing entrepreneur and would like to improve your competitiveness , you may contact DC , MSME who can be of assistance in various ways . 
If you are wanting to set up a village industry or want to know more about Khadi or Coir Products , you may contact KVIC or Coir Board . 
Ministry of MSME encourages and honors innovation and enterprise and the State Governments , Industry Associations , Banks and other stakeholders through our numerous field offices and technical institutions to help the ‘engines of growth’ throughout the country . 
Coir Industry is an agro - based traditional industry , which originated in the state of Kerala and proliferated to the other coconut producing states like Tamil Nadu , Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Orissa , West Bengal , Maharashtra . 
Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSME ) sector has emerged as a highly vibrant and dynamic sector of the Indian economy over the last five decades . 
MSMEs not only play crucial role in providing large employment opportunities at comparatively lower capital cost than large industries but also help in industrialization of rural & backward areas , thereby , reducing regional imbalances , assuring more equitable distribution of national income and wealth . 
MSMEs are complementary to large industries as ancillary units and this sector contributes enormously to the socio - economic development of the country . 
Khadi is the proud legacy of our national freedom movement and the father of the nation . 
Khadi and Village Industries ( KVI ) are two national heritages of India . 
One of the most significant aspects of KVI in Indian economy is that it creates employment at a very low per capita investment . 
The KVI Sector not only serves the basic needs of processed goods of the vast rural sector of the country , but also provides sustainable employment to rural artisans . 
KVI today represent an exquisite , heritage product , which is ' ethnic ' as well as ethical . 
It has a potentially strong clientele among the middle and upper echelons of the society . 
Coir Industry is an agro - based traditional industry , which originated in the state of Kerala and proliferated to the other coconut producing states like Tamil Nadu , Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Orissa , West Bengal , Maharashtra , Assam , Tripura , etc . 
It is an export oriented industry and having greater potential to enhance exports by value addition through technological interventions and diversified products like Coir Geotextiles etc . The acceptability of Coir products has increased rapidly due to its ' environment friendly ' image . 
Ministry of Micro , Small & Medium Enterprises ( M / o MSME ) envision a vibrant MSME sector by promoting growth and development of the MSME Sector , including Khadi , Village and Coir Industries , in cooperation with concerned Ministries / Departments , State Governments and other Stakeholders , through providing support to existing enterprises and encouraging creation of new enterprises . 
The Micro ; Small and Medium Enterprises Development ( MSMED ) Act was notified in 2006 to address policy issues affecting MSMEs as well as the coverage and investment ceiling of the sector . 
The Act seeks to facilitate the development of these enterprises as also enhance their competitiveness . 
It provides the first - ever legal framework for recognition of the concept of " enterprise " which comprises both manufacturing and service entities . 
It defines medium enterprises for the first time and seeks to integrate the three tiers of these enterprises , namely , micro , small and medium . 
The Act also provides for a statutory consultative mechanism at the national level with balanced representation of all sections of stakeholders , particularly the three classes of enterprises ; and with a wide range of advisory functions . 
Establishment of specific funds for the promotion , development and enhancing competitiveness of these enterprises , notification of schemes / programmes for this purpose , progressive credit policies and practices , preference in Government procurements to products and services of the micro and small enterprises , more effective mechanisms for mitigating the problems of delayed payments to micro and small enterprises and assurance of a scheme for easing the closure of business by these enterprises are some of the other features of the Act . 
On 9 May 2007 , subsequent to an amendment of the Government of India ( Allocation of Business ) Rules , 1961 , erestwhile Ministry of Small Scale Industries and the Ministry of Agro and Rural Industries were merged to form the Ministry of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ( M / o MSME ) . 
This Ministry now designs policies and promotes / facilitates programmes , projects and schemes and monitors their implementation with a view to assisting MSMEs and help them to scale up . 
The primary responsibility of promotion and development of MSMEs is of the State Governments . 
However , the Government of India , supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various initiatives . 
The role of the M / o MSME and its organizations is to assist the States in their efforts to encourage entrepreneurship , employment and livelihood opportunities and enhance the competitiveness of MSMEs in the changed economic scenario . 
The schemes / programmes undertaken by the Ministry and its organizations seek to facilitate / provide :

In response to Business Standard Article : Rural Castles Built at Farmers’ Cost
Business Standard on 19 March , 2014 , carried a news item captioned “Rural Castles built at Farmers’ Cost” by Shri C . L . Dadhich . 
In this connection , we would like to present the factual position on NABARD ' s Rural Infrastructure Development Fund . 
The author’s argument that mandatory credit is diverted from farmers to State Governments on account of banks’ preference to RIDF deposits is both flawed and incorrect in view of the following : 
RIDF deposits are drawn from banks who have already defaulted in priority sector lending and not vice versa . 
Further , only investments in RIDF deposit do not count for priority sector lending . 
As per RBI guidelines on RIDF deposits , the interest paid on bank deposits varies from bank rate minus 2 % to bank rate minus 5 % depending upon the shortfall in priority sector lending which currently ranges from 7 % to 4 % ( gross ) , the author’s contention of RIDF deposit rates at 6 . 5 % is thus erroneous . 
The author has illogically compared the gross interest rates on RIDF deposits ( 6 . 5 % ) with net return on priority sector lending ( 4 . 5 % ) . 
If we consider the weighted average cost of deposits , the return from RIDF deposits would even be negative . 
Thus making it a disincentive to invest in RIDF deposits for the banks . 
RIDF corpus at 20 , 000 crore for the year 2013 - 14 constitutes only a minor portion ( 12 . 7 % ) as compared to the priority sector shortfall by public and private sector banks at 1 . 35 lakh crore and 0 . 22 lakh crore based on the data on priority sector lendings by banks as published in RBI Annual Report 2012 - 13 . 
RIDF loans have been utilised by State Governments for creating much needed capital formation in agriculture and critical rural infrastructure . 
The purposes ranged from irrigation and watershed development to rural connectivity and warehouses , apart from social infrastructure such as drinking water , schools and primary health . 
Since inception , an amount of 1 , 40 , 948 crore has been disbursed under RIDF creating 216 lakh ha of irrigation potential , 3 . 74 lakh km of rural roads and over 109 lakh regular rural employment . 
Impact evaluation studies by IIM , Bangalore , IIM , Lucknow , IIT – Roorkee , MITCON have reported significant improvement in cropping intensity , yield , income and improvement in living standards apart from significant improvement in credit flow by Commercial Banks / RRBs / Cooperative Banks in RIDF project areas . 
RIDF has actually enhanced the enabling environment for priority sector credit rather than depriving farmers of their share as argued by the author . It has led to capital formation in the agriculture sector and lead to verifiable , significant improvement in the rural economy of the project areas .

There is a need to provide comprehensive financial inclusion in spirit with the agenda of financial inclusion of the excluded population at the national level as per the framework described by the Report of the Committee on Financial Inclusion . 
Therefore , with the objective of ( a ) bringing about speedy financial inclusion with the best available technological interventions through greater coordination with other stakeholders and partner agencies ; 
( b ) wider coverage of clients ; 
( c ) pooling in of the positive experiences of three erstwhile departments , viz . Department of Core Banking Solutions ( DCBS ) , Special Projects Unit – KCC ( SPU - KCC ) and Financial Inclusion Department ( FID ) ; and
( d ) a unified referral point for ROs ; Department of Financial Inclusion & Banking Technology ( DFIBT ) has been set up with effect from 1st October 2014 by integrating the DCBS , SPU - KCC and FID . 
All the roles and functions performed by the erstwhile three departments have been taken over by DFIBT . 
The department has the following two verticals : 
Financial Inclusion
Banking Technology
FINANCIAL INCLUSION - Background : 
Indian economy in general and banking services in particular have made rapid strides in the recent past
However , a sizable section of the population , particularly the vulnerable groups , such as weaker sections and low income groups , continue to remain excluded from even the most basic opportunities and services provided by the financial sector . 
In order to address the issues of financial inclusion , the Government of India constituted a “Committee on Financial Inclusion” under the Chairmanship of Dr . C . Rangarajan . The Committee submitted its final report to Hon ' ble Union Finance Minister on 04 January 2008 . 
The Committee on Financial Inclusion has defined Financial Inclusion as " the process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low income groups at an affordable cost . ”
Among others , the Committee has recommended setting up of two funds - Financial Inclusion Fund ( FIF ) and Financial Inclusion Technology Fund ( FITF ) . 
The two funds have been established with NABARD , which is the coordinating agency of Financial Inclusion initiatives with Financial Inclusion Department ( FID ) as the nodal department . 
Prioritized activities / institutions for support from Financial Inclusion Fund ( FIF )

Support for establishing ATMs for weak Cooperative Banks / RRBs . 
ICT enabled Kisan Credit Cards ( KCC ) for both RRBs & Cooperatives . 
Onboarding of Aadhaar Enabled Payment Systems ( AEPS ) for RRBs / Cooperative Banks . 
Corpus and Sources of Funds
Based on the recommendations of the Interim Report of the Committee on Financial Inclusion , Government of India has constituted two funds viz . , Financial Inclusion Fund ( FIF ) for meeting the cost of developmental and promotional interventions of financial inclusion and Financial Inclusion Technology Fund ( FITF ) to meet the cost of technology adoption for financial inclusion . 
Each Fund consists of an overall corpus of 500 crore , with initial funding to be contributed by the GoI , Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development ( NABARD ) in a ratio of 40 : 40 : 20 . 
The funding was to be contributed in a phased manner over a maximum period of five years , depending upon utilisation of funds . 
However , the RBI has now decided , that the relative margin available to NABARD in excess of 0 . 5 % in respect of deposits placed by banks under RIDF and STCRC , will be credited to FIF w . e . f . 01 April 2012 and funds for FITF will be , by way of transfer from FIF . 
RBI and GoI have also decided that FIF and FITF may be managed with such margin and there will be no more contribution by them .

Core Banking Solution ( CBS ) to Co - operative Banks
In one of the biggest initiatives towards institution building , NABARD has facilitated the process of bringing the Co - operative Sector onto Core Banking Solution ( CBS ) platform . 
A total of 201 State and Central Co - operative Banks from 16 states & 03 UTs of the country , viz . Punjab , Haryana , Gujarat , Maharashtra , UP , Chhattisgarh , MP , Bihar , Karnataka , Tamil Nadu , Kerala , Uttarakhand , Sikkim , Himachal Pradesh , Jammu & Kashmir , Arunachal Pradesh , Chandigarh , Puducherry and Andaman & Nicobar joined the “NABARD initiated Project for CBS in Co - operatives” . 
Two vendors , viz . TCS and Wipro , have implemented the ambitious project across the country . 
As on 28th January 2015 , all the 201 banks with 6 , 953 branches under the NABARD project fully operating on CBS . 
This includes 122 new branches which were directly opened on CBS platform . 
Apart from the cooperative banks , Tamil Nadu Industrial Cooperative Bank ( TAICO ) has been taken onboard for roll - out of CBS under the project . 
The model followed in the initiative is Application Service Provider ( ASP ) model using the concept of cloud computing . 
The roll out process is in the final stage and branches are being migrated on CBS platform on a regular basis . 
Now these century old banks have started functioning in the CBS environment at par with the technological platform of the Commercial Banks and Regional Rural Banks and match up with these institutions in providing similar kind of services in the hinterland of the country . 
These banks now extend commensurate services to its existing and new clients keeping in sight the changing scenario and expectation level of the clientele . 
In time , their clients would be in a position to receive various Government incentives / subsidies and also other financial inputs directly in their accounts maintained with the co - operative banks . 
Bringing the Co - operative Banks under Core banking Solution would provide the following advantages : - 
Bring them at par with the technological platform of the Commercial Banks and also RRB and match up with these institutions in providing similar kind of services in the hinterland of the country . 
Transparency and regular reconciliation and balancing of books of account to arrest pilferage
Once the Banks are on a technology platform they will be in a position to utilise technological solution furthering the financial inclusion initiative in rural India . 
The customer of the Banks can avail facilities like Any Branch Banking , e - transfer of funds to anywhere in the country , etc
This will also enable GOI to transfer incentive / subsidy / other payments to the account holders based on Aadhaar number . 
Technological solution is expected to release staff members so that there will be more follow - up with the customers and also help bring in new customers / clients to the Banks thus improving the business portfolio . 
Special Project – RuPay Kisan Card
NABARD , in January , 2013 set up the Special Project Unit - Kisan Credit Card ( SPU - KCC ) with a mandate for encouraging cooperative banks and Regional Rural Banks across the country to issue Rupay KCC debit cards . 
The core objective of the unit is to facilitate issuance of cards by these banks through guidance , co - ordination with National Payment Corporation of India ( NPCI ) , interaction with sponsor banks of RRBs and cooperative banks . 
The overarching goal is to develop cashless ecosystem by enabling the farming community to avail all new banking facilities at par with urban area of the country . 
The SPU undertakes policy formulation , capacity building and networking with the various stake holders to achieve the above objectives . 
The new KCC guidelines specify that all KCC customers should have the facility of withdrawal through ATM / Debit cards . 
NABARD , with a view to facilitate early action in this direction , has already floated schemes providing financial support to RRBs and cooperative banks for issuing these cards . 
A total of 201 State and Central Co - operative Banks with 6 , 953 branches from 16 states & 03 UTs of the country , viz . Punjab , Haryana , Gujarat , Maharashtra , UP , Chhattisgarh , MP , Bihar , Karnataka , Tamil Nadu , Kerala , Uttarakhand , Sikkim , Himachal Pradesh , Jammu & Kashmir , Arunachal Pradesh , Chandigarh , Puducherry and Andaman & Nicobar joined the “NABARD initiated Project for CBS in Co - operatives” . 
All the 201 banks with 6 , 953 branches under NABARD - facilitated CBS Project are fully on CBS .

The Kisan Credit Card ( KCC ) has emerged as an innovative credit delivery mechanism to meet the production credit requirements of the farmers in a timely and hassle - free manner . 
As per the revised guidelines for KCC , the KCC should be a smart card cum debit card which could be used in the ATMs / Hand held Swipe Machines etc . 
RuPay is a new card payment scheme launched by the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) , has been conceived to fulfill RBI’s vision to offer a domestic , open - loop , multilateral system which will allow all Indian banks and financial institutions in India to participate in electronic payments . 
RuPay has come out with its RuPay KCC offering which leverages the benefits of both KCC and RuPay . 
Advantages of RuPay KCC : 
Unlike Visa and MasterCard networks , RuPay does not charge an entry fee . 
RuPay is well equipped to handle both the single message and dual messaging systems . 
RuPay is a PIN based product so it provides enhanced security . 
It offers complete web based architecture , so member banks will not have to develop a separate file based interface . 
RuPay provides advanced features such as processing of adjustment file to enable Tip and Surcharge processing on the SMS platform too . 
Administration costs & quarterly charges are very low when compared to current international schemes . 
Unlike normal KCC which serves only as an identity card and facilitate recording of transactions on an ongoing basis , RuPay KCC is actually a smart card that can be used at the nearest ATM / PoS for withdrawing cash . 
It removes the necessity of going to PACS or a bank branch to operate the account . 
SPU KCC during the last five months has engaged with RRBs and Cooperatives across the country , reviewing their readiness for providing RuPay KCC as ATM cum Debit cards . 
NABARD has been proactive in nature to support RuPay KCC . 
It has come out with guidelines for DCCBs and RRBs for implementing RuPay KCC , provides financial assistance to RRBs and DCCBs from its Financial Inclusion Fund ( FIF ) and Financial Inclusion Technology Fund ( FITF ) for demonstration & implementation of KCCs , ATMs / microATMs and PoS and even printing of cards . 
Steering Committee on KCC : 
A Steering Committee comprising senior representatives from NABARD , NPCI and major Sponsor Banks of RRBs has been constituted to give a push to the efforts of RRBs in issuance of ATM cum Debit cards to all operational KCC accounts . Six meetings have so far been conducted to discuss the issues and challenges faced by the RRBs and their Sponsor Banks
The Banks were guided for speeding up issuance of RuPay Kisan Cards . 
Guidelines regarding issue of KCCs in the form of interoperable RuPay Card by Central Cooperative Banks ( CCBs ) and Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs ) with assistance from FITF have been issued . 
Guidelines , specifically for cooperative banks , have also been issued for implementing payment systems with a brief outline on procedures to joiing National Financial Switch ( NFS ) , NEFT / RTGS etc . 
Handbook for providing card enabled services to RRBs and Cooperatives
There is a lack of awareness about new phrases and technology among those who have joined or are in the process of joining this new technology space only recently . 
This has also been observed in our interactions with the representatives of Regional Rural Banks and Cooperative banks . 
A need was therefore felt to bring together various common terms and systems involved in joining National Financial Switch ( NFS ) , RTGS and NEFT by these banks . 
Therefore , in this reference , the Handbook on providing card enabled services to RBBs and Cooperatives has been prepared by NABARD along with National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) to bring a single point reference to the various concerned stake holders in the rural banking sector .

Section 35 ( 6 ) of the Banking Regulation Act , 1949 , empowers NABARD to conduct inspection of State Cooperative Banks ( StCBs ) , Central Cooperative Banks ( CCBs ) and Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs ) . 
In addition , NABARD has also been conducting periodic inspections of state level cooperative institutions such as State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks ( SCARDBs ) , Apex Weavers Societies , Marketing Federations etc . , on a voluntary basis . 
Objectives of Supervision

To ensure that the business conducted by these banks is in conformity with the provisions of the relevant Acts / Rules , regulations / Bye - Laws . 
To ensure observance of rules , guidelines , etc . , formulated and issued by NABARD / RBI / Government . 
To examine the financial soundness of the banks .

Supervisory Process
On - Site Inspection
On site inspection of banks is carried out on a periodic basis . 
Besides the Head Office , certain regional / controlling offices and some branches are covered during inspection so as to ensure a minimum coverage of advances . 
The On - Site Inspection focuses on solvency , liquidity and operational health of the bank . While the compliance to the inspection findings is followed up in the usual course , NABARD addresses supervisory letters to the management of the banks , State Government , sponsor bank , etc . , highlighting the major areas of supervisory concern that need immediate rectification , holds supervisory discussions to draw up an action plan , that can be monitored . 
All the inspected banks are rated as per supervisory rating based on CAMELSC concept . 
Supplementary Appraisal
Supplementary Appraisal / Portfolio Studies are also undertaken by NABARD , wherever warranted . 
Off - Site Surveillance and Monitoring
As a part of the strategy of supervision , a system of ` Off - site Surveillance ' has been introduced as a supplementary tool to the on - site inspection . 
Its objectives are to obtain and analyse critical data on a continuous basis , to identify areas of supervisory concern and to issue early warning signals on risky areas requiring further action by banks . 
The system basically envisages desk scrutiny of operations of Cooperative Banks and RRBs through a set of statutory and non - statutory returns . 
While the periodical statutory on - site inspections attempt an overall evaluation of the performance of the banks within a stipulated period , off - site surveillance envisages continuous supervision , which will supplement the on - site inspections . 
Credit Monitoring Arrangements ( CMA ) 
The Credit Authorisation Scheme ( CAS ) for StCBs and DCCBs , which was in operation since 1974 , had been replaced by the Credit Monitoring Arrangement from April 2000 . 
Under CMA , cooperative banks are required to consider loan proposals for sanction within the broad framework of policy guidelines issued by RBI / NABARD from time to time and in accordance with the exposure and other prudent banking norms . 
Further , the cooperative banks would have to satisfy themselves about the technical feasibility and financial viability of the proposal , credit worthiness of the borrower , adequacy of margin , security , etc . 
However , NABARD would continue to review policies , issue instructions and convey approvals , where necessary , for financing Public Distribution System and other purchase / procurement operations of Central / State Governments as also deployment of surplus resources by StCBs / DCCBs . 
Board of Supervision ( for SCBs , DCCBs and RRBs )

Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs ) were established in 1975 under the provisions of the Ordinance promulgated on the 26th September 1975 and followed by Regional Rural Banks Act , 1976 with a view to develop the rural economy and to create a supplementary channel to the ' Cooperative Credit Structure ' with a view to enlarge institutional credit for the rural and agriculture sector . 
The Government of India , the concerned State Government and the bank , which had sponsored the RRB contributed to the share capital of RRBs in the proportion of 50 % , 15 % and 35 % , respectively . 
The area of operation of the RRBs is limited to notified few districts in a State . 
The RRBs mobilise deposits primarily from rural / semi - urban areas and provide loans and advances mostly to small and marginal farmers , agricultural labourers , rural artisans and other segments of priority sector . 
The RBI in 2001 constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr V S Vyas on “Flow of Credit to Agriculture and Related Activities from the Banking System” which examined relevance of RRBs in the rural credit system and the alternatives for making it viable . 
The consolidation process thus was initiated in the year 2005 as an off - shoot of Dr Vyas Committee Recommendations . First phase of amalgamation was initiated Sponsor Bank - wise within a State in 2005 and the second phase was across the Sponsor banks within a State in 2012 . 
The process was initiated with a view to provide better customer service by having better infrastructure , computerization , experienced work force , common publicity and marketing efforts etc . 
The amalgamated RRBs also benefit from larger area of operation , enhanced credit exposure limits for high value and diverse banking activities . 
As a result of amalgamation , number of the RRBs has been reduced from 196 to 64 as on 31 March 2013 . 
The number of branches of RRBs increased to 17856 as on 31 March 2013 covering 635 districts throughout the country .

Short and Medium Term Loans
Modern agriculture , as distinguished from traditional cultivation , involves substantial investment of recurring nature for using high yielding varieties of seeds , fertilisers , insecticides and costly agricultural implements . 
In such a situation , arrangements for credit should go much beyond the simple provision of credit and must be linked operationally with productivity and other services . 
Production and productivity , marketing and raising the level of surplus and savings must , therefore , be the major functions of credit . 
Besides , on the supply side , there must be an arrangement for assessing the requirements of funds on the basis of actual cost and raising the resources therefor . 
It was in this context , the crop loan system or the production oriented system of lending was evolved and concerived as the most appropriate mechanism for mass disbursement of production credit . 
Production Credit Department ( PCD ) deals with short term refinance facilities , for various types of production , marketing and procurement activities , being provided to client institutions , as detailed below : 
Short Term ( Seasonal Agricultural Operations ) 
Refinance is provided for production purposes at concessional rate of interest to State Cooperative Banks ( SCBs ) and Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs ) by way of sanction of credit limits .

Rural Housing
Housing in the rural areas , both agriculturist and non - agriculturists , combine the business as well as dwelling needs and thereby leads to overall rural development , NABARD is giving refinance ( investment credit ) to the eligible banks . 
Renewable Energy
While addressing India’s energy security challenges , Ministry of New and Renewable Energy ( MNRE ) , Government of India and the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission ( JNNSM ) . In order to achieve this objective , the MNRE has launched a capital cum interest subsidy scheme for creation of off - grid , decentralised solar powered energy harvesting devices through application of photo voltaic technology for the purpose of lighting , heating , etc . at the level of domestic and mini commercial applications . 
NABARD is the nodal agency for giving feasibility and Refinance for eligible projects . 
Food Processing Fund – 2014 - 15
Credit Facilities to Marketing Federations
To support Producers Organizations in carrying out business activities , NABARD has set Producer Organization Development Fund ( PODF ) during 2011 - 12 . 
The fund has supported Producers Organizations by extending credit + facilities to take up production , aggregations , processing and / or marketing activities . 
Since , most of the producer organizations are at nascent stage , their focus is mainly on production and to some extent the aggregation . 
These organizations are unable to take advantages of value addition , market linkage due to various limitations like scale of operations , absence of professional management , fragmented supply chain , poor market linkage , lack of storage and marketing infrastructure . 
Recognizing the importance of scientific storage and marketing infrastructure in improving the efficiency in agribusiness and supply chain management , NABARD is involved in supporting implementation of various projects / activities such as PACS as MSCs wherein the PACS have been recognized as potential partners to act as spoke under Hub and spoke model for developing warehouses and cold chains . 
Apart from this , funding of storage infrastructure under RIDF to State Govt . and through their warehousing corporations and marketing federations , implementing credit linked subsidy schemes for storage and marketing infrastructure of GOI . 
With the development of additional storage and marketing infrastructure by PACS , warehousing corporations and marketing federations / corporations / cooperatives , many State Marketing Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives have scaled up the marketing support to the farmers through PACS being primary aggregators at ground level . 
Till such time the producer organizations mature to handle the marketing activities efficiently on their own , they can be linked with the existing Marketing Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives by enrolling them as members / shareholders . 
The major limitation for expanding the marketing operations by these federations / corporations / Cooperatives is lack of timely and adequate credit support . 
In order to strengthen Marketing Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives in the marketing and other agriculture activities a separate line of credit , viz . ‘Credit Facilities to Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives’ has been made available for the Marketing Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives to promote the marketing of agriculture produce and other agriculture activities . 
The broad guidelines of Credit Facilities to Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives are as under :

Rural Infrastructure Development Fund ( RIDF ) was instituted in NABARD with an announcement in the Union Budget 1995 - 96 with the sole objective of giving low cost fund support to State Govts . and State Owned Corporations for quick completion of ongoing projects relating to medium and minor irrigation , soil conservation , watershed management and other forms of rural infrastructure . 
Dr . Manmohan Singh , the then Hon’ble Union Finance Minister , while announcing the establishment of the RIDF , in his budget speech on 15 March 1995 stated : 
Inadequacy of public investment in agriculture is today a matter of general concern . 
This is an area , which is the responsibility of States . 
But many States have neglected investment in infrastructure for agriculture . 
There are many rural infrastructure projects , which have been started but are lying incomplete for want of resources . 
They represent a major loss of potential income and employment to rural population . 
Direct Lending to Cooperative Banks
NABARD has traditionally provided refinance support to central cooperative banks ( CCBs ) through State Co - operative Banks ( SCBs ) . 
The implementation of revival package as per Vaidyanathan Committee recommendations has enabled CCBs to raise financial resources from sources other than the SCB . 
Accordingly , NABARD has designed a Short Term Multipurpose Credit Product for financing directly to CCBs . 
Sanction of Short Term Multipurpose Credit limits to CCBs - - Operational Guidelines
Cooperative banks have been long term business partners of NABARD and are an integral part of the rural financial system . 
The cooperative banks not only cater to the credit needs but also provide other financial services to a majority of farmers , especially small and marginal farmers and weaker sections of society . 
The implementation of GoI Revival Package for STCCS as per Vaidyanathan Committee recommendations has enabled CCBs to borrow funds directly from any financial institution regulated / approved by RBI . 
The CCBs have also been given autonomy to diversify their loan business in order to increase profitability and achieve viability on a sustainable basis . 
Accordingly , a Short Term Multipurpose Credit Product’ has been developed and the limits are sanctioned to eligible CCBs under Section 21 ( 1 ) ( i ) to ( v ) read with Section 21 ( 2 ) of the NABARD Act , 1981 . 
Purposes covered
The credit limits will be sanctioned to CCBs for lending to individuals ( such as farmers , traders , artisans etc ) through their branches and through PACS for variety of purposes such as : 
Working Capital requirements
Repair and maintenance of farm equipment and other productive assets
Storage / grading / packaging of produce
Marketing activities
Crop loan ( if the requirement is more than 3 . 0 lakh ) 
Redemption of old debts and other socio - economic needs
In addition to the above , all purposes which are covered under section 21 ( 1 ) ( i ) to ( v ) NABARD Act , 1981 , is also eligible for refinancing under this product . 
Eligibility Norms for CCBs
The credit limit will be sanctioned to well governed and financially strong ‘A’ & ‘B’ categories of CCBs as per the latest inspection report of NABARD and the bank should have been licensed by RBI . 
Operative period & nature of limit
The credit limit sanctioned will be operative for a period of one year from the date of sanction of the limit
However , loans disbursed by the CCB prior to the date of sanction of the limit by NABARD can also be considered for refinance , provided , the loan is disbursed in the same financial year i . e . 01 April & onwards and is “non - overdue . 
The credit limit sanctioned will be in the nature of cash credit accommodation and the CCB may draw and repay as many times as required , provided the loan outstanding in the account does not exceed the credit limit sanctioned . 
The limit can be considered for renewal after completion of one year provided the account has been operated satisfactory and the CCB meets the eligibility criteria and other requirements as per the scheme . 
Quantum of credit limit
The credit limit will be sanctioned to eligible CCBs to the extent of 100 % of their lending programme after due diligence . 
While sanctioning the loan limit to the CCB , the financial position of the CCB , trend and growth rates , potential available for the loan products in the district , absorption capacity of the CCB etc will be taken in to account while sanctioning the credit limit . 
Rate of Interest
HO would decide the rate of interest on refinance to this product from time to time . 
The interest is payable at quarterly rests . 
In the event of default by CCB in repayment of loans or any part thereof and / or in the event of default in payment of interest or any portion thereof on due dates , an additional interest of 2 % over and above the interest rate at which the limit has been sanctioned will be charged for the period during which the default persists . 
Risk appraisal & Rating of CCB
The appraisal of the CCB will be carried out in the following areas : 
Financial appraisal of the CCB –
Each item of the Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss account of the CCB for the last 3 years should be analysed to observe trends and any issues that may be of concern . 
Credit risk assessment of the CCB - 
A credit risk rating tool , based on CAMELSC and other relevant parameters has been specifically designed to assess the credit risk of CCBs . 
The risk rating would be carried out on the basis of NABARD’s inspection report ( IR ) which should not be more than 15 months old . If the IR is more than 15 months old , then the rating should be carried out on the basis of latest audited financial statements and audit report of the bank . Based on the score obtained from the risk rating tool , the rating category is assigned to the bank . 
Security Norms
The CCB shall pledge unencumbered fixed deposit receipts ( FDRs ) issued by Scheduled Banks as security to the loan . 
At present , the quantum of FDRs to be pledged to NABARD is determined as per the table given below : 
Rating score : 81 % & above
CRAR : 9 % & above
Gross NPA level : Less than 5 % 
Pledge of FDRs to the extent of 50 % of limit sanctioned . 
Rating score : 76 % & above
CRAR : 7 % to 9 % 
Gross NPA level : 5 % to 7 % 
Pledge of FDRs to the extent of 60 % of limit sanctioned
Rating score : 60 % & above
CRAR : 5 % to 7 % 
Gross NPA level : less than 8 % 
Pledge of FDRs to the extent of 75 % of limit sanctioned
All three parameters , viz . , score obtained from the risk rating tool , CRAR and Gross NPAs have to be read together and in case any one of the parameters do not qualify in that particular grade , it will go one grade below . 
The quantum of security prescribed in the above matrix is minimum . 
NABARD has liberty to demand additional quantum of security , if need be , irrespective of the minimum security prescribed in the above table . 
It is possible that the CCB concerned may not be in a position to provide the fixed deposit receipts covering the entire sanctioned amount at the time of first drawal from the account , therefore . 
ROs may permit drawals provided the prorata fixed deposit receipts pledged covers the amount to be drawn under the sanction . 
In other words , ROs should ensure that the outstanding loan amount is always covered by securities taken on prorata basis . 
Inspection of books of accounts
NABARD reserves the right to inspect / arrange to inspect the books of accounts of the bank as part of the lending agreement . 
Special Audit
NABARD would have the right to cause special audit of the books of accounts and other relevant material of the CCBs either by itself or through other agencies to ensure that the same are maintained as per the rules and regulations in force and the terms and conditions of refinance are adhered to by the bank . 
Direct Lending to Cooperative Banks – Working Capital Loans to SCBs / CCBs against Pledge limits to Cooperative and Private Sugar factories
NABARD has been traditionally providing refinance assistance to SCBs on behalf mof CCBs for various Short term credit activities under its Short Term Credit policy . 
It has been observed that SCBs / CCBs have availed refinance from NABARD mostly for seasonal agricultural operations and other short term credit requirements are met mainly from their own resources . 
In order to unlock the funds of SCBs / CCBs and enable them to make prompt payments to farmers towards procurement of sugarcane , it has been decided to provide refinance assistance to SCBs / CCBs against pledge limits sanctioned to cooperative and private sugar factories . 
Accordingly , a short term credit product for CCBs / SCBs for sanction of pledge limits to cooperative and private sugar factories has been developed . The features of the credit product are given as under :

NABARD has taken an initiative for supporting producer organizations , adopting a flexible approach to meet the needs of producers . In order to give a special focus , the “Producers Organization Development Fund” ( PODF ) has been set up wef 01 April 2011 , with an initial corpus of 50 crore . 
Any registered Producers Organization viz , Producers Company ( as defined under Sec 581 A in part IXA of Company’s Act 1956 ) , Producers Cooperatives , registered Farmer Federations , MACS ( Mutually aided cooperative society ) , industrial cooperative societies , other registered federations , PACS , etc . set up by producers are eligible under the fund . Support under PODF is provided as under : 
Credit Support is provided for financial intervention . 
Support in the form of grant , loans , or a combination of these is also available for capacity building & market interventions . 
Since most of the Producers Organisations are having low capital base , scope for NABARD ' s intervention under PODF has been enhanced to support Producers Organisations for contribution to share capital . 
Indian producers are unable to realize optimal value from their produce and progress further due to fragmentation of land holdings and lack of organization . 
India has over 12 . 5 crore farmer households of which over 85 % are small and marginal farmers with land holdings of less than 2 hectares . 
The average size of land holding is 1 . 33 hectare / farmer household . 
Due to this fragmentation and disorganization , it is not economically viable for the farmers not only to adopt latest technology but also to use high yielding varieties of inputs like seeds and fertilizers . 
They are also unable to realize good value from their marketable surplus by individually selling their produce . 
On the other hand in case of non - farm sector activities , the handloom weavers & artisans are not able to compete with their products in the market due to poor quality & obsolete designs . 
Through better organization , producers can utilize scale to procure inputs at a lower price , and gain more selling power for their produce / product . 
Forming a producer organization can also provide access to timely and adequate finance , build capacity and provide linkages to markets . 
NABARD has , therefore , decided to set up a separate fund titled " Producers Organization Development Fund " ( PODF ) to tackle the issues of non availability of timely credit , capacity building of producers & strengthening of the Producers Organizations and market tie - ups . 
The Fund has been created in NABARD with an initial corpus of 50 crores from out of its operating surplus for the year 2010 - 11 . 
Title and Commencement
A separate Fund titled “Producers Organization Development Fund ( PODF ) ” has been created with an initial corpus of 50 crore with a sanctioning limit of 100 crore out of NABARD’s profits as at the end of the financial year 2010 - 11 and it will be operational with effect from 1st April 2011 . 
Producers Organization – Definition

It is formed by a group of producers for either farm or non - farm activities
It is a registered body , and a legal entity
Producers are shareholders in the organization
It deals with business activities related to the primary produce / product
It works for the benefit of the member producers
Portions of profit are shared amongst the producers and the balance goes to the share capital or reserves . 
Objectives of the Fund
Producers Organization Development Fund ( PODF ) will be used to support Producers Organizations across three levers , viz . credit support , capacity building & market linkage .

Producers Organization would be eligible for the following types of loans : 
Direct lending to Producers Organization for term loans or
Composite loans comprising of both working capital and term loan requirements , or
Working Capital as composite loan
Subordinated Debt as tier II capital based on the requirements of the PO and provided the Memorandum and Articles of Association / byelaws permit them to accept such a debt . 
Capacity Building
Capacity building should broadly cover any activity relating to functioning of a producer organization . Broadly the various types of capacity building initiatives which can be supported under the fund are as follows : 
Skill development in order to enable the members produce goods both in farm and non - farm sector , 
Business planning
Technological extension through classroom training , 
Exposure visits , agricultural university tie ups , expert meetings , etc . 
Any other capacity building initiative which directly benefits the P . O . 
Support for capacity building could be in the form of grant , loans , or a combination of the two based on the need of the situation . Capacity building support will not be given in isolation in general . It would essentially be a part of the overall project having loan component . 
Market Linkages
Credit and / or grant support for setting up of marketing infrastructure facilities for sale of produce . 
Support could even be in the lines of rural haat and rural mart if the situation so desires or it could be structured differently based on the need . 
NABARD will explore tie ups with buyers for Producers Organization ' s produce . 
NABARD shall help form partnerships between Producers Organizations and local and large companies . 
Through existing schemes of MoRD and NHM , NABARD will promote creation of infrastructure wherever possible . 
The overall grant inclusive of all components would not exceed 20 % of the loan amount . 
Other Area
Other than the three broad categories stated above , support would be available for
Support for preparation of DPR up to 0 . 5 % of the project cost or 1 lakh whichever is lower . 
This support will be given subject to the fact that the project is sanctioned by NABARD . 
The grant amount would be within the overall cap of 20 % stated above . 
Exclusive grant support for taking forward SHGs / farmers’ clubs / producer groups to the stage of having a Producers Organization . Separate scheme would be formulated for this purpose when need arises for such a support . 
Any other support felt necessary for enabling a Producers Organization function in a better and profitable manner subject to the recommendation of ED Committee and with the approval of Chairman / MD . 
Eligible Institutions
The following institutions will be eligible for assistance from PODF : 
Loan Component : Loans will be given to Registered Producers Organizations under any statute of law . 
Grant Component : It would be a part of the overall project . 
However , money can be given to either the registered PO or the implementing agency or both depending on the situation . 
The PO has to be a Registered Producers Organization under any Statute of Law . 
Others could be : 
Non - Government Organisations , registered Community Based Organisations ( CBOs ) providing different support services to Agricultural and allied sector activities / Non Farm Sector activities . 
Other institutions / organisations whose objectives / activities are in conformity with the overall objectives of PODF and are approved by NABARD in this regard . 
Selection Criteria
Producers Organization
ROs may ensure that the Producers Organization is registered and is working for the benefit of the producer members .

NABARD Infrastructure Development Assistance ( NIDA ) 
NIDA is a new line of credit support for funding rural infrastructure projects . 
NIDA is designed to fund State owned institutions / corporations on both on - budget as well as off - budget for creation of rural infrastructure outside the ambit of RIDF borrowing . 
The assistance under NIDA is available on flexible interest terms with longer repayment period upto 15 years ( 2 - 4 years repayment holiday ) . 
Objectives of the NIDA Programme
NABARD is deeply committed to rural development , and infrastructure is an integral part of this development . 
Traditionally , NABARD has been closely working with State Governments through RIDF to fund various infrastructure initiatives . 
However , this channel for creation of rural infrastructure faces certain issues : 
Borrowing power of State Governments is limited under Article 293 , thus limiting the off - take of RIDF
Prioritizing infrastructure to be created through RIDF funds is often dictated by the political environment
In the course of multiple interactions with State Governments , it was understood that State Governments would like a wider range of financial products to support creation of rural infrastructure . 
In addition , State Governments are looking for avenues to borrow off - budget ( eg . through corporations ) to avoid exceeding their borrowing power limits . 
Based upon this , the NABARD Infrastructure Development Assistance programme was designed for State Governments and other state - owned organizations . 
NIDA aims to fund rural infrastructure creation by providing assistance to state governments , outside of RIDF borrowing , and other state - owned organizations ( eg . Corporations ) , through direct financing based upon risk appraisal of the specific project . 
Overview of the NIDA offering
The following are the key features of the current NIDA credit offering . 
The unique feature of NIDA is that the terms will be customized as per the borrower’s requirements , based upon the project and borrower’s risk profile . 
Key feature
Type of loan : Term loan
Tenure : Long term , upto 15 years
Interest rate : Will vary based upon project and risk profile of borrower . 
Interest rates will be linked to NABARD’s market borrowings . As of now , NIDA products offer fixed interest rate over the tenure of the loan . 
However this can be reviewed in future
Moratorium : Based upon the specific project and borrower , moratorium of upto 2to 4 years can be considered
Security : Appropriate security will have to be provided by borrower , based upon risk profile and nature of project . 
State Govt . guarantee is not mandatory , but can be requested based upon the risk profile and nature of project
Repayment : Repayment schedule can be designed based upon borrower’s requirements , nature of project and risk profile . Eg . based upon borrower’s cash flows , a ballooning repayment schedule can be designed , with the greater share of principle repayment structured towards the later tenure of the loan
The NIDA credit offering can be further refined , and additional products ( eg . annuity based products , mezzanine capital , PPP etc . ) Can be structured based upon borrower requirements and market demand . 
In addition , NIDA also aims to leverage NABARD’s existing development schemes as well as technical expertise by offering Credit + support to infrastructure projects . 
The following areas have been identified as potential credit + support that can be offered with NIDA projects . The aim is to offer credit + support for a fee , in order to ensure it is a sustainable venture for NABARD . 
Project evaluation and monitoring : 
NABARD can support the borrower from the initial stages of DPR ( Detailed Project Report ) preparation , to monitoring of the progress of the project to ensure efficient use of funds for infrastructure creation . 
Going ahead , appropriate IT tools may be developed ( similar to World Bank , Andhra Pradesh govt’s project monitoring tools ) to monitor progress of infrastructure creation
Technical advisory support : 
NABARD can provide technical advisory support to the borrower , through internal expertise as well as NABCONS . 
The technical advisory support can help borrowers in designing the project , as well as ensuring successful operationalization of the project . 
Linkage with existing development schemes : 
NABARD has a host of development schemes that can be offered , as per the requirements of the infrastructure project . 
The aim of offering these schemes would be to enhance the utility of the infrastructure . Eg . POs and Farmer Clubs can be created in the area where warehouse is being constructed , and encouraged to utilize the new warehouse . 
Submission of Detailed Project Report ( DPR ) 
The Detailed Project Report ( DPR ) is the starting document required to be submitted by the borrower . 
Most DPRs received for RIDF projects focus on technical details of project only . 
Under NIDA , it will be critical to also have a detailed business plan that indicates the financial viability of the project and borrower . 
In addition , multiple other documents are required to support the DPR
A typical DPR should contain
Details of the borrower , including company background , shareholding pattern , existing bankers etc .

Financing and Developing PACS into multi - service centres
PACS being the registered cooperative society has been providing credit and other services to its members . 
It has been observed that PACS are generally meeting out the credit requirements of its members . 
However there is a need to provide other services to the farmers and hence PACS should be developed as a unit to meet all their needs . 
To ensure better returns on the agricultural produce , the farmers should not only be encouraged to use the latest technology to increase agricultural production but also to store their produce in a scientific way to minimise storage losses and provide pledge loan to bridge credit gap . 
In order to enable PACS to provide more services to their members and generate income for themselves , an initiative has been taken to develop PACS as multi service centres . 
This will enable PACS to provide ancillary services to its members and diversify its activities . 
Assistance under PODF is available to SCB / CCB / PACS for this purpose . 
PACS , being the registered cooperative society , has been providing credit and other services to its members . 
PACS are generally providing the following facilities to the members : 
Input facilities in form of cash or kind component to members . 
Agriculture implements on hiring basis . 
Storage facility . 
Some of the PACS are also assisting farmers in marketing of their produce . 
However there is a need to provide other services to the farmers . 
The PACS should be developed as a unit for meeting all the needs of the farmers . 
To ensure better returns on the agriculture produce , the farmers should not only be encouraged to use the latest technology to increase agriculture production but also to store their produce in a scientific way to minimise the storage losses and provide pledge loan to bridge credit gap . 
With the decrease in per capita landholding size over a period of time , it is not economical for the farmers to purchase the farm equipments . 
Moreover many new inventions have come in the recent years in the agriculture sector which needs to be brought to the farms . 
The use of the new technology & HYV will increase the productivity of the produce . 
It has also been observed that most of the farmers go in for distress sale of the produce as they are in the need of immediate credit . 
Further adequate storage capacity is not available in the rural area where even the small farmers can store their produce and avail pledge loan . 
PACS can play an important role in providing these facilities to the farmers . 
To increase the business portfolio of PACS so as to make it a self sustainable entity , it is essential that the PACS should provide additional services like providing agriculture implements on hiring basis , enabling collective purchase of inputs , having good quality storage capacity as per Negotiable Warehouse Receipt System , etc . 
Accordingly , the following facilities can be taken up by PACS to the farmers : 
Agro - Storage centre : 
Upgradation of the existing storage facility or construction of new godown along with sorting / grading unit as per Negotiable Warehouse Receipt System . 
This will enable them to issue warehouse receipts . 
Based on these receipts , the farmers can get loan against the crop stored and can cultivate the next crop . 
Thus the farmers will be facilitated to get better price by holding the crops without affecting the fund flow position . 
Agro - service Centre : 
Purchase of hi - tech agri - implements like power tiller , land leveller , rotary slasher , movers , seed driller , multi crop planter , paddy transplanter , sprayers , combine harvester etc . depending upon the requirements of members . 
The earning will be from the rental of these equipments . 
Agro - processing centre : 
Primary Processing : Sorting , grading unit , waxing / polishing unit , pre - cooling chambers , etc
Secondary Processing : Value addition to produce e . g . Mini rice mill , atta chaki , horticulture produce processing etc . 
Agri - information centre : 
Testing lab for soil & water , creating panel of experts for providing services on payment basis , knowledge dissemination centre , arrange training to farmers . 
The testing lab & expert guidance will be available to farmers at a cost . 
Agri Transportation & Marketing Facilities : 
Procurement of produce , Direct market linkage after aggregation and / or processing , setting up of rural mart etc
The PACS , which are either in the area of marketing or intend to undertake this activity , may create this channel to facilitate the farmers in marketing . 
Availability of Funds : 
Loan under PODF : 
NABARD will also support some of the PACS identified by the committee under PODF . 
Eligibility : PACS being a registered society having the membership of the farmers is eligible to be assisted under the fund . Under PODF , loan can be given for the above activities
Since the PACS are already an existing legal entity , the requirement of the grant support is not to the extent as in case of Producers Organisations . 
However , to facilitate PACS in taking up these activities for the benefit of the farmers , need based grant support will be available to PACS which should not be utilised towards the capital cost of the project . 
In any case the grant should not exceed 10 % of the loan component . 
Interest free or low interest loan can also be considered in lieu of grant . 
The following activities can be supported under the grant / interest free loan / low interest loan component : 
Knowledge dissemination centre
Training to farmers
Initial administrative cost to start new business activities
Margin by PACS : 
Minimum 10 % of the project cost . 
However in case of rural godown the margin will be as per the scheme , in case the subsidy is claimed by PACS . 
As on now NABARD is not one of the eligible institution to claim subsidy under Grameen Bhandaran Yojana . 
Interest Rate : The interest rate under PODF is fixed by ALCO . 
Repayment : The repayment will be maximum 9 years including grace period of two years . 
Loan through CCB or RRB : 
To facilitate PACS to avail subsidy under Grameen Bhandaran Yojana , loan from PODF can be sanctioned to CCB on getting specific projects from PACS in its area of operation . 
The project of each PACS will be evaluated by RO and recommended to HO , where the ROs have not been delegated the sanctioning power . 
Since CCB will be taking the loan from NABARD for on lending to PACS , CCB may charge maximum additional 1 % interest over and above the interest rate charged by NABARD . 
For example , if the loan is sanctioned to CCB @ 10 % , CCB should not charge more than 11 % from PACS . 
Loan can be routed through RRB ( where DCCB is not in good health ) . Other terms & conditions will remain the same as per PODF guidelines . 
In case of loans routed through DCCBs / RRBs , NABARD will continue to be involved in identifying PACS , appraising proposals and monitor project implementation and loan recovery . 
However , this should not make the DCCBs / RRBs feel at any point of time that they are just a pass through agency . 
Loan from CCB / RRB or from own sources : 
PACS can either use their own sources or avail credit facilities from CCB & RRB . 
In such a case , the grant support from PODF is not available . 
DCCB or RRB can avail of refinance facilities as per the usual terms & conditions . 
Regional Office will keep a track of the facilities being developed at PACS level and monitor the same at regular interval . 
In cases where loan is from the DCCB or RRB , or own resources are being used and financial support from NABARD is not being taken , NABARD would guide in project formulation , if necessary , so as to enable best utilisation of funds
Umbrella Programme for Natural Resource Management
NABARD has been implementing Natural Resource Management projects ( Watershed Development and Wadi Development Programmes ) for the past 20 years under Indo - German collaboration with support from KfW and GIZ . 
The long standing development cooperation between NABARD and German Development Corporation ( GDC ) has been a key contributor in NABARD emerging as an innovator in the natural resource management , influencing policy at national level and improving lives at grass root level . 
In order to further upscale and integrate NABARD’s existing and future Indo - German NRM efforts into one streamlined approach of participatory NRM related interventions , NABARD and GDC has launched the Umbrella Programme on Natural Resources Management ( UPNRM ) . 
The UPNRM integrates NABARD’s existing and future Indo - German NRM efforts into one streamlined approach of participatory NRM related interventions . 
The programme objective is to contribute to mainstreaming of holistic , participatory and financially sustainable livelihood solutions into public NRM policies and financial instruments for improving the livelihoods of the rural poor based on the sustainable natural resource use and management . 
The programme aims at funding community managed sustainable NRM based rural livelihood projects . 
UPNRM is following a programme based approach wherein different channel partners ( agencies ) are being supported for implementing various types of sustainable NRM projects conforming to the flexible programming mechanism on agreed policies and guiding principles of the strategic partners . 
The projects proposed under UPNRM will have to pass through a scrutiny at Guiding Principles level of the programme . 
These principles entail that the projects have to be pro - poor designed on integrated & need based approach , should ensure sustainability , involve community participation and be based on sound and transparent Governance . 
The programme envisages a gradual shift from grant based to loan based NRM projects and funding will be through a corpus comprising Financial Cooperation from KfW as well as fund mobilized by NABARD from various sources . 
The interest rate applicable for projects under UPNRM will depend on the nature of project , channel partners and the target groups . 
Rationale for an NRM Policy : 
Despite India’s recent high economic growth rate , around 350 million out of its more than one billion strong population is still living below one dollar a day . 
Seventy - five percent ( 262 million ) of India’s poor are living in rural areas , primarily dependent on agriculture and natural resources for their subsistence . 
Acknowledging the rural distress , the Indian Government has declared the development of rural areas a top national priority ( National Common Minimum Programme of the GoI , 2004 ) . 
The most critical elements here are the access to and equitable management of local resources in a viable and sustainable way . 
Although there are several instances of increased policy direction towards greater investment for sustainable management of natural resources from the state and private channels , the policy governing sustainable management for rural livelihoods has not been well defined . 
Hence , it is imperative that a clearly defined NRM sector policy is evolved to give a focused and coordinated attention for management of natural resources for enhanced livelihood for the rural people on a sustainable basis . 
Three Key Challenges : 
With expansion of the public programme for natural resources management ( NRM ) , new challenges are emerging . 
India will find it difficult to provide the huge resources ( over € 13 billion up to 2022 ) needed to achieve the projected target for NRM programmes . 
The Planning Commission Working Group has emphasized to gradually move out of the culture of grants and subsidies by increasing people’s contribution up to 50 % of the costs by 2017 . 
This would require development of new models and programmes for financing and managing watershed development . Currently , there are three key challenges faced by NRM sector in India ; 
Development of a suitable policy environment that promotes increased appreciation and investments for NRM activities . 
UPNRM Guiding Principles
The UPNRM initiative provides the possibility for NABARD to further develop expertise in NRM issues in the country and become a thematic leader . 
In light of this , the key policy goal of UPNRM is “Supporting sustainable NRM focused initiatives to improve the livelihoods of the socially marginalized / disadvantaged groups ( including poor , women , tribals ) ” . 
In addition , as a policy , UPNRM will promote projects that are implemented employing innovative methodologies and approaches which could be mainstreamed into the traditional NRM approach and projects that have a scope for wider replicability . 
In this context , the programme would be guided by the following overarching principles : 
Pro - poor : 
The programme recognises the need to address socio - economic disparities through ensuring equitable access to environmental resources and quality for all sections of society , particularly the poor and the disadvantaged who are most dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods . 
Ensuring Sustainability : 
The programme emphasises the importance of integration of environmental concerns as essential means for accelerating and sustaining development and human well - being . 
Community participation : 
Empowerment of local communities and their voluntary participation in project design , implementation and monitoring for the appropriate use of natural resources for equitable and sustainable development . 
Good Governance : 
Effective project implementation depends directly on strengthening decentralized governance to ensure participation of rural poor and other disadvantaged groups in local decision - making and achieving equity in ownership , access and use of resources in a transparent and responsible manner . 
The resource management projects should subscribe to the “Subsidiarity” principle to guide the division of decision - making , rule - making , implementation , enforcement and dispute - resolution powers to the lowest possible level . 
Integrated and needs - based approach : 
An integrated approach merges various disciplinary perspectives as well as achieves convergence with existing initiatives to facilitate the development of appropriate technologies / products / approaches that are responsive to the needs of the local community . 
This requires the programme design to be context sensitive and flexible . 
An appraisal matrix for evaluating NRM Projects at “Guiding Principles” level is given hereunder
Guiding Principles Criteria
Pro - poor : Benefits may be measured in terms of : 
Improves short and long - term employment opportunities . 
Reduces indebtedness

Community participation
Ownership
Empowerment
The project discourages community participation
Only one way flow of information from IA to members of the local community on the project activities . 
The project has no provision for community participation . 
Participation of people is through the process of consultations where they define both problems and solutions . 
Community participates in planning and implementation of project interventions through appropriate institutional structures and systems
Good Governance
Equity in ownership , access and use of resources

The project objectives are detrimental to the interests of the local community
The project takes a sectoral approach with a fixed menu of activities to be undertaken . 
The project provides for multi - sectoral interventions for improving livelihoods / agro - ecosystem resilience / productivity / environmental services based on identified needs , issues , constraints and opportunities . 
Decision parameter : 
A project should attain a score of at least + 1 against each guiding principle and an overall score of + 5 to qualify for funding under UPNRM . 
Projects that do not attain these minimum scores will not pass through to next stage of appraisal . 
Core / priority areas : comprising
Soil and water conservation ( including watershed programmes , dry land farming systems ) 
Plantation and horticulture ( tree based farming , Bamboo based farming , wadi development , organic farming , energy plantations ) 
Forestry activities ( rehabilitation and management / Community Forest management , biodiversity conservation ) 
Farming systems management ( including livestock and aquaculture resources ) 
Climate change adaptation / Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) 
Supplementary / support areas
Including forward and backward linkages and livelihood generating activities : 
Processing , storage , marketing , 
Critical rural infrastructure ( including rural roads , minor irrigation , drinking ( water ) 
Renewable energy ( micro / mini - hydel , biomass based power generation , bio fuels , wind - power , solar power ) 
Livelihood generating activities ( dairy , poultry , fisheries , etc ) 
Micro - finance
Any other activity which supports the efficient implementation of the projects covering the core areas and thereby intensifying their impact . 
Information & Knowledge Management ( IKM ) and Capacity Building : 
Necessary enablers such as capacity building , project preparation , planning , infrastructure , Information & Knowledge Management systems , etc . would be covered under the NRM sector
It is mentioned here that core activities are the prerequisite for taking up the UPNRM projects meaning thereby that core NRM activities either should have been taken up in any of the earlier programmes implemented in the project area or should form part of the proposed project under UPNRM
Eligible Agencies ( Channel Partners ) 
The project implementing agencies are called Channel partners under UPNRM . 
The eligible channel partners will be : 
State Governments
Banks
Corporates ( including Producers Companies ) 
NGOs
mFIs . 
Financial Products
As UPNRM envisages a shift from project based funding to policy / programme based approach , a basket of alternative financial product contours ( having different tenors , interest rates , loan - grant ratios etc ) are proposed instead of tight - jacket financial product with rigid features . 
The financial products under UPNRM will be loan based products for the eligible sectors / activities
These loan based products may carry some add - ons in the form of grant for skill and capacity building and some other infrastructure supports based on the merit of project . 
The programme intends to offer custom designed package of financial assistance comprising of loan and grant to the channel partners . 
The proposed basket of alternate financial products will be based on channel partners , NRM areas , financial product contours ( different tenors , interest rates , loan - grant ratios , etc ) , TC Components ( Technical standards , processes , guidelines , IKM , capacity building , exposure visits and other TC tools and methodologies ) , use of innovative technologies / processes / approaches ( cluster development , landscape approach , etc ) and needs of specific agro - climatic zones ( Resource poor , hill areas , various agro - climatic zones ) . 
These loan based financial products may be in the form of investment credit ( Term Loan ) for funding core NRM activities and short term credit for supplementary activities either under the new funded NRM projects or the existing NRM projects or a combination of both collectively under a package .

Detailed Proposal
Title of the project : 
Project Background : 
Project Location : Name of the District ( s ) : 
Name of the watersheds to be covered
Project Context : ( Describing the situation or problem the project seeks to address ) 
Lots of interventions pertaining to soil & water conservation measures , eco - restoration , cropping & cultivation practices , village level institutions building , socio - economic awareness , SHG formation , etc . have been carried out in the villages covered under the watershed programme . 
There has been positive impact of these development interventions with reference to groundwater availability , improvement in cropping pattern , increased productivity , employment generation , reduction in migration , confidence building among villagers , empowerment of local people , improvement in ecological conditions especially micro - climate , etc . 
Implementation of Watershed Development Programme has generated additional scope for developmental activities in agriculture , allied and non - farm sector in the project villages . 
In order to make entire efforts sustainable and taking proper benefits of infrastructure developed financial assistance is the urgent need of the area . 
Umbrella Programme for Natural Resource Management
These positive impacts especially rise in water table , crop diversification / coverage of wastelands under cultivation has resulted into increased credit requirements of the villagers . 
As most of the villages covered under watersheds are in remote areas with little communication , infrastructure , the formal credit delivery system has not been able to reach these villages adequately to meet the emergent credit needs . 
In the project area present micro - credit condition is as unde
Formal sources of credit are not accessible . 
Cooperative Societies are almost defunct or not funding for investment activities . 
Farmers are declared defaulters of bank or societies , though they are not wilful defaulters . 
Other financial institutions have also their limitations . 
Due to exorbitant rates of interest charged by money lenders farmers cannot use this source for development . 
SHGs are being formed but have limited resources - not adequate to meet credit needs for the proposed activities
Increased income derived from agriculture and wages from watershed work , is used to repay the loan from informal sources ( Money Lenders ) or the surplus is not enough for taking up the proposed activities . 
As a result of all these factors , majority of the Small / marginal farmers remain out of the purview of the formal credit delivery system . 
Hence , there is a need to fill up this gap and meet the credit needs of the people in order to keep the motivation level of the villagers & to fully harness the benefits of watershed development interventions .

RuPay KCC : 
The Kisan Credit Card ( KCC ) has emerged as an innovative credit delivery mechanism to meet the production credit requirements of the farmers in a timely and hassle - free manner . 
As per the revised guidelines for KCC , the KCC should be a smart card cum debit card which could be used in the ATMs / Hand held Swipe Machines etc . 
RuPay is a new card payment scheme launched by the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) , has been conceived to fulfill RBI’s vision to offer a domestic , open - loop , multilateral system which will allow all Indian banks and financial institutions in India to participate in electronic payments
RuPay has come out with its RuPay KCC offering which leverages the benefits of both KCC and RuPay . 
Advantages of RuPay KCC : 
Unlike Visa and MasterCard networks , RuPay does not charge an entry fee . 
RuPay is well equipped to handle both the single message and dual messaging systems . 
RuPay is a PIN based product so it provides enhanced security . 
It offers complete web based architecture , so member banks will not have to develop a separate file based interface . 
RuPay provides advanced features such as processing of adjustment file to enable Tip and Surcharge processing on the SMS platform too . 
Administration costs & quarterly charges are very low when compared to current international schemes . 
Unlike normal KCC which serves only as an identity card and facilitate recording of transactions on an ongoing basis , RuPay KCC is actually a smart card that can be used at the nearest ATM / PoS for withdrawing cash . 
It removes the necessity of going to PACS or a bank branch to operate the account . 
Special Project - RuPay Kisan Cards
SPU KCC during the last five months has engaged with RRBs and Cooperatives across the country , reviewing their readiness for providing RuPay KCC as ATM cum Debit cards . 
NABARD has been proactive in nature to support RuPay KCC . 
It has come out with guidelines for DCCBs and RRBs for implementing RuPay KCC , provides financial assistance to RRBs and DCCBs from its Financial Inclusion Fund ( FIF ) and Financial Inclusion Technology Fund ( FITF ) for demonstration & implementation of KCCs , ATMs / microATMs and PoS and even printing of cards . 
Steering Committee on KCC : 
A Steering Committee comprising senior representatives from NABARD , NPCI and major Sponsor Banks of RRBs has been constituted to give a push to the efforts of RRBs in issuance of ATM cum Debit cards to all operational KCC accounts . 
Six meetings have so far been conducted to discuss the issues and challenges faced by the RRBs and their Sponsor Banks . 
The Banks were guided for speeding up issuance of RuPay Kisan Cards . 
Click here for list of members of steering committee
Guidelines regarding issue of KCCs in the form of interoperable RuPay Card by Central Cooperative Banks ( CCBs ) and Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs ) with assistance from FITF have been issued . 
Click here for the guidelines
Guidelines , specifically for cooperative banks , have also been issued for implementing payment systems with a brief outline on procedures to joiing National Financial Switch ( NFS ) , NEFT / RTGS etc . 
Handbook for providing card enabled services to RRBs and Cooperatives
There is a lack of awareness about new phrases and technology among those who have joined or are in the process of joining this new technology space only recently . 
This has also been observed in our interactions with the representatives of Regional Rural Banks and Cooperative banks . 
A need was therefore felt to bring together various common terms and systems involved in joining National Financial Switch ( NFS ) , RTGS and NEFT by these banks . 
Therefore , in this reference , the Handbook on providing card enabled services to RBBs and Cooperatives has been prepared by NABARD along with National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) to bring a single point reference to the various concerned stake holders in the rural banking sector . 
Click here for the handbook

Financial Support available from NABARD for implementation of RuPay KCC for Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs ) and Cooperative Banks
Support for ICT solutions
The overall objective of the scheme is to provide technology support through POS and ICT cards ( RuPay Kisan Cards ) to enable RRBs and Cooperatives to provide doorstep banking facilities . 
This will enable their clients to connect with national payment system and avail all types of financial services . All existing and future KCCs will be covered under this scheme . 
Under this scheme , the RRBs and Cooperative Banks can avail support for cost of Micro ATM / POS terminals upto 25 , 000 / - per terminal and for printing & issuing RuPay Kisan Cards upto 25 / - per card . 
For Cooperative banks assistance for cost of integration charges between POS and CBS server is also provided . 
Operational support for ATM
RRBs and Cooperative Banks are being encouraged to provide RuPay KCC to their clients . 
These cards will be used on ATMs / micro ATMs with agri vendors which will result in operational expenditure for the Regional Rural Banks . 
This scheme is an effort to offset this cost . 
RRBs : The scheme covers only operational cost . 
No capital expenditure is covered . 
The Interchange fees / transaction charges upto 15 / - per KCC transaction arising out of the use of RuPay ATM / Debit Kisan Cards on an ATM other than the parent bank including that of white label will be reimbursed . 
This reimbursement is only for KCC transactions . 
Cooperative Banks : 
There are three types of supports available under this scheme . 
ATM Add - on Support for CBS : 
If the bank is running its CBS on ASP model , then an amount upto 580 / - per branch per month is reimbursed . Support for ASP model is extended for a period of 3 years . 
If the bank runs its CBS on ownership model , then an amount upto 20 , 000 / - will be reimbursed per branch as one time cost
Switching Fee : 
An amount of up to 3 / - per transaction for all transactions will be reimbursed towards switching fee charges . 
Inter - change / Transaction charges : 
The interchange fees / transaction charges upto 15 / - per KCC transaction arising out of the use of RuPay ATM / Debit Kisan Cards on an ATM other than the parent bank including that of white label ATMs ( as and when these ATMs will be deployed in the field ) will be reimbursed . 
The support is only for KCC transactions . 
Data Migration / Feeding of PACS data into CBS of Cooperative Banks : As issuance of Rupay KCC to PACS customers will involve large volume of data migration / feeding of PACS account details into the CBS of DCCB , NABARD is providing assistance upto 10 per account to all Cooperative Banks that are fully CBS enabled . 
Support for demonstrating banking technology : 
To Provide financial support to Regional Rural Banks for demonstrating the usage of RuPay Kisan Cards on ATMs and POS machines / micro ATMs . 
This medium of banking would encourage financial inclusion as well as technology in rural banking . 
Under this scheme a grant assistance of 10 lakh per mobile van is available to all the RRBs and a limited number of Cooperative Banks for Mobile Van comprising of ATM , GPRS Router , UPS , POS terminal / micro ATM , etc . ( and any other incidental expenditures linked to the project ) and financial education material in vernacular language . 
Support under FIF for other activities : 
There are various capacity building schemes in place under FIF to help the banks in undertaking technology upgradation for their staff and clients
Banks may make use of the support available for the same . 
Self Help Group - 2
The SHG - Bank Linkage Programme was given a renewed thrust with the launch of SHG - 2 . 
The focus of SHG - 2 would be on voluntary savings , cash credit as a preferred mode of lending , scope for multiple borrowings by SHG members in keeping with repaying capacity , avenues to meet higher credit requirements for livelihood creation , SHG Federations as non - financial intermediary , rating and audit of SHGs as part of risk mitigation system and strengthening monitoring mechanisms . 
Core Banking Solution ( CBS ) to Co - operative Banks
In one of the biggest initiatives towards institution building , NABARD has facilitated the process of bringing the Co - operative Sector onto Core Banking Solution ( CBS ) platform
A total of 201 State and Central Co - operative Banks with 6 , 953 branches from 16 states & 03 UTs of the country , viz . Punjab , Haryana , Gujarat , Maharashtra , UP , Chhattisgarh , MP , Bihar , Karnataka , Tamil Nadu , Kerala , Uttarakhand , Sikkim , Himachal Pradesh , Jammu & Kashmir , Arunachal Pradesh , Chandigarh , Puducherry and Andaman & Nicobar joined the “NABARD initiated Project for CBS in Co - operatives” . 
Two vendors , viz . TCS and Wipro , have implemented the ambitious project across the country . 
All 201 banks with 6 , 953 branches under NABARD Project are fully on CBS . 
This includes 122 new branches which were directly opened on CBS platform . 
Apart from the cooperative banks , Tamil Nadu Industrial Cooperative Bank ( TAICO ) has been taken onboard for roll - out of CBS under the project . 
The model followed in the initiative is Application Service Provider ( ASP ) model using the concept of cloud computing . 
The roll out process is in the final stage and branches are being migrated on CBS platform on a regular basis . 
Now these century old banks have started functioning in the CBS environment at par with the technological platform of the Commercial Banks and Regional Rural Banks and match up with these institutions in providing similar kind of services in the hinterland of the country . 
These banks now extend commensurate services to its existing and new clients keeping in sight the changing scenario and expectation level of the clientele . 
In time , their clients would be in a position to receive various Government incentives / subsidies and also other financial inputs directly in their accounts maintained with the co - operative banks . 
Keywords : - 
Core Banking Solution , Co - operative Banks , CCB , StCB , CBS , Computer Lab , ASP , Cloud Computing
Bringing the Co - operative Banks under Core banking Solution would provide the following advantages
Bring them at par with the technological platform of the Commercial Banks and also RRB and match up with these institutions in providing similar kind of services in the hinterland of the country . 
Transparency and regular reconciliation and balancing of books of account to arrest pilferage . 
Once the Banks are on a technology platform they will be in a position to utilise technological solution furthering the financial inclusion initiative in rural India
The customer of the Banks can avail facilities like Any Branch Banking , e - transfer of funds to anywhere of the country , etc . 
This will also enable GOI to transfer incentive / subsidy / other payments to the account holders based on Aadhaar number . 
Technological solution is expected to release staff members so that there will be more follow - up with the customers and also help bring in new customers / clients to the Banks thus improving the business portfolio . 
Financing and supporting Producer Organisations
NABARD has taken an initiative for supporting producer organizations , adopting a flexible approach to meet the needs of producers . 
In order to give a special focus , the “Producers Organization Development Fund” ( PODF ) has been set up wef 01 April 2011 , with an initial corpus of 50 crore . 
Any registered Producers Organization viz , Producers Company ( as defined under Sec 581 A in part IXA of Company’s Act 1956 ) , Producers Cooperatives , registered Farmer Federations , MACS ( Mutually aided cooperative society ) , industrial cooperative societies , other registered federations , PACS , etc . set up by producers are eligible under the fund . 
Support under PODF is provided as under : 
Credit Support is provided for financial intervention . 
Support in the form of grant , loans , or a combination of these is also available for capacity building & market interventions . 
Since most of the Producers Organisations are having low capital base , scope for NABARD ' s intervention under PODF has been enhanced to support Producers Organisations for contribution to share capital
Indian producers are unable to realize optimal value from their produce and progress further due to fragmentation of land holdings and lack of organization . 
India has over 12 . 5 crore farmer households of which over 85 % are small and marginal farmers with land holdings of less than 2 hectares . 
The average size of land holding is 1 . 33 hectare / farmer household . 
Due to this fragmentation and disorganization , it is not economically viable for the farmers not only to adopt latest technology but also to use high yielding varieties of inputs like seeds and fertilizers . 
They are also unable to realize good value from their marketable surplus by individually selling their produce . 
On the other hand in case of non - farm sector activities , the handloom weavers & artisans are not able to compete with their products in the market due to poor quality & obsolete designs . 
Through better organization , producers can utilize scale to procure inputs at a lower price , and gain more selling power for their produce / product . 
Forming a producer organization can also provide access to timely and adequate finance , build capacity and provide linkages to markets . 
NABARD has , therefore , decided to set up a separate fund titled " Producers Organization Development Fund " ( PODF ) to tackle the issues of non availability of timely credit , capacity building of producers & strengthening of the Producers Organizations and market tie - ups . 
The Fund has been created in NABARD with an initial corpus of 50 crores from out of its operating surplus for the year 2010 - 11 . 
Title and Commencement
A separate Fund titled “Producers Organization Development Fund ( PODF ) ” has been created with an initial corpus of 50 crore with a sanctioning limit of 100 crore out of NABARD’s profits as at the end of the financial year 2010 - 11 and it will be operational with effect from 1st April 2011 .

PACS being the registered cooperative society has been providing credit and other services to its members . 
It has been observed that PACS are generally meeting out the credit requirements of its members . 
However there is a need to provide other services to the farmers and hence PACS should be developed as a unit to meet all their needs . 
To ensure better returns on the agricultural produce , the farmers should not only be encouraged to use the latest technology to increase agricultural production but also to store their produce in a scientific way to minimise storage losses and provide pledge loan to bridge credit gap . 
In order to enable PACS to provide more services to their members and generate income for themselves , an initiative has been taken to develop PACS as multi service centres . 
This will enable PACS to provide ancillary services to its members and diversify its activities . 
Assistance under PODF is available to SCB / CCB / PACS for this purpose . 
PACS , being the registered cooperative society , has been providing credit and other services to its members . 
PACS are generally providing the following facilities to the members : 
Input facilities in form of cash or kind component to members . 
Agriculture implements on hiring basis . 
Storage facility . 
Some of the PACS are also assisting farmers in marketing of their produce . 
However there is a need to provide other services to the farmers . 
The PACS should be developed as a unit for meeting all the needs of the farmers . 
To ensure better returns on the agriculture produce , the farmers should not only be encouraged to use the latest technology to increase agriculture production but also to store their produce in a scientific way to minimise the storage losses and provide pledge loan to bridge credit gap . 
With the decrease in per capita landholding size over a period of time , it is not economical for the farmers to purchase the farm equipments . 
Moreover many new inventions have come in the recent years in the agriculture sector which needs to be brought to the farms . 
The use of the new technology & HYV will increase the productivity of the produce . 
It has also been observed that most of the farmers go in for distress sale of the produce as they are in the need of immediate credit . Further adequate storage capacity is not available in the rural area where even the small farmers can store their produce and avail pledge loan . 
PACS can play an important role in providing these facilities to the farmers . 
To increase the business portfolio of PACS so as to make it a self sustainable entity , it is essential that the PACS should provide additional services like providing agriculture implements on hiring basis , enabling collective purchase of inputs , having good quality storage capacity as per Negotiable Warehouse Receipt System , etc . 
Accordingly , the following facilities can be taken up by PACS to the farmers : 
Agro - Storage centre : 
Upgradation of the existing storage facility or construction of new godown along with sorting / grading unit as per Negotiable Warehouse Receipt System . 
This will enable them to issue warehouse receipts . Based on these receipts , the farmers can get loan against the crop stored and can cultivate the next crop . 
Thus the farmers will be facilitated to get better price by holding the crops without affecting the fund flow position . 
Agro - service Centre : 
Purchase of hi - tech agri - implements like power tiller , land leveller , rotary slasher , movers , seed driller , multi crop planter , paddy transplanter , sprayers , combine harvester etc . depending upon the requirements of members . 
The earning will be from the rental of these equipments . 
Agro - processing centre : 
Primary Processing : Sorting , grading unit , waxing / polishing unit , pre - cooling chambers , etc . 
Secondary Processing : Value addition to produce e . g . Mini rice mill , atta chaki , horticulture produce processing etc . 
Agri - information centre : 
Testing lab for soil & water , creating panel of experts for providing services on payment basis , knowledge dissemination centre , arrange training to farmers . 
The testing lab & expert guidance will be available to farmers at a cost . 
Agri Transportation & Marketing Facilities : 
Procurement of produce , Direct market linkage after aggregation and / or processing , setting up of rural mart etc . 
The PACS , which are either in the area of marketing or intend to undertake this activity , may create this channel to facilitate the farmers in marketing . 
Availability of Funds : 
Loan under PODF : 
NABARD will also support some of the PACS identified by the committee under PODF . 
Eligibility : PACS being a registered society having the membership of the farmers is eligible to be assisted under the fund . Under PODF , loan can be given for the above activities . 
Since the PACS are already an existing legal entity , the requirement of the grant support is not to the extent as in case of Producers Organisations . 
However , to facilitate PACS in taking up these activities for the benefit of the farmers , need based grant support will be available to PACS which should not be utilised towards the capital cost of the project . 
In any case the grant should not exceed 10 % of the loan component . 
Interest free or low interest loan can also be considered in lieu of grant . 
The following activities can be supported under the grant / interest free loan / low interest loan component : 
Knowledge dissemination centre
Training to farmers
Initial administrative cost to start new business activities
Margin by PACS : 
Minimum 10 % of the project cost . 
However in case of rural godown the margin will be as per the scheme , in case the subsidy is claimed by PACS . 
As on now NABARD is not one of the eligible institution to claim subsidy under Grameen Bhandaran Yojana . 
Interest Rate : The interest rate under PODF is fixed by ALCO . 
Repayment : The repayment will be maximum 9 years including grace period of two years . 
Loan through CCB or RRB : 
To facilitate PACS to avail subsidy under Grameen Bhandaran Yojana , loan from PODF can be sanctioned to CCB on getting specific projects from PACS in its area of operation . 
The project of each PACS will be evaluated by RO and recommended to HO , where the ROs have not been delegated the sanctioning power . 
Since CCB will be taking the loan from NABARD for on lending to PACS , CCB may charge maximum additional 1 % interest over and above the interest rate charged by NABARD . 
For example , if the loan is sanctioned to CCB @ 10 % , CCB should not charge more than 11 % from PACS . 
Loan can be routed through RRB ( where DCCB is not in good health ) . 
Other terms & conditions will remain the same as per PODF guidelines . 
In case of loans routed through DCCBs / RRBs , NABARD will continue to be involved in identifying PACS , appraising proposals and monitor project implementation and loan recovery . 
However , this should not make the DCCBs / RRBs feel at any point of time that they are just a pass through agency . 
Loan from CCB / RRB or from own sources : 
PACS can either use their own sources or avail credit facilities from CCB & RRB . 
In such a case , the grant support from PODF is not available . 
CCB or RRB can avail of refinance facilities as per the usual terms & conditions . 
Regional Office will keep a track of the facilities being developed at PACS level and monitor the same at regular interval . 
In cases where loan is from the DCCB or RRB , or own resources are being used and financial support from NABARD is not being taken , NABARD would guide in project formulation , if necessary , so as to enable best utilisation of funds . 
Investment in Venture Capital Funds ( VCF ) 
Objective : To encourage entrepreneurship , innovation , growth and investment in agriculture and rural development . 
Eligibility : The Venture Capital Fund should be SEBI registered and should furnish copy of the Certificate of Registration with SEBI . It should comply with all applicable Rules and Regulation for operation of the fund . 
VCF should be agriculture , agro - processing and rural area focused . 
At least 200 % of NABARD ' s commitment shall be invested by the VCF in the projects that help agriculture and rural development . 
The VCF should be in venture capital activities for at least five years in India and has shown good performance in earlier funds . 
For VCFs with less than five years experience , the promoter organisation should have been in venture capital business for at least 10 years and demonstrated good performance . 
In case of start up VCFs , the selection will be based on ( a ) size of VCF ( b ) profile of other investors ( c ) track record of promoters and their experience in the field ( d ) commitment already received by the VCF from contributors other than the sponsors , which should not be less than 25 % of proposed corpus , before approaching NABARD .

Warehousing Infrastructure
Consequent upon a separate allocation of 2000 crore in 2011 - 12 , as a part of Rural Infrastructure Development Fund ( RIDF ) , for supporting creation of storage infrastructure for agricultural commodities , NABARD set up the Department of Storage and Marketing ( DSM ) in the Head Office . 
The primary objective of DSM is to provide financial assistance to various stakeholders for supporting creation of agriculture storage infrastructure including warehouses , silos and cold chain activities ( cold storage , controlled atmosphere store , reefer vans , pre - cooling units , etc . ) , as also taking suitable steps / initiatives aimed at putting in place mechanism to empower farmers to realise a better price for their produce by improving access to the wider markets . 
In addition , DSM also collaborates with Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority ( WDRA ) for facilitating accreditation / registration of warehouses in the rural areas . 
Some of the initiatives taken by DSM to achieve its objectives are listed in the following paragraphs . 
Direct lending to State Owned Entities
Although RIDF guidelines provided for direct lending to state owned entities for implementing infrastructure projects in rural areas , NABARD had never lent directly to state owned agencies out of RIDF so far . 
Consequent upon the allocation of 5000 crore for supporting creation of storage infrastructure for the year 2012 - 13 , DSM , for the first time , provided direct financial assistance to 07 state owned entities for the construction of 117 new warehouses with the total project cost of more than 400 crore . 
This would result in the creation of an additional storage space of almost 1 . 00 million MT in the states of Andhra Pradesh , Haryana , Karnataka , Punjab , Odissa and Uttar Pradesh . 
Direct assistance to state owned entities is likely to reduce the time taken for the completion of the projects . 
Accreditation / Registration of Warehouses
Government of India ( GoI ) enacted Warehousing Development and Regulation Act in the year 2007 and constituted Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority ( WDRA ) in 2010 . 
WDRA is responsible for the implementation of the provisions of WDR Act and development & regulation of warehousing sector in the country . 
One of the initiatives taken by WDRA pertain to the registration of warehouses , subject to fulfillment of certain benchmarks , thereby enabling them to issue Negotiable Warehouse Receipts ( NWRs ) . 
DSM , at the request of WDRA , prepared separate norms / benchmarks for smaller warehouses in the rural areas , so that they could easily fulfill the requirement of WDRA for accreditation / registration and issue NWRs . 
DSM has also helped Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh ROs in their efforts to get warehouses owned by Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies accredited / registered by WDRA . 
Capacity Building by Stakeholders
An important function of DSM is to undertake steps with a view to building up capacities / capabilities of all the stakeholders , so as to achieve its mandate more effectively . 
In this direction , DSM has helped BIRD to organise training programs for the Officers of NABARD and also for the Officers of Commercial Banks , RRBs and Cooperative Banks . 
DSM also organised a 5 day exposure program for the senior executives of NABARD with a view to providing them an insight into various facets of agricultural storage and marketing sector in the country . 
Similarly , during 2012 - 13 , DSM in collaboration with National Collateral Management Service Ltd . ( NCMSL ) , implemented a pilot project for creating awareness among the farmers and warehousemen about scientific storage and foodgrain management . 
As part of this project , 100 awareness workshops / programs were conducted for farmers and another 20 for the warehousemen in 10 districts of 5 states viz . , Rajasthan ( Bikaner and Sriganganagar ) , Gujarat ( Junagadh and Rajkot ) , Madhya Pradesh ( Indore & Devas ) , Andhra Pradesh ( Guntur and Karnool ) and Karnataka ( Gulbarga & Davengere ) . 
Umbrella Programme for Natural Resource Management
NABARD has been implementing Natural Resource Management projects ( Watershed Development and Wadi Development Programmes ) for the past 20 years under Indo - German collaboration with support from KfW and GIZ . 
The long standing development cooperation between NABARD and German Development Corporation ( GDC ) has been a key contributor in NABARD emerging as an innovator in the natural resource management , influencing policy at national level and improving lives at grass root level . 
In order to further upscale and integrate NABARD’s existing and future Indo - German NRM efforts into one streamlined approach of participatory NRM related interventions , NABARD and GDC has launched the Umbrella Programme on Natural Resources Management ( UPNRM ) . 
The UPNRM integrates NABARD’s existing and future Indo - German NRM efforts into one streamlined approach of participatory NRM related interventions . 
The programme objective is to contribute to mainstreaming of holistic , participatory and financially sustainable livelihood solutions into public NRM policies and financial instruments for improving the livelihoods of the rural poor based on the sustainable natural resource use and management . 
The programme aims at funding community managed sustainable NRM based rural livelihood projects . 
UPNRM is following a programme based approach wherein different channel partners ( agencies ) are being supported for implementing various types of sustainable NRM projects conforming to the flexible programming mechanism on agreed policies and guiding principles of the strategic partners . 
The projects proposed under UPNRM will have to pass through a scrutiny at Guiding Principles level of the programme . 
These principles entail that the projects have to be pro - poor designed on integrated & need based approach , should ensure sustainability , involve community participation and be based on sound and transparent Governance . 
The programme envisages a gradual shift from grant based to loan based NRM projects and funding will be through a corpus comprising Financial Cooperation from KfW as well as fund mobilized by NABARD from various sources . 
The interest rate applicable for projects under UPNRM will depend on the nature of project , channel partners and the target groups . 
Rationale for an NRM Policy : 
Despite India’s recent high economic growth rate , around 350 million out of its more than one billion strong population is still living below one dollar a day . Seventy - five percent ( 262 million ) of India’s poor are living in rural areas , primarily dependent on agriculture and natural resources for their subsistence . 
Acknowledging the rural distress , the Indian Government has declared the development of rural areas a top national priority ( National Common Minimum Programme of the GoI , 2004 ) . 
The most critical elements here are the access to and equitable management of local resources in a viable and sustainable way . 
Although there are several instances of increased policy direction towards greater investment for sustainable management of natural resources from the state and private channels , the policy governing sustainable management for rural livelihoods has not been well defined . 
Hence , it is imperative that a clearly defined NRM sector policy is evolved to give a focused and coordinated attention for management of natural resources for enhanced livelihood for the rural people on a sustainable basis . 
Three Key Challenges : 
With expansion of the public programme for natural resources management ( NRM ) , new challenges are emerging . 
India will find it difficult to provide the huge resources ( over € 13 billion up to 2022 ) needed to achieve the projected target for NRM programmes . 
The Planning Commission Working Group has emphasized to gradually move out of the culture of grants and subsidies by increasing people’s contribution up to 50 % of the costs by 2017 . 
This would require development of new models and programmes for financing and managing watershed development . 
Currently , there are three key challenges faced by NRM sector in India ; 
Development of a suitable policy environment that promotes increased appreciation and investments for NRM activities . 
Increasing public as well as private investment in NRM sector . 
UPNRM Guiding Principles
The UPNRM initiative provides the possibility for NABARD to further develop expertise in NRM issues in the country and become a thematic leader . 
In light of this , the key policy goal of UPNRM is “Supporting sustainable NRM focused initiatives to improve the livelihoods of the socially marginalized / disadvantaged groups ( including poor , women , tribals ) ” . 
In addition , as a policy , UPNRM will promote projects that are implemented employing innovative methodologies and approaches which could be mainstreamed into the traditional NRM approach and projects that have a scope for wider replicability . 
In this context , the programme would be guided by the following overarching principles : 
Pro - poor : 
The programme recognises the need to address socio - economic disparities through ensuring equitable access to environmental resources and quality for all sections of society , particularly the poor and the disadvantaged who are most dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods . 
Ensuring Sustainability : 
The programme emphasises the importance of integration of environmental concerns as essential means for accelerating and sustaining development and human well - being . 
Community participation : 
Empowerment of local communities and their voluntary participation in project design , implementation and monitoring for the appropriate use of natural resources for equitable and sustainable development . 
Good Governance : 
Effective project implementation depends directly on strengthening decentralized governance to ensure participation of rural poor and other disadvantaged groups in local decision - making and achieving equity in ownership , access and use of resources in a transparent and responsible manner . 
The resource management projects should subscribe to the “Subsidiarity” principle to guide the division of decision - making , rule - making , implementation , enforcement and dispute - resolution powers to the lowest possible level . 
Integrated and needs - based approach : 
An integrated approach merges various disciplinary perspectives as well as achieves convergence with existing initiatives to facilitate the development of appropriate technologies / products / approaches that are responsive to the needs of the local community . 
This requires the programme design to be context sensitive and flexible . 
An appraisal matrix for evaluating NRM Projects at “Guiding Principles” level is given hereunder
Pro - poor : Benefits may be measured in terms of : 
Improves short and long - term employment opportunities
Implementation of the project is likely to be against the interest of the poor
Implementation of the project is not likely to have any impact on the poor population in the project area . 
Project benefits < 20 % of poor among target households
Project benefits between 20 - 50 % of poor among target households
Reduces indebtedness
Implementation of the project is likely to deplete the resource base and lead to Environmental Degradation . 
Project does not have any appreciable impact on the local natural resource base
Project includes mitigation measures for avoiding environmental degradation
Project includes measures that conserve / protect the natural resource base of the project area
Community participation
The project discourages community participation
Only one way flow of information from IA to members of the local community on the project activities . 
The project has no provision for community participation . 
Participation of people is through the process of consultations where they define both problems and solutions . 
Community participates in planning and implementation of project interventions through appropriate institutional structures and systems
Good Governance
Equity in ownership , access and use of resources
Adherence to Decentralisation Principles
Accountability and Transparency
Efficiency and Effectiveness
The project implementation is likely to lead to conflicts of interest within village / project households . 
The project does not have any measures for strengthening the existing governance system . 
Project facilitates equitable access to resources . 
Project includes / strengthens mechanism for decentralized decision making , control over funds and activities and improved interface with government and other private service providers
Credit Facilities to Marketing Federations
To support Producers Organizations in carrying out business activities , NABARD has set Producer Organization Development Fund ( PODF ) during 2011 - 12 . 
The fund has supported Producers Organizations by extending credit + facilities to take up production , aggregations , processing and / or marketing activities . 
Since , most of the producer organizations are at nascent stage , their focus is mainly on production and to some extent the aggregation . 
These organizations are unable to take advantages of value addition , market linkage due to various limitations like scale of operations , absence of professional management , fragmented supply chain , poor market linkage , lack of storage and marketing infrastructure . 
Recognizing the importance of scientific storage and marketing infrastructure in improving the efficiency in agribusiness and supply chain management , NABARD is involved in supporting implementation of various projects / activities such as PACS as MSCs wherein the PACS have been recognized as potential partners to act as spoke under Hub and spoke model for developing warehouses and cold chains , funding of storage infrastructure under RIDF to State Govt . and through their warehousing corporations and marketing federations , implementing credit linked subsidy schemes for storage and marketing infrastructure of GOI . 
With the development of additional storage and marketing infrastructure by PACS , warehousing corporations and marketing federations / corporations / cooperatives , many State Marketing Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives have scaled up the marketing support to the farmers through PACS being primary aggregators at ground level . 
Till such time the producer organizations mature to handle the marketing activities efficiently on their own , they can be linked with the existing Marketing Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives by enrolling them as members / shareholders . 
The major limitation for expanding the marketing operations by these federations / corporations / Cooperatives is lack of timely and adequate credit support . 
In order to strengthen Marketing Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives in the marketing and other agriculture activities a separate line of credit , viz . ‘Credit Facilities to Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives’ has been made available for the Marketing Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives to promote the marketing of agriculture produce and other agriculture activities . 
The broad guidelines of Credit Facilities to Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives are as under : 
Eligible Institutions
Marketing Federations / Corporations / Cooperatives having PACS and other producer organizations as members / share holders . 
Nature of credit

The loan to these Marketing Federations / Cooperatives will be governed by Section 30 of NABARD Act , 1981 . 
Eligible activities
Short Term Credit Facility : The major activities covered under the scheme would be crop procurement under Price Support Scheme and supply of seeds , fertilizers , pesticides , plant protection material etc . to the farmers . 
Term Loan Facility : For post - harvest handling including sorting & grading , primary processing , marketing etc . Such
Federations / Cooperatives should also be supported for providing agro advisory services and market information through e - agriculture marketing . 
The loan will be secured by way of hypothecation / creation of first charge on asset purchased / created . 
The collaterals may be in the form of Government / Corporate Guarantee , mortgage of other tangible securities . 
Such securities will be decided on the risk assessment on a case to case basis .

Direct Lending to Cooperative Banks
NABARD has traditionally provided refinance support to central cooperative banks ( CCBs ) through State Co - operative Banks ( SCBs ) . 
The implementation of revival package as per Vaidyanathan Committee recommendations has enabled CCBs to raise financial resources from sources other than the SCB . 
Accordingly , NABARD has designed a Short Term Multipurpose Credit Product for financing directly to CCBs . 
Sanction of Short Term Multipurpose Credit limits to CCBs - - Operational Guidelines
Cooperative banks have been long term business partners of NABARD and are an integral part of the rural financial system . 
The cooperative banks not only cater to the credit needs but also provide other financial services to a majority of farmers , especially small and marginal farmers and weaker sections of society . 
The implementation of GoI Revival Package for STCCS as per Vaidyanathan Committee recommendations has enabled CCBs to borrow funds directly from any financial institution regulated / approved by RBI . 
The CCBs have also been given autonomy to diversify their loan business in order to increase profitability and achieve viability on a sustainable basis . 
Accordingly , a Short Term Multipurpose Credit Product’ has been developed and the limits are sanctioned to eligible CCBs under Section 21 ( 1 ) ( i ) to ( v ) read with Section 21 ( 2 ) of the NABARD Act , 1981 . 
Purposes covered
The credit limits will be sanctioned to CCBs for lending to individuals ( such as farmers , traders , artisans etc ) through their branches and through PACS for variety of purposes such as : 
Working Capital requirements
Repair and maintenance of farm equipment and other productive assets
Storage / grading / packaging of produce
Marketing activities
Crop loan ( if the requirement is more than 3 . 0 lakh ) 
Redemption of old debts and other socio - economic needs
In addition to the above , all purposes which are covered under section 21 ( 1 ) ( i ) to ( v ) NABARD Act , 1981 , is also eligible for refinancing under this product
Eligibility Norms for CCBs
The credit limit will be sanctioned to well governed and financially strong ‘A’ & ‘B’ categories of CCBs as per the latest inspection report of NABARD and the bank should have been licensed by RBI . 
Operative period & nature of limit
The credit limit sanctioned will be operative for a period of one year from the date of sanction of the limit . 
However , loans disbursed by the CCB prior to the date of sanction of the limit by NABARD can also be considered for refinance , provided , the loan is disbursed in the same financial year i . e . 01 April & onwards and is “non - overdue” . 
The credit limit sanctioned will be in the nature of cash credit accommodation and the CCB may draw and repay as many times as required , provided the loan outstanding in the account does not exceed the credit limit sanctioned . 
The limit can be considered for renewal after completion of one year provided the account has been operated satisfactory and the CCB meets the eligibility criteria and other requirements as per the scheme . 
Quantum of credit limit
The credit limit will be sanctioned to eligible CCBs to the extent of 100 % of their lending programme after due diligence . 
While sanctioning the loan limit to the CCB , the financial position of the CCB , trend and growth rates , potential available for the loan products in the district , absorption capacity of the CCB etc will be taken in to account while sanctioning the credit limit . 
HO would decide the rate of interest on refinance to this product from time to time . 
The interest is payable at quarterly rests . 
In the event of default by CCB in repayment of loans or any part thereof and / or in the event of default in payment of interest or any portion thereof on due dates , an additional interest of 2 % over and above the interest rate at which the limit has been sanctioned will be charged for the period during which the default persists . 
Risk appraisal & Rating of CCB
The appraisal of the CCB will be carried out in the following areas : 
Financial appraisal of the CCB
Each item of the Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss account of the CCB for the last 3 years should be analysed to observe trends and any issues that may be of concern . 
Credit risk assessment of the CCB - 
A credit risk rating tool , based on CAMELSC and other relevant parameters has been specifically designed to assess the credit risk of CCBs . 
The risk rating would be carried out on the basis of NABARD’s inspection report ( IR ) which should not be more than 15 months old . If the IR is more than 15 months old , then the rating should be carried out on the basis of latest audited financial statements and audit report of the bank . 
Based on the score obtained from the risk rating tool , the rating category is assigned to the bank . 
Security Norms
The CCB shall pledge unencumbered fixed deposit receipts ( FDRs ) issued by Scheduled Banks as security to the loan . 
At present , the quantum of FDRs to be pledged to NABARD is determined as per the table given below : 
Rating score : 81 % & above
CRAR : 9 % & above
Gross NPA level : Less than 5 % 
Pledge of FDRs to the extent of 50 % of limit sanctioned . 
All three parameters , viz . , score obtained from the risk rating tool , CRAR and Gross NPAs have to be read together and in case any one of the parameters do not qualify in that particular grade , it will go one grade below . 
The quantum of security prescribed in the above matrix is minimum . 
NABARD has liberty to demand additional quantum of security , if need be , irrespective of the minimum security prescribed in the above table . 
It is possible that the CCB concerned may not be in a position to provide the fixed deposit receipts covering the entire sanctioned amount at the time of first drawal from the account , therefore . ROs may permit drawals provided the prorata fixed deposit receipts pledged covers the amount to be drawn under the sanction . 
In other words , ROs should ensure that the outstanding loan amount is always covered by securities taken on prorata basis . 
Inspection of books of accounts
NABARD reserves the right to inspect / arrange to inspect the books of accounts of the bank as part of the lending agreement . 
Special Audit
NABARD would have the right to cause special audit of the books of accounts and other relevant material of the CCBs either by itself or through other agencies to ensure that the same are maintained as per the rules and regulations in force and the terms and conditions of refinance are adhered to by the bank . 
Direct Lending to Cooperative Banks – Working Capital Loans to SCBs / CCBs against Pledge limits to Cooperative and Private Sugar factories
NABARD has been traditionally providing refinance assistance to SCBs on behalf mof CCBs for various Short term credit activities under its Short Term Credit policy . 
It has been observed that SCBs / CCBs have availed refinance from NABARD mostly for seasonal agricultural operations and other short term credit requirements are met mainly from their own resources . 
In order to unlock the funds of SCBs / CCBs and enable them to make prompt payments to farmers towards procurement of sugarcane , it has been decided to provide refinance assistance to SCBs / CCBs against pledge limits sanctioned to cooperative and private sugar factories . 
Accordingly , a short term credit product for CCBs / SCBs for sanction of pledge limits to cooperative and private sugar factories has been developed . The features of the credit product are given as under : 
Refinance assistance to cooperative Banks viz SCBs and CCBs against loans to cooperative and private sugar factories against pledge of sugar stocks so as to enable them to unlock their funds blocked for other activities . 
The refinance would be provided to State Cooperative Banks ( SCBs ) and Central Cooperative Banks ( CCBs ) which are rated as " A " or " B " category as per the latest Inspection report of NABARD . 
Refinance assistance will be provided to eligible cooperative banks i . e . SCBs / CCBs for sanction of pledge limits to sugar factories in cooperative and private sector against pledge of sugar stocks for prompt payment to farmers towards procurement of sugarcane and also to meet out their internal expenditure . 
The refinance assistance would also unlock their funds so as to enable them to diversify their loan business . 
The refinance would be provided to SCBs / CCBs for financing to sugar factories against pledge limit under section 21 of NABARD Act 1981 as given under :

The bank should follow instructions issued by RBI in this regard from time to time . 
Extent of Refinance : 
The refinance assistance is available from NABARD to the extent of 75 % of the limit sanctioned by SCB / CCB to the sugar factory . 
Operations on the credit limit :

NABARD Infrastructure Development Assistance ( NIDA ) 
NIDA is a new line of credit support for funding rural infrastructure projects . 
NIDA is designed to fund State owned institutions / corporations on both on - budget as well as off - budget for creation of rural infrastructure outside the ambit of RIDF borrowing . 
The assistance under NIDA is available on flexible interest terms with longer repayment period upto 15 years ( 2 - 4 years repayment holiday ) . 
Objectives of the NIDA Programme
NABARD is deeply committed to rural development , and infrastructure is an integral part of this development . 
Traditionally , NABARD has been closely working with State Governments through RIDF to fund various infrastructure initiatives . 
However , this channel for creation of rural infrastructure faces certain issues : 
Borrowing power of State Governments is limited under Article 293 , thus limiting the off - take of RIDF
Prioritizing infrastructure to be created through RIDF funds is often dictated by the political environment
In the course of multiple interactions with State Governments , it was understood that State Governments would like a wider range of financial products to support creation of rural infrastructure . 
In addition , State Governments are looking for avenues to borrow off - budget ( eg . through corporations ) to avoid exceeding their borrowing power limits . 
Based upon this , the NABARD Infrastructure Development Assistance programme was designed for State Governments and other state - owned organizations . 
NIDA aims to fund rural infrastructure creation by providing assistance to state governments , outside of RIDF borrowing , and other state - owned organizations ( eg . Corporations ) , through direct financing based upon risk appraisal of the specific project . 
Overview of the NIDA offering
The following are the key features of the current NIDA credit offering . 
The unique feature of NIDA is that the terms will be customized as per the borrower’s requirements , based upon the project and borrower’s risk profile . 
Type of loan : Term loan
Tenure : Long term , upto 15 years
Interest rate : Will vary based upon project and risk profile of borrower . Interest rates will be linked to NABARD’s market borrowings . As of now , NIDA products offer fixed interest rate over the tenure of the loan ; however this can be reviewed in future
Moratorium : Based upon the specific project and borrower , moratorium of upto 2to 4 years can be considered
Security : Appropriate security will have to be provided by borrower , based upon risk profile and nature of project . 
State Govt . guarantee is not mandatory , but can be requested based upon the risk profile and nature of project
Repayment : Repayment schedule can be designed based upon borrower’s requirements , nature of project and risk profile . Eg . based upon borrower’s cash flows , a ballooning repayment schedule can be designed , with the greater share of principle repayment structured towards the later tenure of the loan
The NIDA credit offering can be further refined , and additional products ( eg . annuity based products , mezzanine capital , PPP etc . ) Can be structured based upon borrower requirements and market demand . 
In addition , NIDA also aims to leverage NABARD’s existing development schemes as well as technical expertise by offering Credit + support to infrastructure projects . 
The following areas have been identified as potential credit + support that can be offered with NIDA projects . 
The aim is to offer credit + support for a fee , in order to ensure it is a sustainable venture for NABARD . 
Project evaluation and monitoring : 
NABARD can support the borrower from the initial stages of DPR ( Detailed Project Report ) preparation , to monitoring of the progress of the project to ensure efficient use of funds for infrastructure creation . 
Going ahead , appropriate IT tools may be developed ( similar to World Bank , Andhra Pradesh govt’s project monitoring tools ) to monitor progress of infrastructure creation . 
Technical advisory support : 
NABARD can provide technical advisory support to the borrower , through internal expertise as well as NABCONS . 
The technical advisory support can help borrowers in designing the project , as well as ensuring successful operationalization of the project . 
Linkage with existing development schemes : 
NABARD has a host of development schemes that can be offered , as per the requirements of the infrastructure project . 
The aim of offering these schemes would be to enhance the utility of the infrastructure . 
Eg . POs and Farmer Clubs can be created in the area where warehouse is being constructed , and encouraged to utilize the new warehouse . 
Submission of Detailed Project Report ( DPR ) 
The Detailed Project Report ( DPR ) is the starting document required to be submitted by the borrower . 
Most DPRs received for RIDF projects focus on technical details of project only . 
Under NIDA , it will be critical to also have a detailed business plan that indicates the financial viability of the project and borrower . 
In addition , multiple other documents are required to support the DPR . 
A typical DPR should contain : 
Details of the borrower , including company background , shareholding pattern , existing bankers etc .

Welcome to ni - msme . 
ni - msme , since its inception in 1960 by the Government of India , has taken gigantic strides to become the premier institution for the promotion , development and modernization of the SME sector . 
An autonomous arm of the Ministry of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSMEs ) , the Institute strives to achieve its avowed objectives through a gamut of operations ranging from training , consultancy , research and education , to extension and information services . 
A Centre of Excellence
It was in 1984 that the UNIDO had recognized SIET as an institute of meritorious performance under its Centers of Excellence Scheme to extend aid . 
Subsequently , it was also accorded national status and SIET Institute became nisiet in the same year . 
To cope with the precut of globalization , the Government of India has enacted Micro , Small , Medium Enterprises Development ( MSMED ) Bill in the Parliament which was commenced on 2nd October 2006 . 
Accordingly , the institute also has emerged as an apex organisation by changing its structure as well as name as ni - msme from 11th April 2007 . 
ni - msme was originally set up as Central Industrial Extension Training Institute ( CIETI ) in New Delhi in 1960 as a Department under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce , Government of India . 
It was decided to keep it free from the tardy and impeding administrative controls and procedures , so that the Institute can play a pivotal role in the promotion of small enterprise . 
Therefore the Institute was shifted to Hyderabad in 1962 , and was renamed as Small Industry Extension Training ( SIET ) Institute . 
SIET , as it was fondly known for over two decades later , is managed by Governing Council , appointed by the Government of India . The Founder - Chairman of SIET is Dr P . C . Alexander , the then Development Commissioner ( Small Scale Industries ) . 
SIET was conferred the status of national institute by the Government of India with the charter of assisting in the promotion of Small Enterprises mainly by creating a pro - business environment
In 1984 , the UNIDO had recognised SIET as an institute of meritorious performance under its Centres of Excellence Scheme
Subsequently , it was also accorded the national status in the same year and SIET Institute became nisiet . 
Since then the institute has come a long way , carving a place of distinction for itself in the domain of entrepreneurship promotion , achieving recognition both at the national level and in the international arena . 
To cope with the pressure of globalisation , the Government of India has enacted the MSMED Bill in the Parliament , which became effective from 2nd October 2006 . 
Accordingly , the Institute , in order to reflect the expanded focus of its objectives with name was rechristened as ni - msme from 11th April 2007 and re - desined its structure and organisation . 
It is an organisation of the Ministry of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ( formerly Ministry of SSI & ARI ) , Government of India . 
The ni - msme ( formerly as SIET ) was registered at Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh under Public Societies Registration Act I of 1350 Fasli with effective from 1st July 1962 . 
Administration of the society
The affairs of the Society are managed , administered , directed and controlled through Governing Council constituted by the Government of India as per Rule 22 ( a & b ) of Rules and Regulations of the Society . 
The Society , as provided under Rule 3 of Rules and Regulations , was constituted by the Government of India . 
Mr Kalraj Mishra , Hon ' ble Union Cabinet Minister , Ministry of MSME , Govt . of India is the President of the Society and Chairman of the Governing Copuncil of ni - msme . 
Dr . Anup K . Pujari , IAS , the Secretary to the Govt . of India , Ministry of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises is the Vice - President of the Society , Vice - Chairman of the Governing Council and Chairman of the Executive Committee
Mr Amarendra Sinha , IAS , Special Secretary to the Govt . of India & Development Cimmissioner ( MSME ) is the Vice - Chairman of the Executive Committee . 
Mr . M . Chandrasekhar Reddy is the Director General of the Institute . 
From being merely trainers we have widened our scope of activities to consultancy , research , extension and information services .

From the time of inception , ni - msme has been providing unstintied support to small and medium industries and has evolved to be the best in offering services like research , consultancy , information , training and extension to not only enterprises but also to concerned development agencies . 
The knowledge driven and volatile economy of the present days is posing greater challenges to MSMEs .

MSME development generally refers to facilitating progress in the economy and generation of employment by enhancing business development services , and establishing a conducive legal , regulatory and policy environment . 
In this context , the School of Enterprise Development [ SED ] acts as a catalyst for dynamic , integrated change in Micro and Small Enterprise ( MSE ) sector , looking strategically and optimistically towards the future challenges . 
The activities of the SED include programme evaluation studies , research projects , feasibility studies , potential surveys , rural enterprise promotion , backward area development , infrastructure development programme and project implementation for central and state governments , that advances an innovative and enterprise growth in the global and national scenario . 
On the international front , the SED provides a bridge between theory and practice of small business and MSE development by guiding / training the executives of MSME in formulation , development , implementation and evaluation of various facets of enterprise policy , with a focus to make the MSE sector more competitive in the global economic scene . 
Besides imparting training to the officials , the experienced and well - known faculty of the school focus on economic surveys in the nature of diagnosing the industrial potential , networking with national and international agencies , and other research studies pertaining to government programmes / schemes and impact studies . 
Balance and spread are the two crucial aspects of industrialisation . 
Overlooking these aspects has led to regional imbalance and wide belts of rural and urban poverty . 
At the C - IPD , continuous effort is made to reduce the gravity of this situation . 
The focus of the centre is to make the SME sector more competitive in the global economic scene through integrated planning . 
To achieve this , the centre functions with an accent on promoting enterprise development programmes specific to prioritised sector , including income generation , infrastructure and environmental management . 
Apart from training , the activities of the centre include programme evaluation studies , research projects , feasibility studies , potential surveys , programme and project implementation for central and state governments , rural enterprise promotion and infrastructure development . 
A sound policy base is what makes an economic venture thrive and flourish . 
The Centre primarily undertakes studies on the and ramifications of industrial policy and also other policy issues , which have a bearing on economic development . 
The Center ' s focus is on networking with other countries and international agencies , monitoring changes and chalking out suggestions , to ensure the competitiveness of Indian industry through well directed planning to integrate with global economy . 
To cater to the needs of the small enterprises in the country and to enable the SME sector to face the challenges of globalisation , the Small Industries Development Organisation ( SIDO ) has launched Small Industry Cluster Development Programme . 
In this context , it was felt necessary to constitute a national level resource centre to promote cluster development in the country to pace the operations of small enterprises . 
The National Resource Centre for Cluster Development ( NRCD ) came into existence in January 2004 , at ni - msme with the active support of the Development Commissioner ( SSI ) , Government of India . 
NRCD has executed three phases of training for 20 cluster development executives of SIDO and provided handholding and monitoring services during implementation . 
The centre also organised training programmes on cluster development for the officials of various state governments , support institutions , directors of SISIs , bank officials , NGOs , SFURTI officials . 
It had also organised training programme on cluster development for the officials sponsored by other countries . 
In addition , it is directly involved in implementation of cluster development initiatives in Crochet Lace cluster , Narsapur . 
At present , it is also implementing cluster development initiatives in two handloom clusters at Barabanki and Mubarakpur in UP .

The on - going liberalisation brought in its wake enhancement in the investment outlay of small scale sector . 
Due to a corresponding increase in its financial requirements more or less on par with large enterprises in the corporate sector , a need arose for the small scale sector to explore capital markets both within the country and globally . 
he Centre for Industrial Credit and Financial Services outlined its scope and objectives afresh as demanded by such challenges in the changing environment . 
Intellectual Property Rights ( IPRs ) are increasingly being used the world over as a business tool to achieve economic gains in the era of technological competitiveness . 
With the opening up of our economy , SMEs too have become vulnerable to competition from the overseas giants . 
SMEs in India consider IPRs to be an esoteric concept and are still unaware that their ability to convert knowledge into wealth through the process of innovation will determine their future . 
The issues of generation , valuation , protection and exploitation of intellectual property are going to become critically important for SMEs all around the world . It is with this view , to address the need of development of skills and competence to manage IPRs , and leverage its influence amongst SMEs in India , we propose to set up a Centre for IPRs at nisiet . 
The Centre will endeavour to narrow the knowledge gap that exists between the SMEs of developed and developing countries . 
In order to meet the growing requirements of the Industry in the new millennium , nisiet has launched a Centre for Logistics And Integrated Materials Systems ( C - LAIMS ) in addition to the existing Centres further reinforcing and consolidating the services of the Institute .

In the light of globalization , liberalization and privatisation and free trade , industrial sector in India has been undergoing rapid changes . 
With the result , now the stress is more on standards , quality , and efficiency as never before . 
Environmental compliance is increasingly being stressed upon , specially in the case of exports . 
Competition from foreign companies , big industries and multinational companies complicates this situation further . 
Consequently , small and medium scale industries are in a crisis . 
Largely speaking , industrial pollution is associated with large manufacturing units , a perception that is reinforced whenever there is a major environmental accident involving a major industry . 
Interestingly , the last five years have witnessed a shift of focus in understanding the impact of pollution generated by SMEs all over the world . 
Large scale manufacturers provide a relatively easy target for the authorities in terms of regulating and controlling emissions and discharges . 
The Small and Medium Units , however , on account of their large number , variety of manufacturing activities , wide dispersal , and lack of funds for research and development , present a different picture entirely . 
Besides , most of them are located within the heart or in the proximity of cities , which aggravates the impact of pollution both in terms of environmental degradation and human health . 
Small industry development is in a transition phase . 
Modernizing and making it internationally competitive are the major policy objectives . 
There has been a welcome change in the environmental policy of the Ministry of Environment and Forests , Government of India for strengthening resource conservation in the country and promoting clean process technologies . 
Many of the highly polluting industries in the small scale sector are important from the angle of contribution to industrial production , employment generation and export promotion . Some of the prominent groups are : 
Chemical and allied industries , leather industries , textile processing , drugs and pharmaceuticals , agro - chemicals and food processing industries . 
Pollution has to be looked at in an integrated way . 
Liquid effluents , air pollution , solid wastes and gaseous emissions , all need to be treated by using the appropriate treatment processes and devices . 
A number of innovative approaches and management practices are being pursued in the context of small industries in different parts of the country . 
Success has been of varying degrees in different regions and in different industry groups . 
Involvement of industry in implementing environmental audit as well as anti - pollution measures has been recognized as very important in bringing about awareness and in motivating them to take the implementation process to a higher level in a phased manner . 
There is no official data available on the quality and quantity of pollution from small scale industries . 
However , the aggregate pollution capacity due to large number of small scale units has an alarming impact on the environment . 
Recent judicial and regulatory intervention , in disciplining the erring units by ordering closure , penalizing and shifting of location have certainly created some degree of anxiety among the entrepreneurs . 
nisiet , being a premier Institute for the development and modernization of small and medium scale industries , realizing the challenge urgency and the need of the hour , has decided to establish a centre totally dedicated to environmental concerns vis - à - vis the Small and Medium Enterprises . 
The mission of the centre is to promote sustainable development of small and medium enterprises through implementation of pollution prevention and control techniques . 
To design and conduct need - based training programmes , workshops and seminars for environmental management . 
To function as a clearing house for cleaner technologies . 
To develop research and development facility and take up research activities in the areas of environment and pollution control . 
To act as a catalyst in building up an institutional network involving national and international organisations . 
To undertake different kinds of status and evolution studies and extend consultancy services . 
To promote entrepreneurship in the area of environmental goods and services . 
To promote and strengthen the concept of greening of supply channel .

What is NIOS ? 
NIOS is an " Open School " to cater to the needs of a heterogeneous group of learners up to pre - degree level . 
It was started as a project with in - built flexibilities by the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) in 1979 . 
In 1986 , the National Policy on Education suggested strengthening of Open School System for extending open learning facilities in a phased manner at secondary level all over the country as an independent system with its own curriculum and examination leading to certification . 
Consequently , the Ministry of Human Resource Development ( MHRD ) , Government of India set up the National Open School ( NOS ) in November 1989 . 
The pilot project of CBSE on Open School was amalgamated with NOS . 
Through a Resolution ( No . F . 5 - 24 / 90 Sch . 3 dated 14 September 1990 published in the Gazette of India on 20 October 1990 ) , the National Open School ( NOS ) was vested with the authority to register , examine and certify students registered with it up to pre - degree level courses . 
In July 2002 , the Ministry of Human Resource Development amended the nomenclature of the organisation from the National Open School ( NOS ) to the National Institute of Open Schooling ( NIOS ) . 
With a mission to provide relevant continuing education at school stage , up to pre - degree level through Open Learning system to prioritized client groups as an alternative to formal system , in pursuance of the normative national policy documents and in response to the need assessments of the people , and through it to make its share of contribution : 
To universalisation of education , 
To greater equity and justice in society , and

Within the overall provisions of the National Curriculum Framework ( NCF - 2005 ) , NIOS has brought out a significant documnet titled " Vocational Educaiton and Training : A Framework on Curriculum Imparatives with a Foucs on Knowledge Acquisition and Skills Development : Initiative through Open and Distance Learning " .

The NIOS programmes pay special attention towards requirements of the first generation learners , physically , mentally and visually challenged learners and candidates from disadvantaged sections of the society . 
How does NIOS Function ? 
NIOS operates through a network of five Departments , Regional Centres and Accredited Institutions ( Study Centres ) in India and abroad . 
It has a current enrolment of about 2 . 71 million students at Secondary , Senior Secondary & Vocational levels which makes it the largest open schooling system in the world . 
Chairman ' s Message
The National institute of Open Schooling ( NIOS ) has entered into its adulthood and completed two decades of its existence in the field of Open and Distance Learning ( ODL ) in the school education sector . 
This journey of the Institute has been quite successful . With about 2 . 71 million students on its roll , NIOS is credited to be the largest open school in the world with significant popularity in the Commonwealth countries and in certain other developing and developed countries . 
NIOS has been offering Secondary and Senior Secondary and Vocational Education & training ( VET ) courses through its study centers and Open Basic Education Programme through Accredited Agencies . 
NIOS not only offers a wide spectrum of courses of study up to the pre - degree level for all categories of learners , but also works as a nodal institute for carrying forward the open school movement in the country in order to achieve the objective of developing an inclusive learning society . 
This has been possible due to dedication and unstinting support from all faculty and staff of the institute and other stakeholders . 
However , there are some tasks and issues that need quick intervention and concerted attention as indicated below : 
The success of ODL system largely depends on satisfaction of its learners , not only in terms of what is the quality of academic support they receive but also up to what extent they are empowered during the learning process . 
NIOS needs to work in this direction by consolidating and strengthening its academic support system . 
The National Curriculum Framework ( NCF 2005 ) has posed several challenges of education before all of us , particularly in the school education sector ; not only what is to be learnt but also to ensure the effectiveness of the process of learning . 
It emphasizes giving more freedom and autonomy to the learner . 
Hence , there is a need to revisit the curriculum of NIOS for making learning more and more learner oriented . 
NIOS needs to focus more on those disadvantaged groups of the society , who have been discriminated against getting education for long due to varied socio - economic reasons . 
We are in the process of developing workable and implementable action plans with due priority for reaching the unreached and uplifting them in the social structure by providing relevant and need based quality education . 
Besides SCs , STs , Girls and differently abled , NIOS has visualized a programme of education of minorities . The programme for education of minorities has already been started and it is in the process of expansion . 
In recent years , the modern technologies have been playing varied roles . 
Among other things , the Information and Communication Technology ( ICT ) is being used widely by NIOS in the school education arena , particularly at the secondary and senior secondary levels . 
A comprehensive vision and perspective plan is being developed to harness the benefits of ICT for facilitating teaching - learning and other ODL endeavours . 
We are taking several steps for empowering the distance learners through our own efforts and by using the public - private partnership ( PPP ) mode of cooperation and collaboration . 
Some of the significant ICT based programmes that need focused attentions are : 
On - line admission
On - Demand Examination System ( ODES ) 
Interactive Voice Response system ( IVRS ) 
24x7 admission facility . 
Capacity building of functionaries is an integral part of the ODL system . 
It is all the more important in the school education sector keeping in view the fact that a large number of personnel are associated with the system for planning , implementation and monitoring of educational programmes . 
NIOS has to develop a comprehensive system to ensure that the capacity building activities becomes an integral component at all levels including the functionaries working under the State Open Schools ( SOSs ) . 
We have to make the open schooling system a vibrant agent to meet this challenge of capacity building of ODL functionaries not only at the national level ; but also at the international level with support from international agencies like the Commonwealth of Learning ( COL ) and UNESCO . 
In any instructional process , including ODL , research is an integral component not only to strengthen the system internally but also to contribute significantly to meet the national and societal goals . 
This area needs to be given significant attention for strengthening the instructional process as well as for making education relevant and need based to the learners . 
These efforts will prove useful in placing the open schooling programme on a sound pedestal . 
NIOS is making concerted efforts for development of ODL system , particularly at the school level , by establishing a network of open schools to further strengthen the open schooling movement in country with the support from the Government of India and the State Governments . 
There is a need to bring a happy balance between expectations from the institution and the actual contribution made by it to the society . 
Our endeavor would be to make the student a good human being and a useful member of the society . 
In this context , providing suitable vocational education and training ( VET ) to specific target groups who want to enter the world of work is our priority agenda to be implemented mainly through PPP mode . 
Societal expectations do not have any limits ; however one must strive to make concerted efforts to meet these expectations as far as possible . 
The ODL system , like that of NIOS , therefore , has to work within the parameters of expectations and contributing substantially to the nation ' s endeavours for universalisation of school education . 
Let us join hands for providing appropriate responses to the challenges of education .

Evaluation System
Evaluation and Assessment is an integral component of any teaching - learning system . 
The Government of India in 1990 vested NIOS with the authority to examine and certify students up to pre - degree level , and thus , NIOS became one of the National Boards of Examination . 
It is the only Board which conducts two full - fledged examinations every year . 
NIOS has been conducting its public examinations since 1991 . 
Unique Features of the NIOS Examination System
NIOS does not have the infrastructure of its own . 
It shares the infrastructure and human resources of the institutions established by the public sector and private sector to conduct its examinations without disturbing their academic schedule . 
NIOS gives a lot of flexibility to the students in matters related to examination such as ( no compulsion of appearing in all the subjects at the same examination ) appearing in one or more subjects in the examination as per the convenience , credit accumulation of the passed subjects , nine chances to appear in the public examinations over a period of five years , and transfer of credit of two subjects passed from other selected boards and up to four subjects in the case of ex - NIOS learners . 
A student is allowed to write answers in the examination in any of the scheduled languages of India except language papers even if he / she has not opted for that medium . 
A student can appear in On Demand Examination at Secondary level and Senior Secondary level examination any number of times as per his / her convenience .

What is retirement planning and how to ensure an independent life even when one retires from active work life ? 
Retirement planning involves disciplined saving , vigilant investment to build a sufficient retirement corpus and its judicious drawdown in the post - retirement phase .

NPS seeks to inculcate the habit of saving for retirement amongst the citizens . 
It is an attempt towards finding a sustainable solution to the problem of providing adequate retirement income to every citizen of India . 
Under the NPS , individual savings are pooled in to a pension fund which are invested by PFRDA regulated professional fund managers as per the approved investment guidelines in to the diversified portfolios comprising of government bonds , bills , corporate debentures and shares .

In Indian context , annuities in simple terms , are financial instruments which offer a monthly / quarterly / annual pension at a guaranteed rate for the period you choose for a given purchase price . 
Annuity Service Providers are IRDA licensed and regulated Life Insurance companies , transacting annuity business in India and who are empanelled by PFRDA for servicing the annuity requirements of the NPS subscribers . 
At present the following 7 ASPs are providing the Annuity services to NPS subscribers : 
Reliance Life Insurance Co . Ltd . 
Star Union Dai - ichi Life Insurance Co . Ltd . 
These ASP’s are prudentially regulated and monitored by Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority ( IRDA ) . 
Under National Pension System ( NPS ) , the subscriber has the option to choose the type of Annuity and the Annuity Service provider . 
The subscriber may choose the annuity type / scheme basing on his requirements from amongst the available schemes offered by the respective ASP’s . 
Currently , the following types of annuities are generally available with the ASP’s .

However , all these premium rates would be as per the approvals received by the respective Annuity Service Provider from Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority ( IRDA ) for the annuity product and variant . 
I had announced the institution of Visitor’s Awards for Best University , Innovation and Research during the last year’s Conference . 
This decision has been implemented and I will have the pleasure of presenting these Awards this evening . 
They promise , in the near future , to become a driving force in promoting research and innovation in our universities . 
There is an urgent need to put ICT Networks to effective use . 
Through the video - conferencing facility of NKN , I have so far interacted with faculty and students of your universities three times . 
When I delivered my New Year Message on 19th January , 2015 , 120 institutions of higher learning were connected through the National Knowledge Network and another 900locations through web - cast mode . 
I would urge the Ministry and all our leaders in research and education institutions to use NKN’s reach to transform the quality of higher education system in our country . 
The students passing out from the Indian higher education system will necessarily have to compete with the best in the world . 
There is a need to imbue young minds with competitive spirit and a sense of pride in their alma mater . 
In addition to international rankings , the universities should attempt ratings on a National Ranking Framework which needs to be expeditiously developed . 
Government has taken several steps for enhancing efficiency and excellence in our higher education sector . 
However , because of the diversities in our evaluation systems , students have suffered in the acceptance of their credentials across the university system as also in accessing employment opportunities . 
The initiative of Choice Based Credit System ( CBCS ) will ensure seamless mobility of students across the Higher Education Institutions in the country as well as abroad . 
The credits earned by the students can be transferred and would be of great value to them in the event of their seeking migration from one institution to the other . 
I am told that 23 central universities have already implemented CBCS . 
I urge the remaining universities to consider implementing this system from the next academic year . 
The university is a role - model for society at large . 
Its persuasive power extends beyond the classroom and teaching . 
Its influence therefore must be tapped for the greater good . 
The Central Government has launched several initiatives having enormous socio - economic significance . 
The Swachh Bharat Missionaims at a Clean India by the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019 . 
The Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana ( SAGY ) envisages the integrated development of selected villages through community participation . 
I call upon you , as I had done with the NITs last year , to start working with at least five villages each under SAGY to transform them into model villages . 
In my observations so far , I have briefly touched upon some of the issues that you will deliberate upon . 
It is equally important for us to focus on the challenges that lie ahead and recognize the emerging global trends that are likely to bring in sweeping changes in the higher education system worldwide . 
Rising costs of higher education and the changing profile of education seekers , aided by technological innovation , are leading to the creation of alternative models of knowledge dispensation . 
Cost of creation of physical infrastructure and academic facilities , increasing salaries of teaching and non - teaching staff put a severe pressure on the finances of a university . 
Due to limitations of public funding , these costs get transferred to students in terms of higher fees . 
Whereas universities earlier used to educate fresh scholars , they now have the added responsibility of training and re - training workers throughout their careers . 
An Oxford University Study predicts automation of 47 percent occupations in the next few decades . As innovation eliminates certain job types , changes others and creates new ones , the workforce will have to engage in lifelong learning to upgrade and refine their skills and capabilities . 
The twin compulsions of increasing expenditure and dynamic demand can be addressed through extensive use of e - enabled learning . Massive Open Online Courses ( MOOCs ) , which first began in 2008 , allow students to hear lectures and read course material on - line , and earn a degree at a fraction of the cost of the traditional systems of education . 
Both SWAYAM ( Study Web of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds ) and MOOCs could pave the way for speed , scale and efficiency for teaching in the higher education system . 
The Ministry of HRD and the institutes of higher learning should develop eco - systems for deriving maximum benefits from applying technology to learning . 
Disruptive technologies come with a caveat . 
They deny students the benefit of personal interactions and learning from inspired teachers , consequent imbibing of values as also the development of inter - personal and communication skills . 
Online instruction supplemented by periodic classroom interaction , or blended MOOCs , could provide a solution for retaining the essential elements of traditional pedagogy . 
Whether through MOOCs or the formal education system , particular emphasis has to be provided by our higher learning institutions on the inculcation of core values in our students . 
Abraham Lincoln had said and I quote : 
" The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next” . 
Our civilization has espoused patriotism , pluralism , tolerance , honesty and discipline as core values . 
Our democracy has thrived on these . 
The next generation must learn to recognize our diversity , inclusiveness and assimilative capacities as inherent sources of strength . 
A society takes the form of a creative enterprise when educated masses , with their interlinked rivers of thoughts and ideas , give rise to a sea of innovations . 
The teacher must encourage the taught to satiate their curiosity , question established knowledge , accept a proposition only after investigation , and pursue ingenuity . 
A scientific temper , which takes one’s imagination beyond the realm of grades and classroom , is essential in our students . 
In particular , the habit of reading and learning through books must be inculcated to sharpen their energetic and inquisitive minds . 
Books also break societal and cultural barriers . Dr . S . Radhakrishnan had said and I quote : " Books are the means by which we build bridges between cultures”
Central universities have an enhanced responsibility in leading the transformative processes of India’s higher education system . 
I am sure under your leadership they will rise to the occasion . 
My Secretary has already explained the format of this Conference . 
I expect innovative solutions to emerge out of your discussions and look forward to the results of your deliberations over these two days . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE BANQUET HOSTED IN HONOUR OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA H . E . MR . BARACK OBAMA
It is a great honour and privilege to welcome you and the First Lady this evening , Mr . President . 
After having had the pleasure of meeting you in such a banquet four years ago during your last visit to India , I am doubly delighted to be able to receive you again - this time , as the host ! 
Excellency , you have made history thrice - over today by becoming the first U . S . President to grace our Republic Day celebration as the Guest of Honour ; by being the first U . S . President to visit India twice while in office ; and by holding a second Summit - level meeting in the shortest - ever time span of four months . 
These milestones make this a truly historical visit . While I am proud that we are creating history together , I am even more pleased that we are creating a brighter future together - for our two countries and the world . 
The relationship between India and the United States is a special one . 
It is special because it is a relationship forged in the hearts and minds of our two people , in the commercial ties between our two businesses , in the exchanges between our two scientists and engineers and in the enduring linkages between hundreds of our institutions . 
This is one relationship where the two Governments can rightfully take pride in acknowledging that they have successfully put in place a ‘Strategic Partnership’ simply by following the lead shown by their people ! 
It is this strong attraction and chemistry that explains why the people of both countries have always viewed each other as friends in every opinion poll ; it also explains why the relationship has consistently enjoyed bipartisan political support . 
This natural sense of kinship stems from the foundational values that both our people cherish deeply – the values of individual liberty and freedom , democracy , diversity and justice . 
These core values not only determine how we live and how we are governed as a nation ; they also define our aspirations for the future and the vision of the world we want to bequeath to our children and grandchildren . 
Excellency , it is this shared vision that forms the solid bedrock of our blossoming relationship . 
Today , our people are collaborating in practically every sphere of human activity - from jointly plumbing the depths of the ocean to understand the Indian monsoon , to joint space exploration in Mars – and everything that lies in between . 
But in a relationship like ours that has infinite potential , there is so much more that we can and should do . 
Excellency , I am glad , therefore , that our countries are deepening strategic , security and defence cooperation to make our two countries , the region and the world a safer place ; the United States in partnering us in our ambitious economic and development agenda through infrastructure development , clean energy solutions , investment , technology , leveraging information technology , education and skilling ; your people are also working with us in setting up Smart Cities , fighting diseases and improving water , health and sanitation . 
Your presence at our cherished Republic Day Parade tomorrow will demonstrate to the world , the growing ties of friendship and trust that bind our two democracies closely . 
As we create new milestones in history and chart new destination points in our shared journey into the future , your visit , Mr President , symbolizes both history and future in the making . 
Excellencies and Distinguished Guests , may I now request you to join me in raising a toast to : 
- The good health of His Excellency President Obama and Her Excellency Mrs . Michelle Obama ; 
- To the continued prosperity and well being of the United States ; and
- To creating new milestones that further strengthen the bonds of friendship and cooperation between India and the United States . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE EVE OF THE REPUBLIC DAY OF INDIA 2015
On the eve of the 66th Republic Day , I extend warm greetings to all of you in India and abroad . I convey my special greetings to members of our Armed Forces , Paramilitary Forces and Internal Security Forces . 
Twenty Sixth January holds an everlasting place in our national memory because it is the day when modern India was born . 
Under Mahatma Gandhi’s moral and political leadership , the National Congress passed thePurna Swaraj resolution demanding complete independence from British rule in December 1929 . 
Gandhiji organized nationwide celebrations on 26 January 1930 as Independence Day . 
From then on , the Nation took a pledge on this day every year to carry on the freedom struggle till we attained it . 
Exactly twenty years later , in 1950 , we adopted our charter of modernity , the Constitution . 
Tragically , Gandhiji had been martyred two years before , but the framework of a Constitution that has made India a role model for today ' s world was constructed out of his philosophy . 
Its essence lay in four principles : democracy ; freedom of faith ; gender equality ; and an economic upsurge for those trapped in the curse of dire poverty . 
These were made Constitutional obligations . 
Gandhiji’s talisman for the country ' s rulers was simple and powerful and I quote : 
" Whenever you are in doubt . . . recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen and ask yourself . . . will it lead to swaraj for the hungry and spiritually starving millions ? " 
Our resolve to eliminate poverty through inclusive development has to be a step in that direction . 
The past year has been remarkable in many ways . Particularly because , after three decades the people have voted to power a single party with a majority for a stable government , and in the process freed the country’s governance from the compulsions of coalition politics . 
Outcome of these Elections has given the mandate to the elected government to fulfill its commitment to the people by using its majority for formulating policies and making laws to implement those policies . 
The voter has played her part ; it is now up to those who have been elected to honour this trust . 
It was a vote for clean , efficient , effective , gender - sensitive , transparent , accountable and citizen - friendly governance . 
There can be no governance without a functioning legislature . 
The legislature reflects the will of the people . 
It is the platform where progressive legislation using civilized dialogue must create delivery mechanisms for realizing the aspirations of the people . 
It calls for reconciling the differences amongst stakeholders and building a consensus for the law to be enacted . 
Enacting laws without discussion impacts the law - making role of the Parliament . 
It breaches the trust reposed in it by the people . This is neither good for the democracy nor for the policies relating to those laws . 
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , Sardar Patel , Subhash Chandra Bose , Bhagat Singh , Rabindranath Tagore , Subramanya Bharati and many more - the vocation and the approach might have been different but they all spoke the same language of patriotism . 
We owe our freedom to these great warriors of nationalism . 
We also salute the unsung heroes who have died securing the liberation of Mother India . 
But it pains me to see that Mother India is not respected by her own children when it comes to the safety of women . 
Atrocities of rape , murders , harassment on the roads , kidnapping and dowry deaths have made women fearful even in their own homes . 
Rabindranath Tagore saw women not only as the deities of the household fire , but also the flame of the soul itself . 
Where have we failed , as parents , teachers and leaders , that our children have forgotten all tenets of decent behaviour and respect for women ? 
We have enacted many legislations but , as Benjamin Franklin had once said and I quote : 
" Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are”
Every Indian must take a pledge to protect the honour of women from violence of any kind . 
Only a nation that respects and empowers its women can become a global power . 
On the eve of India ' s 66th Independence Day on August 14th this year , I had observed that the glass of modern India is more than half - full
I had said that we are equal children before our mother ; and India asks each one of us , in whatever role we play in the complex drama of nation building , to do our duty with integrity , commitment and unflinching loyalty to the values enshrined in our Constitution
If each of us follows this principle , I am confident that India will become a more vibrant , dynamic and prosperous nation . 
The awardees who have been honoured today are being recognised for the passion that they have brought to their work , the excellence which they have achieved and the spirit of enterprise that they have displayed . 
It is these qualities which have enabled them to contribute to significant social change and it is these qualities which all of us should emulate . 
I once again offer my best congratulations to all of them and wish them all success in their future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee to The Delegates of International Conference of Chief Justices of The World on Article 51 of The Constitution of India
I am happy to welcome to the Rashtrapati Bhavan , the distinguished judges and jurists who are taking part in the 13th International Conference of Chief Justices of the World organized in Lucknow by the City Montessori School . 
I am delighted to meet and interact with this gathering of jurists from different legal traditions across the world . 
It is a matter of great happiness that the City Montessori School established 53 years back , has taken the leadership in organizing such Conferences for the last 13 years . 
The theme of this Conference is " Article 51 " of the Constitution of India . 
Article 51 provides that the State will endeavour to promote international peace and security , maintain just and honourable relations between nations and foster respect for international law and encourage settlement of international disputes by arbitration . 
Just a few years before the formulation of Article 51 , India had participated in the negotiations and adoption of the Charter of the United Nations . 
Imprints of the language of the UN Charter can therefore be seen in the formulation of Article 51 . 
Maintaining just and honourable relations between nations and fostering respect for international law is a critical pre - requisite for the promotion of international peace and security . 
Article 51 is a unique provision in the Indian Constitution which mandates the Government to strive for good and friendly relations with foreign countries . 
This Constitutional directive has always been a central element of India ' s foreign policy . 
Article 51 provides international law and treaties and agreements entered into by India with a special status within our country . 
This is reflective of the high respect the Constitution and Indian legal system accords to International Law and the global vision of our Constitution makers . 
This article has been relied upon to introduce and implement various international instruments , particularly the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants on the Political and Civil Rights and the Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in the interpretation of fundamental rights . 
Courts in India have held that by virtue of this Article , international instruments , particularly those to which India is a party , become part of Indian law so long as they are not inconsistent with domestic law . 
The importance of international law in the contemporary world cannot be overemphasized . 
Some of the basic principles enshrined in the UN Charter - such as sovereign equality of states , prohibition of the use of force and protection of the basic human rights , adhered to by all nations , are often under threat or violated . 
There are other challenges for example international terrorism , proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , transnational crimes , illicit drug trafficking , human trafficking and money laundering . 
Global warming and climate change , corruption , poverty and health care are also some other key issues that need to be addressed . 
It is important that States reaffirm their adherence to the rule of law , with a commitment to abide in good faith to an international order based on respect for international law , including obligations under the Charter of United Nations , principles of justice and peaceful co - existence . Jurists such as you have an important role to play in persuading States to abide by the rule of law and building support amongst the public for the same . 
No country in the world can afford to ignore the basic tenets of international law , as a just world order is only possible by adherence to international rule of law . 
Today , international law touches every aspect of human life . 
Due to rapid technological advancements , the world has become smaller . 
This necessitates the need for finding common approaches to counter problems of environmental degradation , cross - boarder terrorism , international trade , human rights and utilization of resources beyond national jurisdictions culminating into international rules . 
With increasing globalization and inter dependence , States have to cooperate and act together to ensure improved access not only to food , health care , education and housing for their citizens but also act to protect them against crime , violence and aggression in which individuals can prosper and society develop . 
Being the largest functional democracy in the world , India believes in promotion of democratic values and processes . 
We have consistently played an important role in seeking international consensus to tackle major global issues and foster international cooperation and collaboration . 
India remains committed to work with partners to make the world safe for our children and banish poverty so that each one has the option and facilities to realize his or her potential . 
India also believes that advancement of the rule of law at the national level is an essential tool for the protection of democracy , economic growth , sustainable development , ensuring gender justice , eradication of poverty and hunger and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
I am aware that one of the subjects you have been discussing is the establishment of a World Government . 
However , what we have at present is the United Nations Organization . 
All countries and citizens of the world must do their utmost to support and strengthen the UN
As a founder member of the United Nations , India supports the purposes and principles of the UN , as embodied in its Charter . 
India has made significant contributions to implementing the goals of the Charter , and the evolution of the UN ' s specialized programmes and agencies . 
India has worked for enhancing international cooperation in the areas of counter - terrorism , prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to non - state actors , and the strengthening of UN peacekeeping and peace building efforts . 
In view of the serious threat posed to international maritime trade and security by piracy off the coast of some countries , India has promoted concerted international cooperation against the pirates . 
India is the third largest troop contributor with over 8000 troops deployed all over the world in 10 peacekeeping missions in Democratic Republic of Congo , Lebanon , Golan Heights , Liberia , Cote d ' Ivoire , Cyprus , East Timor , Haiti and South Sudan . 
Over the decades , India has urged the UN to play a more active role and be more effective in pursuing a more equitable international order and an economic environment that is conducive to rapid economic growth and development in developing countries . 
In the context of the new globalized system , India has also actively urged the UN to work to ensure that developing countries can harness the benefits of these processes in an equitable manner . 
Specifically , India has emphasized the need for enhanced flows of official development assistance ( ODA ) to developing countries - - in particular , raising ODA from developed countries to 0 . 7 % of their Gross National Income - transfer of technology to developing countries , more equitable terms of trade , accelerating industrialization , agricultural development and food security in developing countries . 
India strongly advocates the process of reform and restructuring of the UN to equip it to more effectively respond to the evolving needs of its membership . 
Objective realities underscore the need for thorough - going and genuine UN reform : it is an organization that is over six decades old ; its membership has expanded by nearly four times since the Charter was signed ; and the world of today is very different from the world of 1945 . 
The challenges of the 21st century - political , economic , social , environmental or demographic - are global in nature , and the world is far more interconnected and interdependent than at any time in human history . 
This demands a greater dependence on the UN as the only democratic , universal forum for the community of nations . 
It necessitates comprehensive reform of the UN , aimed at its revitalization . 
India believes that the UN should be able to respond to the needs and priorities of member States , particularly developing countries , which constitute the vast majority of its membership . 
India believes that no reform of the UN will be complete without the reform and expansion of the UN Security Council . 
It is essential that the Security Council is expanded in both the permanent and non - permanent categories . 
The inclusion of developing countries from Asia , Africa and Latin America , who are capable of global responsibility , will contribute to optimal decision making necessary to address the insecurity of developing countries . 
By any objective criteria , such as population , territorial size , GDP , economic potential , civilizational legacy , cultural diversity , political system and past and ongoing contributions to the activities of the UN - especially to UN peacekeeping operations - India is eminently suited for permanent membership of the UN Security Council . 
India has affirmed its willingness and capacity to shoulder the responsibilities of permanent membership of the UN Security Council . 
I thank all the distinguished delegates for having taken the time and effort to visit India . 
I compliment the City Montessori School , for the good work done in spreading the message of world peace and encourage the school to continue its efforts in this regard , especially with a focus on children and the youth . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on sustainable housing for masses at Annual Convention of NAREDCO
It gives me great pleasure to be here amidst you this morning for the 11th National Convention of National Real Estate Development Council . 
This meeting is indeed important as it will debate strategies and road maps for sustainable housing for the masses of our country who are facing acute shortage of this basic necessity . 
The pressure on housing sector can be expected to chart the northern vector in the coming decades with urbanization in the country growing at a fast pace . 
Having grown nearly 32 % in the decade ending 2011 , the urban population is expected to be around 600 million by 2030 in a century which would see the majority of the people of this world living in cities . 
The urbanization in the developing world is virtually unstoppable particularly in India which is one of the fastest growing economies in the world . 
This is for the reason that countries urbanize rapidly when economies grow faster . 
It is attributable to factors such as industrial and service sectors concentrating in and around urban areas due to better access to material inputs , larger concentration of consumers , better networking opportunities spawned by knowledge sharing , skilled manpower and globalisation . 
All these factors would induce larger migration of people to the cities in search of new avenues of employment . 
With densification of economic activities in urban areas , these centers would increase in importance as focal points or hubs of economic growth . 
Consequently , the share of the contribution of the urban areas to India ' s GDP is expected to reach 75 - 80 percent by the middle of the century . 
Therefore , managing the challenges associated with this phenomenon is not only important for the economic prosperity of the nation but also from the social perspective . 
To manage and reap the benefits of urbanization , it is imperative that we provide the basic urban infrastructure such as housing , roads , water , electricity , sewage , sanitation , transportation , education and healthcare in these " city regions " . 
We have several large cities such as Mumbai , Delhi , Chennai and Kolkata . 
Neglect of such concentrations can result in urban chaos leading to deceleration in economic growth and law and order problems . 
We would , therefore , need to lay emphasis on urban governance , planning and financing . 
It would also be necessary to explore the possibility of developing secondary cities and towns by encouraging private investments with the Government playing a support role to provide infrastructural facilities to divert part of the migration from the larger concentrations . 
The Government has taken several measures to address challenges in urban sector . 
The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission , launched by Government of India in 2005 to undertake urban infrastructure development and provision of basic services to urban poor is one amongst them . 
This has yielded some dividends , but more needs to be done to achieve synergy in partnership schemes with the private sector using PPP models . 
Government schemes alone cannot address the problems , the private sector which would also benefit from well managed urban centers have an important role to play in this direction . 
The less affluent economic groups face the brunt of the housing shortages . 
On the basis of the 2011 census , a Technical group set up by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation has estimated that the total shortage in housing is 18 . 78 million in 2012 and of this 95 percent is in the Economically Weaker Section ( EWS ) and Low Income Group ( LIG ) categories . 
This has led to approximately 25 percent of urban population living in slums and squatter settlements . 
The Government is seized of this reality and has launched the Rajiv Awas Yojana in 2009 to provide houses to slum dwellers with title certificates . 
Mortgage Guarantee Fund and Interest Subsidy Schemes have been launched to safeguard the interest of bankers and help beneficiaries . 
This is a major and significant step that has been taken by the Government to resolve the housing problem of the urban poor . 
But as I have just emphasized , the private sector would have to take more initiatives to find sustainable solutions . 
The Government is taking steps to encourage private developers by making affordable housing construction attractive through direct and indirect incentives . 
Weighted deduction of 150 percent on capital expenditure u / s 35AD , External Commercial Borrowing and Service Tax exemption on affordable housing projects are some of the incentives that I had the opportunity to announce in my last budget as the Finance Minister . 
As you all know , there are major problems that bedevil the efforts of the low income groups become homeowners . 
Significant among them is the difficulty in extending credit to this segment of the population through the banking channels . 
While HIG and MIG segments have been able to reap the benefits of the low rate mortgage loans and deductions available under the Income Tax Act , and home loan disbursement has gone up many fold , the EWS and LIG households have been left behind . 
Banks are generally reluctant to lend to them because of the perceived risk of the loans becoming non - performing assets . 
I am confident that banks would rise to the occasion to face this challenge and evolve innovative methods to allow greater credit flow to this segment . 
I hope that Mortgage Guarantee Fund and Interest Subsidy Scheme , launched recently , will make the credit flow to these segments easy . 
Another challenge this sector is facing is the shortage of land . Land is limited and accounts for upto 90 % of the cost of house in metros . 
Both the Government and the private sector should look at ways to augment land supply for housing . 
One way may be to look at acquisition of land in adjoining areas of urban agglomerations and connect them to the city centers through rapid mass transportation systems . 
Simultaneously , it should also be ensured that available land mass is utilized optimally by revisiting planning norms . 
In addition , it should also be ensured that all the housing projects have schemes for low - income groups . 
This should be made a part of town - planning strategy . 
The importance of this requirement cannot be exaggerated as the economically weaker sections provide the kinds of services without which urban agglomerations cannot have a healthy existence . 
These centers require services of taxi drivers , maids , cleaners etc . 
Through this , inclusive growth can be encouraged not only as an existential requirement of agglomerations , but also as a social need .

SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF INAUGURATION OF BEACH FESTIVAL “FESTA DE DIU”
Dear Guests , Ladies and Gentlemen
It is a matter of joy for me to be present amongst you for the inauguration of " Festa de Diu” . 
It is really a festival time here . 
Arriving in Diu , I could feel the festive mood of the people , tourists and the City . 
Winters in Diu , I am told , are very pleasant and enjoyable . 
With clear and blue sea on one side , the setting is perfect for the festival . 
I must compliment the Administration for conceptualizing this unique beach festival , one of its kind in India and Asia . 
This is my first visit to this Union Territory and I must admit that this pristine island destination presents a serene spectacle , inspiring a profound sense of calmness . 
Diu may be geographically small , but it holds immense possibilities to draw tourists from all parts of India and indeed the world . 
I must congratulate the UT Administration and the residents of Diu for their efforts to make the city clean and ready for the grand beach festival . 
India is known world over for the richness and diversity of its culture . 
Each part of India has a distinct cultural milieu which has evolved over centuries . 
Today , as I was watching the fascinating Siddhi Dhamal dance , I could not help but reflect on the manner in which civilizations have mingled over millennia . 
The dance of this special tribe is the perfect manifestation of the confluence of cultures which binds the people of India and Africa together . 
Those were the days when sailors would set out from the Eastern seashore of Africa , across the Indian Ocean and reach the western shores of India . 
Diu was once a thriving port and traders from Gujarat would carry textiles to Africa and return with Gold and Ivory . 
In that age , our people were connected by ideas , culture and trade . 
Historically Diu also has a special significance for the Parsis as it was in Diu that they first landed in India . 
This ethos of acceptance and assimilation has defined the Indian civilization and made it a melting pot of the world . 
We must nurture and preserve this spirit which has made our country a rich amalgam of multiple cultures . 
The Union Territory of Daman & Diu has a distinct heritage which makes it special part of India . 
I recall that in 1961 Operation Vijay was launched by the Indian Army to liberate this territory from the colonial rule . 
The whole nation felt a sense of pride as the people of this territory became part of the Indian Union along with Goa . 
The journey of the people of Daman & Diu in the last five decades has seen much progress and development . 
It’s advancement in Infrastructure and Industrialization is noteworthy . 
It is heartening to learn that the UT Administration has taken concrete measures in the area of solar power generation in Diu . 
I am informed that Diu is striving to become the first city in the country to be completely run on solar energy . 
This would be a model which other cities in the country could aspire for . 
A modern cycle track which has been constructed in Diu is also a positive step towards green mobility . 
Being a small island territory which is blessed with such a beauty , tourism has to be a key driver of the economy and a source of livelihood . 
I am happy to note the concrete measures taken by the Administration to give a boost to tourism . 
I am told that the enhanced air connectivity , with Air India commencing its operations , will give a major boost to tourism opportunities in the territory . 
I feel that Diu can become a tourism gateway for southern Gujarat and Diu - Somnath - Gir are a natural tourism circuit . 
Better connectivity and collaboration with Gujarat tourism will provide a greater fillip to the immense opportunities in this sector . 
The Saurashtra region of Gujarat is also full of vibrant cultural and folk traditions and a boost to Diu tourism will also have a multiplier effect for development of tourism in the Saurashtra region . 
Organizing special cultural festivals such as these would be a source of encouragement for the Indian folk and classical artists and ensure that our youth stay connected with our cultural traditions . 
I am informed that last year nearly 17 lakh tourists visited Diu and with the consistent efforts of administration , this is likely to touch 25 lakh this year . 
Diu has a unique locational advantage , blessed as it is with the bounty of nature . 
Thousands of small fishermen depend on the ocean for their livelihood . 
I am informed that the administration is taking measures for modernizing the fishing harbor at Diu . 
I would also suggest that we explore the possibilities of greater value addition so that they get a better value for their catch . I’m told that the Ministry of Earth Sciences plans to set up a world class oceanarium at Diu . 
This will boost the two primary sectors of local economy – fisheries and tourism . 
While planning for the development of the region , the aspirations of the youth will also have to be taken care of . 
Providing modern education , skill development and adequate and decent job opportunities should be one of the goals of the administration . 
In the end , I would once again welcome everybody to the start of the Festa de Diu and wish the festival a grand success . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF SHILPGURU AWARDS AND NATIONAL AWARDS TO MASTER CRAFTSPERSONS FOR 2012 , 2013 & 2014
It is really happy occasion for me to be present amidst you today for conferring the prestigious National Awards & Shilp Guru Awards to outstanding master craftspersons for the years 2012 , 2013 & 2014 . 
I would like to first of all congratulate the award winners and master craftspersons . 
I also place on record my appreciation for their unique contribution to the preservation and promotion of Indian handicraft traditions and for enriching the cultural heritage of our country . 
Our indigenous handicrafts are a cherished aspect of our way of life . 
Their extensive range reflects our nation’s diversity and infinite creativity . 
Each geographic region and sub - region has its individual style and tradition that stems from the ancient life - rhythms of its society . 
Our shilpkaars have , down the centuries , developed their own , often unique , methods and techniques of bringing life into stone and metal , sandalwood and clay . 
They had , many centuries ago , perfected scientific and engineering processes far ahead of their times . 
The creations of that time reveal their sophisticated knowledge and highly developed aesthetic sense . 
Production of handicraft items provides livelihood opportunities to millions of people living in rural areas . 
Handicrafts entail low capital investment and facilitate environmental conservation . 
They also empower disadvantaged segments like the Scheduled Castes , Scheduled Tribes , Other Backward Classes and minorities thus making development inclusive and sustainable . 
Production of handicraft items holds particular significance in the economic empowerment of women living in the rural areas , as production is carried out in the house alongside other household chores . 
Women form a large part of the work force and constitute more than half of the artisan sector . 
It is estimated that over 70 lakh people are earning their livelihood from production of handicrafts and related activities . 
Exports of handicrafts , excluding handmade carpets , constituted 11 % of total exports and grew from Rs . 23 , 504 crore in 2013 - 14 to Rs . 27 , 747 crore in 2014 - 15 . 
Handmade carpets constituted 3 % of the total exports from India and their value increased from Rs . 7 , 110 crore in 2013 - 14 to Rs . 8 , 442 crore in 2014 - 15 representing a 19 % growth , year - on - year . 
Artmetal wares , wood wares , imitation jewellery , embroidered & crocheted goods and hand printed textiles & scarves constitute the bulk of our handicraft exports . 
It is indeed a matter of satisfaction that handicraft exports , including handmade carpets , registered an impressive increase during 2014 - 15 , rising from Rs . 30 , 614 crore to Rs . 36 , 189 crore . 
The domestic market is also shaping up well given the growth in the urban middle class . 
However , inspite of these healthy growth figures , the handicraft industry in India is highly fragmented and the sector has been facing significant challenges mainly due to lack of design , innovation , technology upgradation , scarcity of raw materials , inadequate finance and increased competition from mill and factory made products . 
I am , therefore , pleased to learn that various schemes for development of the handicrafts sector have been reviewed and a comprehensive National Handicraft Development programme launched . 
The programme emphasizes an integrated approach for development of handicraft clusters . 
The major thrust is on result oriented interventions focusing on empowering artisans through skill and technology upgradation , design development and supply of raw materials through easily accessible common facility centres at cluster level . 
Developing and strengthening marketing linkages through various options such as direct sale , participation in sale expos and e - commerce is another major component of the new approach . 
Information technology is also being utilized to provide assistance to artisans directly through Aadhar linked bank accounts . 
To provide a fillip to this sector , it is necessary that we take concerted steps at various levels . 
These may include , for example , facilitation of easier access to credit from banks and other financial institutions and the promotion of these products in domestic and foreign markets . 
Universities , Corporate houses and Government departments can contribute by sponsoring and also undertaking research which results in new and innovative technologies that will enable upgradation of the traditional tools and designs of local artisans . 
The plan to set up a Hastkala Academy is a welcome step in this direction . 
Our " guru shishya parampara” is an exceptional aspect of our traditional arts and crafts . 
Master - craftsmen , down the ages , have taken pride in passing on their skills to their succeeding generations . 
I can do no better than quote Gandhiji who had said , " if we want to keep all seven lakhs of our villages alive and not only a fraction of them , we have to revive our village handicrafts . 
And you may be sure that if we impart scholastic training through those crafts , we can bring about a revolution” ( unquote ) . 
Conferring the National Awards and Shilpguru Awards today is a recognition of the outstanding contributions of our artisans who have through their creativity carved out a niche for India and its products worldwide . 
The eighty craftspersons who are the proud recipients of these Awards richly deserve this honour . I once again take this opportunity to congratulate the awardees , and the entire handicrafts community , for their creative efforts and wish them the very best in their future endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF SIXTY SECOND CONVOCATION OF GUJARAT VIDYAPITH
It is my privilege to be here today for the sixty - second convocation of Gujarat Vidyapith . 
This historic institution was founded in 1920 by Mahatma Gandhi , who was its Chancellor since inception and remained so till he breathed last . 
Dr . Rajendra Prasad became the Chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith after Gandhiji and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel . 
After him , the legacy was inherited by Morarji Desai , who served the longest term as Chancellor for 33 years . 
The previous Chancellor Nararyan Desai was the son of Mahadev Desai , who spent his childhood and early youth with Gandhiji . 
Let me congratulate the graduating students orsnataks as Gandhiji would have liked to call them . 
I am aware that some of my predecessors have graced this occasion in the past . 
I consider it a special responsibility being amongst you all and addressing the graduating students of this unique seat of learning . 
More so as , before coming here , I had the occasion to spend some time at the Sabarmati Ashram that Bapu had set up in 1917 . 
Even now , the environment of the Ashram reverberates with the spirit ofSatyagrahaand constructive programme of yester - years . 
Gandhiji was a great soul who showed the world thatSatyagrahaor the Force of Truth andAhimsaor Non - Violence can be marshalled to create a more just world . 
Gandhi was a rare visionary . He created this university , which is going to complete one hundred years soon , because he realized that education and education of youth was a sound way to form the new world . 
It is heartening to find Gandhiji’s ideals well - entrenched in this institution as it marches ahead in imparting higher education . 
It today offers 12 courses at the graduation level , 9 at post - graduation , and 20 at M . Phil stage , besides diploma and certificate courses . 
Gujarat Vidyapith has made good progress in imparting education in contemporary subjects like microbiology , computer science and energy technologies . 
At a time when higher education is becoming increasingly costly , this Vidyapith has become an institution of choice for youth from the underprivileged sections , with 80 percent of the students’ enrolled belonging to these backgrounds . 
That 40 percent of the student population comprises girls is an encouraging sign . 
The state and the society at large ought to continue supporting such a noble organization . 
For social reconstruction , Gandhiji had propounded the principle of Nai Talim which states that knowledge and work are not separate . 
The constituents of Nai Talim are the 3 - H : heart , hand and head . 
To put this philosophy into practice , Gandhiji promoted an academic curriculum of ‘basic education for all’ . 
With ashram shalas and buniyadi schools operating in the remote areas , Gujarat is perhaps the only state where Nai Talim exists in an institutional form . 
Nai Talim infers charitra nirman or character building , whose relevance is increasing by the day . 
Without doubt , learning with value - orientation must guide our approach in education . 
Gujarat Vidyapith provides education aimed at building the character , competence , culture and conscientiousness in students . 
This is needed to regenerate the country according to Gandhian ideals . 
This institution has been specially mandated to educate youth for Gram Swaraj , which is a laudable goal espoused by Gandhiji . 
He firmly held that India lived in her villages . 
Despite growing urbanization , 68 percent of the country’s population still resides in rural areas . 
Intervention in food security , education , skill development , employment , technology dissemination , health and nutrition , housing , drinking water , and sanitation would go a long way to uplift the quality of rural life and address poverty concerns . 
I am told students of this institute are oriented and trained to support rural development in line with Gandhiji’s vision . Initiatives such as this would help create self - reliant villages and achieve equity as well as economic and environmental sustainability . 
This , according to me , will lead to a Samarth Bharat . 
As a country , we have promised ourselves aSwachh Bharat by 2nd October , 2019 to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji . 
It is noteworthy that students of this institute through their own labour have kept the campus clean . 
Such traditions in community life are not built in a day . 
Hence , it must be the endeavour of each one of you to proliferate this noble practice outside . Swachh Bharat , according to Bapu , implied a clean mind , clean body and clean environment . 
Every citizen has a duty to rededicate themselves to create a clean external and internal environment of self and society to makeSwachh Bharatpossible . 
I am certain you will make ideal citizens who will endeavour to keep our countrySwachhand make itSamarth . 
Gandhiji in life and in death struggled for communal harmony . 
Educating in peace and harmony is the key to contain and reorient the disruptive forces in society . 
The motto of Gujarat Vidyapith is " Sa Vidya Ya Vimuktaye” , that is " Education that Liberates” . 
The students of Gujarat Vidyapith are not only learning Gandhian thought as a subject , but they are being provided exposure to world religions as well . 
This institute should continue to demonstrate that it is by educating the heart and mind of the youth that social rejuvenation on the path of non - violence is possible . 
In this context , I compliment Gujarat Vidyapith for having brought out a digital version of the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi in collaboration with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting . 
This will enable wider dissemination of Gandhian thought and philosophy amongst people . 
The higher education sector in India faces numerous challenges today . 
On the one hand , there is need for increasing access and making education affordable . 
On the other , there is need to ensure quality and pursue excellence . 
These are not contradictory objectives but complementary goals . 
Quality consciousness must be at the back of every initiative in our higher academic institutions . 
Many meritorious students leave the shores of our country and study abroad due to lack of institutes in India conforming to high standards of education . 
Not many international students come to India for higher studies either . 
It is a worrying sign that the number of students from seven out of the top eight countries in this respect – US , Germany , France , South Korea , Australia , China and Singapore – have dipped 73 percent in 2014 * . 
We must do all at our end to reverse this trend and make India emerge as a quality and affordable education destination for students outside . 
The developmental challenges faced by our country call for an inspired response from the higher education system . 
Quality and relevant research can help tide over our socio - economic problems . 
To build a research eco - system , we need to adopt a multi - disciplinary approach , promote research at under - graduate level and develop scientific temper in the students . 
Due thrust on innovation is required to transform novel ideas into ‘viable - cum - enviable products’ . 
Despite focused attention on innovation in recent years , India lags behind many countries on this front . 
At 81st position in the Global Innovation Index 2015 , we have much ground to cover . 
An efficient set - up for mentoring innovative ideas and nurturing grassroots innovations could see our country surge ahead in innovation . 
India is home to a large population of the young . 
Demographic dividend can occur only if greater number of competent and skilled professionals is produced by our higher educational and technical institutions . 
This calls for skill development initiatives on a massive scale . 
For that , cooperation amongst our institutes is necessary . 
Technology must be leveraged to bring greater number of youth in the skill net . 
Massive Open Online Courses ( MOOCs ) has become a preferred mode of learning due to its merits of scale , speed and cost . 
Interactive MOOCs can offer vocational aspirants equal opportunity to learn . 
Such an initiative can revolutionize delivery of skills knowledge and revamp vocational education in the country . 
Skilling efforts would also call for fusion of traditional technology with cutting - edge technology . 
I am told that Gujarat Vidyapith educates students incharkha and computer with equal enthusiasm . 
The students here are imbibed with the spirit of ‘dignity of labour’ . 
I am sure they will put their training to good use and become worthy citizens of our nation . 
As you leave the portals of your alma mater , remember to use your education effectively . 
Apply the Gandhian principles at every stage of your life . With the distinct training ofHeart , Hand and Head which is Nai Talim , the onus is on you to construct aSamarth Bharat . 
I wish everyone gathered here the very best for the future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF INAUGURATION OF THE ARCHIVES AND RESEARCH CENTRE AT SABARMATI ASHRAM
I am happy to visit Sabarmati Ashram today and inaugurate this new Archives and Research Centre . 
I have in the past often sat on this platform of Hriday Kunj , which is a special place . 
Hriday Kunj was the sparse dwelling of a frail man who brought a mighty empire to its knees . 
Every time I come here , I have gone away with renewed hope and faith . 
Friends , we live in times when the world needs Gandhiji more than ever . 
The Archives and Research Centre of the Ashram which I inaugurated today is a concrete effort to conserve and disseminate Gandhiji’s legacy . 
The responsibility we shoulder to spread his word and message is more pressing now than ever before . 
Hriday Kunj both inspires and challenges us . 
It tells what one man’s dedication , determination and ideals can achieve . 
At the same time , it also reminds us of the road we still need to traverse in order to realise Gandhiji’s dream of an India free from want , oppression and injustice . 
This is a hallowed place which each one of us should visit again and again to draw strength and launch forth in the task of building the India that our founding fathers envisioned and made provision for in our great Constitution . 
Gandhiji is not just the Father of our Nation . 
He was also the maker of our Nation . 
He gave us the moral vector to guide our actions , a measure by which we are judged . 
Gandhiji saw India as an inclusive nation where every section of our population lived in equality and enjoyed equal opportunity . 
He saw India as a country which would celebrate and constantly strengthen its vibrant diversity and commitment to pluralism . 
Gandhiji wanted our people to move forward unitedly in ever widening thought and action . 
And most of all , he did not want us to convert the celebration of his life and message into a mere ritual . 
Gandhiji taught us to be morally innovative . 
If India leads in moral innovation , all other forms of creativity which we have in abundance - would automatically fulfil the Talisman that Gandhiji gave us , namely , wiping every tear from each eye . 
When I paid my homage to Mahatma Gandhi by placing the Sutar Aanti , I read the rare hymn composed by him in honour of the Daridra Narayan , the Poor as God . It reads : 
Lord of humility , dwelling in the little pariah hut , help us to search for Thee throughout that fair land watered by Ganges Brahmaputra and Jumna . 
Give us receptiveness , 
Give us the open heartedness , 
Give us Thy humility , 
Give us the ability and willingness
To identify ourselves with the masses of India . 
O God , who does help only when man feels utterly humble
Grant that we may not be isolated from the people
We would serve as servants and friends . 
Let us be embodiments of self - sacrifice , embodiments of godliness , humility personified , that we may know the land better , And love it more . 
I think each and every Indian should meditate upon its meaning and significance . 
The real essence of Gandhiji’s legacy and its continuing resonance lies in his injunction to us that all our actions must keep in mind the last person . 
The last person in India is often a woman , a Dalit or an Adivasi . 
We must constantly ask ourselves , do our actions have meaning for them ? 
The " Tryst with Destiny” that Pandit Nehru spoke of was this obligation . 
We must empower the poorest of the poor . 
Everyone must act as Trustees of collective welfare and wealth . 
The essence of being human is our trust of each other . 
The damage we see to the environment all around us - reminds us of the need for Trusteeship . 
Every day , we see unprecedented violence all around us . 
At the heart of this violence is darkness , fear and mistrust . 
While we invent new modes of combating this ever spiralling violence , we must not forget the power of non - violence , dialogue and reason . 
Ahimsa is not a negative force . 
It is not just non - injury . 
Ahimsa is that moral possibility which can dispel the darkness and make us aglow with light . 
Gurudev Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi were bearers of this light and that light must continue to guide us . 
Those who abide in Truth , those who are devotees of Truth as God , of Satya Narayan , do not take lives of others , but sacrifice their own . 
Gandhiji gave us an object lesson in Ahimsa by taking the assassin’s bullets with the name of Rama on his lips . 
We must free our public discourse of all forms of violence , physical as well as verbal . 
Only a non - violent society can ensure the participation of all sections of the people , especially the marginalised and the dispossessed in our democratic process . 
The real dirt of India lies not in our streets but in our minds and in our unwillingness to let go of views that divide society into " them” and " us” , " pure” and " impure” . 
We must make a success of the laudable and welcome Swatch Bharat Mission . 
However , this also must be seen as just the beginning of a much larger and intense effort to cleanse minds and fulfil Gandhiji’s vision in all its aspects . 
Gandhiji would tell us – and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar would agree with him - that so long as untouchability persists , so long as dehumanising practice of carrying night soil persists , we cannot have real Swacch Bharat . 
Gandhiji insisted on the dignity of all human labour and expressed his desire to be a scavenger . 
We must remember that Gandhiji wished to be a scavenger of our hearts as much as of our villages . 
Gandhiji enunciated some of the finest principles of democratic life that should at all times regulate relations of citizens and their government . 
He said and I quote : " The highest form of freedom carries with it the greatest measure of discipline and humility . 
Freedom that comes from discipline and humility cannot be denied ; unbridled licence is a sign of vulgarity injurious alike to self and one ' s neighbours . " 
Gandhiji wrote to Gurudev Tagore . 
I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed . 
I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible . 
But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any . 
Sabarmati Ashram was such a place in his days . 
Only those who are confident of their conviction , secure in their faith and rooted in their culture can hope to live in an open house , an open society . 
If we close ourselves in , seek to be immune from other influences , it shows that we are prepared to live in a house that is devoid of fresh breeze . 
Hriday Kunj’s lesson to us in contemporary India is that we must build an open society ever ready to engage with diverse ideas and thoughts on equal terms . 
Friends , Gandhiji was an advocate of knowledge without barriers . 
Gandhiji’s life should be understood as a whole , not piecemeal , and certainly not fragmented . 
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru alerted us a few years after Gandhiji’s demise
A new generation grows up to whom he is almost a name , a great name to be revered , but nevertheless a name . 
Within a few more years there will not be many left who have come in personal contact with him and had experience of that vivid , virile and magnificent personality . 
The legend will grow and take many shapes , sometimes with little truth in it . 
Our intangible heritage lies in our systems of thought , in ideas that are unique to this land but not exclusive to us , as they seek to embrace not only humanity but life itself . 
The Institutions founded by Gandhiji and those charged with the responsibility of conservation , preservation and dissemination of his heritage must take the lead in this regard . 
Debate and research on Gandhiji must be supported by placing in the public domain authenticated versions of Gandhiji’s writings . 
The Ashram must partner with other archives in the country and overseas to create Digital Commons on the life and thought of Gandhiji . 
I convey my good wishes to the team of the Sabarmati Ashram who have conceptualised and created this archives and research centre . 
A memorial like the Ashram must remain always alive to the expectations that this nation has from it and be willing and capable of assuming new roles . 
It must remain forever relevant in the imagination of the people . 
Friends , Gandhiji’s favourite Bhajan was being sung this morning as I entered Hriday Kunj . 
This immortal hymn of Narsinh Mehta says that the true devotee is one who is compassionate and moved by empathy for others . 
This capacity for compassion and empathy is the true foundation of our civilisation . 
Gandhiji used a very special word for civilisation , SUDHAR . SUDHAR is not just the good path or the right path but also that which holds human civilisation together . 
Let us pledge to join hands and build an India that truly exemplifies this SUDHAR . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF AMUL’S CATTLE FEED MANUFACTURING PLANT
It is my privilege to be here today to inaugurate the state - of - the - art cattle feed manufacturing plant of AMUL . 
At the outset , let me congratulate AMUL for achieving yet another milestone in its illustrious journey . 
I am also glad to have this opportunity to visit Gujarat , a vibrant state which has shown the way forward for comprehensive socio - economic development . 
Gujarat is a historical land having major sites dating back to the ancient Indus Valley Civilization . 
Lothal is considered to be one of the earliest seaports in the world . 
Coastal cities like Bharuch and Khambat were important trading centres in the Maurya and Gupta empires . 
Gujarat played a leading role in India’s freedom struggle . 
Some of the tallest leaders of the movement belonged to this region . 
The Sabarmati Ashram of Mahatma Gandhi served as the nerve centre of the freedom movement . 
Gujarat has progressed on all fronts after independence . 
This has been possible due to the industrious and enterprising nature of the Gujarati people . 
The state has some of the largest industrial corporations while its agricultural growth is amongst the highest in the country . 
It is the forerunner of the cooperative movement in the dairy sector . 
On this occasion , I pay my tribute to great leaders like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel , Morarji Desai , Tribhuvandas Patel and Dr . Verghese Kurien for their guidance and leadership in the AMUL co - operative movement . 
I also acknowledge the tremendous contribution of the 3 . 6 million farmers of AMUL family ; and salute the 150 million Indian milk producers for their efforts toward nation - building . 
It is your dedication , ingenuity , sacrifice and hard work that have ensured food security for our country in the critical area of milk and dairy products . 
Before the beginning of cooperatives in the dairy sector , the milk marketing system was controlled by contractors and middlemen . 
In the absence of any sellers’ union , it was a buyers’ market where dairy farmers were forced to sell milk at throwaway prices . 
In 1945 , the Bombay Milk Scheme was started under which the Government of Bombay entered into an agreement with a private dairy unit - Polson’s - to supply milk from Anand in Kaira district to Bombay after pasteurizing . 
The arrangement was satisfactory to all parties except the farmers for whom the exploitative conditions at the hands of milk contractors continued . 
On the advice of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel , and the efforts of Morarji Desai , milk producers’ co - operative societies were organized to collect milk from their member - farmers . 
A fifteen - day milk strike when not a drop of milk was sold to the milk merchants turned successful . 
Union Limited , Anand , or AMUL Dairy - that was formally registered on December 14 , 1946 . 
Its objective was to provide proper marketing facilities for the milk producers of the district . 
AMUL Dairy began pasteurizing milk in June 1948 for the Bombay Milk Scheme with a handful of farmers in two village co - operative societies producing about 250 litres a day . 
However by the end of 1948 , 432 farmers had joined village societies . The quantity of milk handled by AMUL Dairy increased to 5 , 000 litres a day . 
On October 31 , 1964 , Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri came to Anand to inaugurate the first cattle feed plant of AMUL . 
He preferred to spend a night in a village at Kheda district interacting with farmers . 
The prevailing milk shortage in the country and import dependence for dairy commodities prompted him to replicate the AMUL model on a much wider scale . 
A national body – the National Dairy Development Board ( NDDB ) – was created to draw up a dairy development programme . 
This task was entrusted to Dr . Verghese Kurien who was then managing AMUL . 
Due to the untiring efforts of Dr . Kurien and his team , " Operation Flood” as the initiative was called , became the largest dairy development programme in the world . 
It was , therefore , the AMUL movement that steered our nation towards prominence on the global dairy map , making India the world’s largest milk producer . 
AMUL Dairy is now a group under the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation . 
This apex marketing body has 3 . 6 million dairy farmers in Gujarat with an average daily milk procurement of 16 million litres and annual turnover of over 22 , 000 crore rupees . 
AMUL is today the largest liquid milk brand in Asia and the largest food brand in India . It is also India’s largest exporter of dairy products . 
To my mind , AMUL personifies the spirit of selfless dedication and far - sighted leadership . 
Though your journey since 1946 from a ‘drop’ to a ‘flood’ of milk was challenging , it was made possible because of your ability to be sensitive and proactive to the needs of farmers and being dynamic to the changing circumstances . 
The institutional structure called ‘AMUL Model’ or ‘Anand Pattern’ that emerged from the dairy cooperative movement created a billion rupees worth brand while embracing the poorest of poor farmers . 
Through logistics innovation , AMUL has ensured easy availability of high - quality , packaged milk and dairy products across the country . 
As the entire value - chain from milk production and processing to marketing is owned and controlled by dairy farmers or farmer - owned institutions , this model has ensured remunerative prices for the farmers and has insulated them from price fluctuations . 
In the last one year , the sharp decline in global dairy commodity prices has reduced milk prices to dairy farmers by 20 to 50 percent worldwide . 
In pleasant contrast I am told , farmers associated with AMUL Dairy have received higher prices for the milk they have poured into their cooperative . 
These efforts have brought smiles in the faces of Indian farmers , improving their quality of life while meeting the nutritional requirements of the nation . 
AMUL Dairy from the very beginning has been a trend - setter in adopting improved technology . 
Breakthrough dairy technology enabled AMUL to spray - dry buffalo milk into products such as cheese , butter , condensed milk and baby food . For the health and well - being of the cattle population , it started a mobile veterinary dispensary in 1950 . 
For meeting the nutritional requirements of cattle , it established the cattle feed plant in 1964 where the technology of cattle feed in pellet form ensured its efficient usage . 
Dairy is one sector where cooperative efforts complemented by Government support have worked wonders . 
For instance , the long distance transportation of milk in India has been made possible through the National Milk Grid . 
This process innovation has helped liquid milk and milk products find better markets in the country . 
The Government has now prioritized its support for the dairy sector through a National Dairy Plan , being managed by NDDB . 
Given that the productivity of our milch animals is still low compared to global standards , an outlay of 2 , 242 crore rupees will be invested in the first phase of the plan . 
It is expected that the resultant growth in milk production will fully meet the estimated growth in demand for milk and milk products in our country . 
In this context , I recollect what Dr . Kurien had once said and I quote : While we have been largely left alone to manage our business , various governments have also played an extremely supportive role . 
However , for the cooperative sector to flourish in the entire country , the Union and State governments can further help by providing a level - playing field , in terms of their macro - economic policies . 
It is imperative for our policy - makers to recognize that cooperatives can serve as instruments of development and therefore need all the possible support . 
The dairy farmers can rest assured that they will continue to receive all support from the Government . 
Gandhiji , while envisaging the necessity of cooperative societies for his programme of ‘Gram Swaraj’ , had mentioned and I quote : " Cooperative societies are ideally suited organizations not only for developing village industries but also for promoting group effort by the villagers”
The spirit of cooperation espoused by the pioneering farmers of AMUL triggered a socio - economic revolution in rural India transforming an entire nation . 
The winning combination of the AMUL experiment has been the convergence of farmers’ wisdom , democratic set - up , professional management , and adoption of right technology . 
It is a model worth emulating , the followership of which could address problems in other areas faced by our farming community . 
AMUL is truly the pride of India . 
The onus is on the current generation of farmer - leaders , professionals and other stakeholders to expand the AMUL movement in a way that benefits farmers across the board . 
I urge you all to ensure that this world - class institution continues to progress with the same passion and commitment , and with the same values of integrity , efficiency and honesty which the founding fathers had instilled in AMUL . 
With the starting of this modern plant today , AMUL would revolutionize cattle feed manufacturing to address the nutritional requirements of the cattle population . 
I once again compliment you on this occasion and wish Godspeed for your endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT PRESIDENT’S STANDARD PRESENTATION PARADE
I am happy to be at Air Force Station Hasimara to award Standards to 18 Squadron and 22 Squadron . 
Both these Squadrons have distinguished themselves in the service of the Nation . 
They have a rich history of professional excellence and have served the Nation with honour and distinction in peace and during the two wars . 
The Nation honours them today with a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation for their selfless devotion , professionalism and courage in the face of adversity . 
I compliment the Air - Warriors on parade for their impeccable turnout and outstanding precision of movements . 
I am happy to see a well coordinated fly past and an immaculate aerobatic display . 
India’s increasing eminence in the comity of Nations draws its strength from the capabilities of our Armed Forces . 
Though we remain firmly committed to peace , we will use all our might to protect the sovereignty of our Nation , and I am confident that our valiant men and women in uniform will rise to the occasion . 
Our Armed Forces , exemplified by the Air - Warriors who stand before us , reflect our steely resolve to defend our interests . 
The Indian Air Force is the cutting edge of our Nation’s military might . 
Excellent performance of its personnel in international exercises , both at home and abroad , is indeed a glowing testimony to the level of training and preparedness of our Air Force . 
The Indian Air Force , besides safeguarding the sovereign skies of our Nation , has also been at the forefront of all humanitarian aid and disaster relief operations , most notably Op Rahat and the recent earthquake in Nepal . 
The resilience and tenacity displayed by our valiant Air - Warriors is a great source of pride for the Nation . 
Squadron or ‘Flying Bullets’ was formed on 15 April 1965 at Ambala . 
It was then equipped with world’s smallest fighter aircraft , the Gnats . 
Whether flying the Gnats or the lethal MiG - 27 ML aircraft , the Squadron has an enviable operational record . 
The Nation still remembers the sublime heroism and supreme sacrifice of Flying Officer Nirmal Jeet Singh Sekhon , Param Vir Chakra of this very Squadron that continues to inspire one and all . 
Flying Bullets continue to live up to the motto of ‘Teevra Aur Nirbhay’ . 
On their completion of 50 glorious years of gallant service to the Nation , I am very confident that ‘Flying Bullets’ will continue to operate as a formidable fighting force . 
Squadron , known as ‘Swifts’ was raised on 15 Oct 1966 inBareilly and equipped with Gnat Mk - I aircraft . On22 Nov 1971 , during the ‘Air Offensive for Liberation of Bangladesh’ , the Squadron drew first blood by shooting down three F - 86 Sabre jets over Jessorein a single sortie . 
For its daring and excellence , the Squadron was rechristened as ‘Sabre Slayers’and decorated with Battle Honour . 
Today , operating the MiG - 27 ML aircraft , they continue to take to the sky with the same fortitude and zeal in keeping with their motto of " Sahasam Vijayate” or " Courage Triumphs” . 
As 22 Squadron completes 50 glorious years in the service of the Nation , I am confident that the Swifts will continue to provide yeoman service to the nation and the Indian Air Force . 
As 22 Squadron completes 50 glorious years in the service of the Nation , I am confident that the Swifts will continue to provide yeoman service to the nation and the Indian Air Force . 
On this occasion I take the opportunity to compliment the personnel and families of 18 Squadron and 22 Squadron , past and present , for their selfless sacrifice and service to the Nation . 
The Nation is indeed proud of you . 
I wish you and your families the very best and a glorious future . 
INAUGURAL ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF INDOLOGISTS
It is , indeed , a great privilege for me to be present amidst you this morning . 
We welcome you all to the first ever International Conference of Indologists being hosted at the Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
It was hardly six months ago , in Moscow that I committed to host a working meeting of eminent experts on India’s unique heritage of art and culture , science and philosophy . 
As a student of history and Visitor of 114 institutions of higher learning in India , I had been keen to see such a gathering of scholarly Indologists at Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
I am happy that learned discussions will take place here over the next three days on the civilization that is India . 
I wanted the thoughts and perspectives that emerge from such informed exchanges to enlighten and inspire - for there cannot be a conversation about India that does not do so . 
The uniqueness of Indian religion , language and culture has , since ancient times , attracted travellers from faraway lands . 
Ancient India had world - renowned seats of higher learning . 
For about eighteen hundred years beginning 6thcentury BC , Indian universities like Takshashila , Nalanda , Vikramashila , Valabhi , Somapura and Odantapuri had dominated the world education system . 
They were a magnet for the finest minds and scholars in the world . 
Takshashila became the meeting point of four civilizations – Indian , Persian , Greek and Chinese – and was frequented by legendary personalities like Chandragupta Maurya , Chanakya , Panini , St . Thomas , Faxian , Charaka and Democritus . 
Indian scholarship , which had already achieved great heights , fascinated all who encountered it . 
From Megasthenes to Hiuen Tsang , Fa Hien , Hyecho and Al - Barauni , these scholars of Indian studies spread their understanding of India near and far . 
Indology , as we know it today , is a relatively new academic discipline . 
It took shape in the 19thCentury after this area of study developed on the foundation laid by 18thcentury pioneers including William Jones , Henry Thomas Colebrooke and August Wilhelm Schlegel . 
Max Muller , the German - born philologist of the 19thcentury , was one of the founders of the academic field of Indian studies . 
His works on Indology command great respect . 
Organizations like the Asiatic Society , the Royal Asiatic Society , the American Oriental Society and German Oriental Society as well as the Japanese Association of Indian and Buddhist Studies have also played a key role in the evolution of Indology . 
I would like to pay tribute to all Indologists and scholars of Indian history , art and culture , science and philosophy the world over . 
They have , over the centuries , contributed to the understanding , propagation and promotion of the Indian knowledge system in countries far and wide . 
I am delighted to confer today the first ‘Distinguished Indologist Award’ on the distinguished Prof . Emeritus Heinrich Freiherr Von Stietencron of the Federal Republic of Germany . 
He has been selected for his significant contribution to Indology . 
He has spent a lifetime as a researcher , teacher , academician and epigrapher on various aspects of the history of Indian religions and the study of regional traditions in Odisha . 
His research has resulted in as many as nineteen books and almost a hundred scientific research papers . 
His work has added quality and substance to indological studies and will go a long way in encouraging future efforts in this direction . 
I thank the eminent jury for their selection and I congratulate the learned Professor for this distinction conferred on him . 
I compliment the External Affairs Minister and Indian Council for Cultural Relations for instituting this Award and for bringing together under our roof this outstanding group of scholars . 
I take this opportunity to recognize , with appreciation , the invaluable contribution of all these eminent historians and academics in exploring and disseminating the Indian knowledge system . 
The themes selected for this Conference will , I am sure , stimulate interesting dialogue and propagation of knowledge . 
The outcome of these focused sessions will , no doubt , invigorate Indology in a very definitive manner . 
I thank Secretary to the President , Smt . Omita Paul for so effectively converting this idea into reality . 
As you will agree , Indology does not merely imply the study of India . 
Indology is , rather , the pursuit of a major component of human knowledge ; it is the understanding of the evolution of human civilization and is a science for the diagnosis and mitigation of the complexities of human life . 
Ancient Indians had left no stream of human consciousness unexplored - whether it was deeply delving into religion and philosophy or cracking the medicinal secrets of food . 
They studied , in fascinating detail , and wrote very succinctly , incredibly profound treatises on medical science , state craft , law , social science , metallurgy , language , grammar and aesthetics . Kautilya’sArthashastrais a comprehensive discourse on statecraft . 
Manusmritiis a legal text studied most widely . 
Nourishment of body through healthy food received equal attention andPakshastra ( cooking ) became a highly evolved subject . 
This year , the 21stof June was celebrated as the International Day of Yoga . 
With this , the ancient science of yoga has been demystified . 
It has been brought to the man on the street . 
He has learned how to make the practice of yoga a part of his daily routine . 
The global popularization of yoga will help to improve the lifestyle of those who adopt it and pro - actively safeguard their physical and mental well - being . 
I would like to encourage the younger generation of the world to study , practice and benefit from Ayurveda and other ancient Indian healing systems . 
I look forward to the increasing integration of this science into a holistic treatment of diseases . 
I would also like to see more Indology in the academic collaborations between India and her foreign partners . 
This will not only add new dimensions to the bilateral discourse of India with these friendly countries , but it will also create yet another layer of co - operation and mutual understanding . 
In ancient India , society accorded great value to novel thought . 
A scholar was expected to have independent views to be recognized as an erudite man or a ' hrishi ' . 
So rich was the intellectual discourse on all subjects concerning humanity that Tagore , in hisGeetanjali , likened India to a " divine ocean” and said which I now quote : " Nobody knows whose invitation has invoked so many souls who have gathered here like a turbulent current of a river that has come and dissolved itself in the Divine Ocean”
Early Indologists had relied on Sanskrit for their study of Indian culture . 
Sanskrit has long been the medium for studying at least two major religions of the world and eight philosophical schools . 
Similarly , Vedic mathematics is based in Sanskrit . 
As such , it is the key to a vast cache of literature , epics , aesthetics , dramaturgy , and the Indian civilization itself . 
It is the language of the greatest works on human development , world peace and global prosperity . 
The vedic texts were , perhaps , the first to pronounce the universal concept of " Vasudhaiva kutumvakam , which means " the world is one family” . 
In the words of Mark Twain , " India is the cradle of human race , the birthplace of human speech , the mother of history , the grandmother of legend and the great grandmother of tradition…
To my mind , the popularity of Indology lies in its wide scope and capacity to reveal solutions for all possible questions that the human mind may contemplate . 
It must be recognised that India’s ancient traditions , to survive and grow , did not hesitate to selectively embrace all that is good in modernism . 
Her history remains alive and vibrant in the thoughts , actions , customs and rituals of her people . 
Modernity , in all its manifestations is equally welcome here
We are , today , witnessing events without precedent : when the world is struggling to deal with the worst impulses of intolerance and hatred that mankind has ever witnessed . 
At such a time , there can be no better recourse than to remind ourselves of the high values , written and unwrittensamskaras , duties and the way of life that is the essence of India . 
This is the time to reinforce the civilizational values that bind together the complex diversity of modern - day India and promote them among our people and the world . 
As Swami Vivekananda had described so eloquently , If there is any land on this earth that can lay claim to be the blessed Punya Bhumi , to be the land to which all souls on this earth must come to account for Karma , the land to which every soul that is wending its way Godward must come to attain its last home , the land where humanity has attained its highest towards gentleness , towards generosity , towards purity , towards calmness , above all , the land of introspection and of spirituality - it is India… . . It is here that Indians build temples for Mohammedans and Christians ; nowhere else…
The one great lesson , therefore , that the world wants most , that the world has yet to learn from India , is the idea not only of toleration , but of sympathy . 
Let me hasten to clarify : I do not intend this assembly to excessively dwell on ancient times or merely fill us with nostalgia about India’s grand past . 
Instead , I anticipate that your scholastic interactions , while firmly anchoring today’s India in her glorious history – will illuminate the logical path to her destined greatness . 
I am confident that your deliberations over the next three days will highlight the manner in which pluralism and multi - culturalism are at the very core of the Indian psyche . 
They will surely make an important contribution to our existing body of knowledge in the area of Indology . 
I commend the Government of India under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister Smt . Sushma Swaraj for the encouragement and promotion of Indological studies both in India and abroad . 
I am confident that the focus of such initiatives will be constructive and will continue on a sustained basis . 
With these words , I wish the Conference great success . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF MEETING WITH TOP 10 WINNING TEAMS OF ‘INNOVATE FOR DIGITAL INDIA CHALLENGE’
I congratulate the winning teams of the Innovate for Digital India challenge on their success and for the precise presentation they have made before me today . 
I am happy to learn that Department of Electronics and Information Technology has collaborated with Intel India to run this competition that aims to identify , support and mentor companies with workable IT solutions to problems in various sectors like health care , education and e - governance . 
I am sure that the Innovative Solutions presented today would be developed to benefit the citizens of the country . 
Today , India needs innovation to tackle various challenges in the fields of Education , Health care , Financial Inclusion and Service delivery . 
We face the challenge of scalability and mass applicability of solutions to the problems of public concern . 
How do we make more than one million people joining us every month not only educated but also digitally educated ? 
How do we make them skilled for the requirement of the Industry to make them gainfully employed ? 
How do we reach every household in rural areas to provide them affordable preventive as well as curative health care services ? 
How do we connect small farmers , entrepreneurs in our small towns and villages with banks to enable them to participate in the economic development of the country more vigorously ? 
And most important of all , how do we make the services that government provides to the citizen more accessible , inclusive and transparent ? 
The solution lies in harnessing the digital revolution backed by innovations . 
The digital revolution has in a way decentralized the governance . 
One does not necessarily need a very big company or even the government to think and bring solutions to all the problems . 
Today , any innovation happening anywhere in the country or world can be replicated and adopted suitably on large scale . 
Indian civilization has been known for innovations . 
I am glad to see that our government has joined hand with IT giants like Intel and Academic Institutions like IIM Ahmedabad to crowd source Ideas , incubate , fund and mentor them to make them workable and replicable . 
Bright Idea may come from a single source , but to see it fructify into action is our collective responsibility . 
The Digital India campaign of our government aims to work on providing digital infrastructure as a service to the citizens , providing governance and services on demand and digitally empowering the citizens . 
These are very ambitious but desirable goals . 
The National Optical Fiber Network started in 2011 aims to bring broad band services to all the Gram Panchayats of the country by next year end . 
This connectivity will enable the hinterland of our country to become part of the digital revolution and benefit from it . 
Another important goal of spreading digital literacy and education to all will have to be pursued vigorously because we cannot afford digital divide in our society if we aspire to become economically stronger and inclusive . 
The third and most important goal of providing services on demand , will require innovation to build solutions , test them and make them popular . 
This certainly requires , coming together of the government , individuals , Academic and Research institutions and Entrepreneurs . 
I am sure that the " Innovate for Digital India Challenge” will provide a platform for innovators and other stakeholders to collaborate . 
It will continue to bring forth affordable , workable and innovative solutions to the problems of the common man . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE CAVALRY MEMORIAL LECTURE ORGANIZED BY THE CAVALRY OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION
I am pleased to be here this evening to deliver the Cavalry Memorial Lecture organized by the Cavalry Officers’ Association . 
This organization of serving and retired officers of the Indian Armoured Corps conducts this Lecture annually to pay tribute to a decorated soldier of the Corps . 
It is my privilege to deliver the Lecture this year in honour of Major D . S . Narag , the first recipient of the Maha Vir Chakra in the 1971 War for Bangladesh liberation . 
I take this opportunity to pay my homage to Major Narag and other Indian soldiers who laid down their lives in the War . 
Major Narag made the supreme sacrifice for the nation in the battle of Garibpur . In this Memorial Lecture , I have been asked to share my perceptions about the formation of Bangladesh . 
Let me begin with an explanation . 
As you would appreciate , perceptions always tend to be subjective , more so in history . 
What happened in 1971 is recorded in contemporary history . 
In the long history of world diplomacy , relations between countries have seen many ups and downs . 
Europe was the arena for two World Wars and the major European powers fought battles with each other for centuries . 
However , in the second half of the previous century , they imbibed lessons from history and decided to work together . 
They created a common market and a common currency . 
They created a European Union and a European Parliament . 
One of the most important inventions which have changed the world is the Internet , which is a product of the peace dividend in Europe . 
Similarly , seven nations of South Asia came together at the initiative of Bangladesh on December 8 , 1985 to establish the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) in order to deepen regional cooperation and integration for peace and prosperity . 
In the last thirty years , we have created many mechanisms and institutions on the model of the European Union . 
It is however widely accepted that the full potential of SAARC is yet to be realized . 
As I have often said , we can change our friends but not our neighbours . 
It is for us to decide if we want to live in a state of perpetual tension or develop together in an atmosphere of peace and harmony . 
We must look at a shared future leaving behind the divisions of the past . 
India - Bangladesh relations is a good example of progress in looking at a shared future . Our relations today are the best ever since 1974 . 
They are based on mutual benefit , equality and respect for sovereignty . 
India attaches the highest importance to bilateral relations with Bangladesh . 
We have always believed that strong , stable and prosperous neighbours are in our interest . 
India and Bangladesh are not just neighbours . 
We are two nations bound by the threads of history , religion , culture , language and kinship . 
Our growing cooperation is a picture of shared prosperity amongst neighbours . 
With Bangladesh , we now need to recapture the spirit of the Liberation War of 1971 to build a new future . 
Bangladesh has in recent times achieved tremendous success in every walk of life . 
Bangladesh is today a thriving democracy . 
From being ' basket case ' in 1971 , it is now self - sufficient in food grains . 
Its food grains output is around 34 million tonnes . 
Its growth rate has been over 6 percent in last 15 years . 
Bangladesh’s foreign exchange reserves are around USD 24 billion , which is the second largest in South Asia . 
Bangladesh has pioneered a social revolution with significant achievements in women ' s empowerment , child health care , women ' s health care and immunization . 
Like India , it is a young country with more than 50 percent of population below 24 years . 
Once again like us , Bangladesh is focused on developing the ICT and Services Sector . 
Issues of concern between the two countries have been mutually resolved . 
For instance , a bilateral treaty signed on 12 December 1996 established an arrangement for sharing of the Ganges’ water . 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a very successful visit to Bangladesh on June 6 - 7 , 2015 . 
A large number of agreements were signed on the occasion including the Land Boundary Agreement . 
This agreement on exchange of enclaves this year has finally put to rest the long - pending land boundary issue with Bangladesh . 
We also settled the maritime boundary last year . 
India has granted duty free and quota free access to Bangladesh on all but 25 items . 
Indo - Bangladesh trade at over 7 billion US Dollars makes Bangladesh our second largest trading partner in South Asia . 
Power supply from India to Bangladesh , which commenced in October 2013 , is expected to grow from 500 MW to 1100 MW within two years . 
Connectivity is the catalyst for deeper engagement . 
We have launched three bus services that will connect our citizens more easily . 
I firmly believe that connectivity by road , rail , rivers , sea , transmission lines , petroleum pipelines and digital links must increase . 
Regional connectivity and cooperation between Bangladesh , Bhutan , India and Nepal must also be deepened . 
We have worked out mutually beneficial arrangements allowing movement of goods from Bangladesh through India to Nepal and Bhutan and from mainland India through Bangladesh to India’s North - east . 
These are significant steps forward which have been enabled by the close cooperation and frequent interaction of senior leaders of the two countries . 
India - Bangladesh security cooperation is growing with three agreements having been concluded recently on human trafficking , fake currency , maritime co - operation and co - operation between our Coast Guards . 
We are focusing on improving border management and coordination to prevent illegal activities , trafficking and movements . 
India remains fully committed to partner Bangladesh in its economic development . 
Regular exchanges and wide dialogue between our two peoples are important to enhance our mutual understanding and goodwill . 
We must move towards greater economic integration . 
South Asia should become an integrated market . 
A seamless assembly line as well as regional value chains for global markets should be created . 
Indian and Bangladesh businessmen are already collaborating in fields such as readymade garments , textiles , leather and pharmaceuticals . 
There exists huge potential for doing same in food processing , light engineering goods , ship building and auto components . 
Indian investments in Bangladesh will help to create jobs and upgrade technology . 
These will make Bangladesh economy more competitive and increase exports . 
It is for this reason that the two Governments have agreed to cooperate to set up an Indian Special Economic Zone in Bangladesh . 
This is another big step forward towards restoring historic connections between our business communities , which will serve both well . 
Bangladesh and India must come together as large consumers to develop and purchase cheap and clean energy . 
There is huge untapped potential to develop renewable energy like solar and wind . 
As our economies get more integrated and our people better connected , our nations will become more prosperous . 
It will also open new economic doors for India ' s Northeast . 
It will enable our two countries to integrate South Asia and connect it with the dynamic East . 
I am confident India - Bangladesh relations will always remain special and unique in the annals of South Asian history . 
I pay tribute once again to Major D . S . Narag and all other Indian soldiers who distinguished themselves through bravery and sacrifices in the 1971 War of Bangladesh Liberation . 
I pay tribute to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , one of the most outstanding leaders that this world has seen . 
His leadership and sacrifices gave birth to Bangladesh . 
Today , his daughter Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is leading Bangladesh to greater and greater heights of glory . 
The stage is now set for a quantum jump in our relations . 
I am confident the coming days will see a significant intensification of co - operation to eradicate poverty , enhance growth , promote trade and investment as well as fight the forces of terrorism , extremism and fundamentalism . 
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to deliver this Memorial Lecture and reflect on a topic close to my heart . 
I wish you Godspeed in your endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF THE NATIONAL PRESS DAY
I am happy to participate in the National Press Day commemoration being organised by the Press Council of India . 
I convey my greetings to all members of the Press Council as well as the entire media fraternity on this special occasion . 
The subject for this year’s discussion is " The impact and import of cartooning and caricatures as a medium of expression of opinion” . 
I understand that the discussions are dedicated to two legendary cartoonists , R . K . Laxman and Rajinder Puri , who are no longer with us . 
I pay tribute to these two individuals who made immense contribution to the art of cartooning as well as public accountability and social criticism in our country . 
The Press Council and the Kerala Cartoon Academy have organized an exhibition of caricatures featuring me for this occasion . 
That they have chosen this as a practical demonstration of the theme of this year’s discussion , is both welcome and flattering . Cartoons and caricatures are good stress busters , for the viewing public as well as those featured in them . 
The cartoonist captures the mood of the time and his art lies in being able to lampoon without hurting , caricature without distorting and to say with a few strokes of the brush what lengthy articles fail to express . 
I have been the subject of cartoons and caricatures for many decades now . 
Until I stopped smoking , I was always identified in caricatures with a trademark pipe . 
It feels good to be able to enjoy and laugh at cartoons of oneself . 
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , our first Prime Minister used to repeatedly tell V . Shankar , the doyen of Indian Cartoonists , " Don’t spare me , Shankar” . 
He would often drive down to Shankar’s house for a cup of coffee and a chat about the subject of the cartoon . 
This open mindedness and appreciation of genuine criticism is one of the lovable traditions of our great nation , which we must preserve and strengthen . 
I congratulate this year’s recipients of the National Awards instituted by the Press Council for eminent journalists , news photographers and illustrators . 
Prestigious awards such as these are a public recognition , of talent , merit and hard work , by peers and leaders in the profession . 
Such awards should be cherished and valued by those who receive them . 
Sensitive minds sometimes get disturbed by some incidents in society . 
Emotions should not overrun reason , and disagreement should be expressed through debate and discussion . 
We must , as proud Indians , have confidence in the idea of India and the values and principles enshrined in our Constitution . 
India has always been able to self - correct whenever such a need has arisen . 
Freedom of the press in India forms part of the freedom of expression which is guaranteed by the Constitution as a fundamental right . 
Protection of this right is our bounden duty . 
In a democracy , various challenges will emerge from time to time . 
These should be addressed collectively . 
We must ensure that the letter and spirit of the law always remains a living reality . 
The National Press Day is marked every yearonNovember 16 , the day when in 1966the Press Council of India started functioning as an autonomous , statutory and quasi - judicial body . 
The Press Council has the dual mandate of protecting the freedom of the press and ensuring that the Press exercises its freedom within the ambit of the ethics of journalism and the legal framework of our country
Over the years , the Press Council of India has played an important role in promoting press freedom and instilling public trust and confidence in the news media . 
The growth of newspapers and agencies in our country has its roots in our freedom struggle . 
The press in India has evolved , not through the aegis of the Government but due to the commitment of individuals who used it as a tool to fight the exploitative and oppressive policies of the colonial Government . 
Newspapers became the platforms for social reform movements across the country . 
It is a matter of pride that between 1780 until India’s Independence in 1947 , more than 120 newspapers and periodicals were launched in almost every Indian language . 
Each of these publications carried the ideals of freedom to the doorsteps of our people and spread the message of an independent India . 
The first newspaper in India was the ‘Hickey’s Gazette’ or ‘Bengal Gazette’ started on January 29 , 1780 by an Irishman , James Augustus Hickey . 
This weekly political and commercial paper declared itself as ‘‘open to all parties but influenced by none’’ and its content included criticism of the British East India Company . 
James Silk Buckingham , the Editor of the ‘Calcutta Journal’’ established in 1818 , was a social reformer and close associate of Raja Ram Mohan Roy . 
Samachar Darpanin Bengali founded in 1818 was the first regional language newspaper . 
The Times of India was born on November 3 , 1838 as ‘‘The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce” . 
It’s Editor , Robert Knight used to upbraid British officials for their nastiness towards Indians and for doing precious little to eradicate India’s poverty . 
The Amrita Bazar Patrika was founded on February 20 , 1868 as a Bengali weekly by Sisir Ghosh and Moti Lal Ghosh . 
It became instantly popular because of its campaign against injustice and inequality . 
It overnight turned into an English weekly from March 21 , 1878 in order to escape the provisions of the oppressive Vernacular Press Act . 
The Hindu was founded in Madras in 1878 by the Triplicane Six - a group of law students and teachers ; Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak founded theKesari in 1881 ; Dadabhai Naoroji established the Voice of India in 1883 ; Bande Mataram was published in 1906 by Bipan Chandra Pal and edited by Aurobindo Ghose ; Gopal Krishna Gokhale founded the Hitavada in1911 ; Tribune was started by Dayal Singh Majithia in 1881 . 
Motilal Nehru started the Independent in 1919 and Mahatma Gandhi , the Indian Opinion in 1904 in South Africa and Navjeevan and Young India in 1919 in India as well as the Harijan in 1932 . 
These trailblazers became the conscience keepers of the country and through their relentless campaigns gave voice to the struggle for independence . 
Today , the influence , credibility and quality of our media is well recognized all over the world . 
The Indian media has grown in scale , reach and revenues over the years . 
Its significance has further increased with higher literacy levels and the revolution in communication technologies . 
New media has brought about a convergence between traditional , audio - visual , digital and social media . 
It has become a powerful means for shaping the ideas , aspirations and behaviour of our people , even in the remotest corners of our country . 
This entrusts media with an additional responsibility . 
They must act as a watchdog of public interest and give voice to the marginalized . 
Journalists must bring to public notice the array of ills and deprivations that continue to beset large number of our people . 
They must shape and influence public opinion even as they provide objective and balanced coverage of news . 
Gloom and dark alone should not dominate news coverage . 
A conscious effort should be made to show what is noble and good in the society . 
It must highlight the positive and inspire change for the better . 
The power of the media should be used to reset our moral compass and promote liberalism , humanism and decency in public life . 
The media has an important role to play in cleansing public life . 
For that , the conduct of the media itself should be above board . 
Independence and integrity are two sides of the same coin and it goes for every one of us including the media . 
Sensationalism should not substitute for objective , accurate and dispassionate reporting . 
While opinion is free , facts should be sacred . 
Caution should be exercised in passing judgements , especially on matters where the due process of law is yet to be completed . 
We must never forget that careers and reputations take years to build but only minutes to demolish . 
It is said accusations appear in headlines , denial in small print and contradictions are hidden away amidst cheap advertisements . 
The media must realise that it remains always accountable to its readers and viewers and through them , to the entire nation . 
. The media recognized as the fourth estate serves as a facilitator , protector and enabler of democratic institutions and processes . 
It is an important component in the fabric of a functional democracy . As India marches forward into the 21st century , it is extremely important that the free press of India remains strong and vibrant . 
On this day , I recall the thousands of journalists who toil day and night across the country to provide access to latest and accurate information to the people of our country . 
The media fraternity of India are not only providers of news , but also educators who empower our citizens and strengthen the democratic framework of our country . 
I thank you for your service to the country and wish you the very best in all your future endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY OF THE 35TH INDIA INTERNATIONAL TRADE FAIR 2015
It is indeed a pleasure for me to be here today for the inauguration ceremony of the 35th India International Trade Fair ( IITF ) , which is the flagship event of India Trade Promotio
I am particularly glad to find considerable participation of companies from the SAARC region . 
Our South Asian neighbours are our highest priority in keeping with our ‘neighbourhood first’ policy . 
Our approach to South Asia has always been one of seeking shared prosperity and security . 
The fact , however , is that our region remains amongst the least integrated and developed , underlining the need for greater co - operation and intensification of our trade effort . 
In this context , it is good to see Afghanistan as the ‘Partner Country’ and Bangladesh as the ‘Focus Country’ in IITF 2015 . 
Through closer economic co - operation with Afghanistan , India can provide not only a vast and growing market for its goods and services , but can also be a source of capital , technology , best - practices and institutions appropriate for Afghanistan’s needs . 
Bangladesh is one of the faster growing economies in the region . It is emerging as a sound manufacturing base for multinational companies in sectors like textiles . 
The potential for both our economies to grow together is high , given our resources . 
Like India , Bangladesh is a nation with a significant population in the productive age group , with 65 percent of her 159 million people falling in the 15 to 64 years age category . 
Our countries already cooperate in a wide spectrum of economic activities like trade and commerce , and power sector . 
Our respective economic progress must provide greater opportunities to both our peoples . 
I take a moment here to mention about Madhya Pradesh , which is the Focus State for IITF 2015 . 
Innovative measures have seen this State making progress on all fronts , particularly agriculture , where the growth rate has been close to 20 percent during the last two years . 
I also compliment Goa and Jharkhand , the Partner States , for their participation in this prestigious event . 
Goa is one of the fastest growing states in the country and amongst the leading states in per capita income . 
Goa’s well - developed social , physical and industrial infrastructure and IT connectivity has led to a strong economic performance , particularly in industrial sectors like mining , tourism and pharmaceuticals . 
Jharkhand is located in one of the richest mineral zones in the world . 
It accounts for 40 percent of India’s total mineral reserves . 
Jharkhand ranks first in coal reserves and second in iron ore reserves . 
Given its distinct location advantage , the potential for industrial development is high . 
This State produces 17 percent of the total iron ore produced in the country . 
The IITF is a brand name in itself and enjoys recognition worldwide . 
This annual celebration of trade and industry aims to deepen our bilateral relations with the rest of the world . 
In the realm of external relations , the Government of India has intensified our engagement with neighbours and friendly countries across the globe . 
Recently in the last week of October , we successfully conducted the 3rd India - Africa Forum Summit . 
The participation of all 54 African nations in the Summit has , in foreign policy terms , moved us into a select group of nations having the capacity and ability to engage all of Africa simultaneously . 
India is also working with like - minded countries in multilateral organisations , including the United Nations , to play an enhanced role in diverse fora , from the Arctic Council and the Pacific Alliance to the UN Security Council , where India has made a legitimate claim for permanent membership . 
The potential of India now has a stronger resonance . 
IITF 2015 presents an ideal platform for the global fraternity which has a shared interest in trade relations to enhance peace and prosperity . 
India’s efforts for inclusive economic growth and social advancement have shown the way forward to many developing countries . 
This is a time of great opportunities in India . 
Several recent initiatives of the Government of India have already started showing results and have created a positive impact in key sectors . 
The ‘Make - in - India ' initiative to make India an investment and manufacturing destination ; the ‘Digital India’ programme to transform India into a digitally - empowered society ; ‘Start - up India , Stand - up India’ to promote entrepreneurship and job creation ; ‘Smart Cities’ ; ‘Model Villages’ ; ‘Swachh Bharat’ , and the ‘Clean Ganga Mission’ are some of the flagship schemes of the Government . 
In the last year alone , almost 140 million bank accounts have been opened under ‘Jan Dhan Yojna’ in a massive effort at financial inclusion . 
Our economy has admirably withstood the challenging global economic scenario of the past few years . 
Despite the economic slowdown afflicting major economies of the world , India has remained largely insulated . 
Barring a below - five percent growth in one year – that is in 2012 - 13 – our economy has shown resilience . 
The economic scenario is again looking up with 7 . 2 percent economic growth in 2014 - 15 . 
It is expected to improve further as other macro - economic indicators show substantial improvement . 
Inflation is within control and industrial performance is also showing signs of revival . 
Fiscal consolidation measures are in place and we should be able to meet the target of 3 . 0 percent fiscal deficit by 2017 - 18 . 
The external sector should not be a cause of concern despite a not - so - encouraging export performance last year . 
Slowdown in global economic activity also finds reflection in decreasing imports , with a substantial reduction in our import dependence on oil , from US Dollar 165 billion in 2013 - 14 to US Dollar 138 billion . 
As such , our current account balance has improved with the deficit on this account having reduced from 1 . 7 percent of GDP in 2013 - 14 to 1 . 4 percent in 2014 - 15 . 
Foreign exchange reserve at 350 billion US Dollars as of end September is at a comfortable level . 
With a favourable global economic outlook , our diversification strategy focusing on export markets in Asia , Africa and Latin America , and our push for theMake - in - India campaign , I expect to see a turnaround in our export performance soon . 
The opportunities that are emerging in our economy are there for the taking . 
Investors , both domestic and foreign , should have the confidence to gain handsome returns from their investments in India . 
IITF is closely linked to sustained economic growth and trade . 
We are a 2 . 1 trillion dollar economy and have the potential to be a 10 trillion dollar economy over the next two decades , provided we are able to provide a fillip to manufacturing and innovation . 
The centrality of the ‘Make - in - India’ campaign towards the achievement of this goal cannot be over emphasized . 
I am therefore pleased to note that the theme for this edition of IITF is ‘Make - in - India’ . 
Both ITPO and the Ministry of Commerce have a vital role in making the ‘Make - in - India’ programme a success . 
It is a matter of satisfaction that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has taken major reform initiatives on improving the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in India with added emphasis on simplification and rationalization of the existing rules and enhanced use of IT to make governance more efficient and effective . 
The IITF endeavours to preserve , protect and promote India’s cultural heritage through collaboration amongst Government , industry , and artisans , craft persons and weavers . 
This is with a view to establish marketing linkages and promote their products in the business world . 
I am sure that IITF will take the lead in reinforcing Indian brands . 
Promising Indian brands can compete and win against dominant international brands in the Indian market before successfully venturing overseas . 
Successive editions of the trade fair have also proved to be an excellent platform for small and micro enterprises which display their products at different pavilions . 
The ITPO has taken several initiatives this year to improve facilities offered to visitors . . 
Some of them , including the facility for online registration for business days ; introducing a separate award category for the best State pavilion dedicated to ‘Swachh Bharat’ initiatives ; and providing details of the fair through mobile applications , are praiseworthy . 
I compliment ITPO and its supporting agencies for organizing the Fair with improved logistics and facilities . 
I am confident that this Fair will provide a renewed impetus to trade and commerce and deepen our economic relationship with our trading partners across the globe . 
I extend my good wishes to all the participants from India and abroad . 
Best of luck for a successful conduct of the Fair . 
With these words , I declare the 35thedition of the India International Trade Fair open . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF LAUNCH OF IMPRINT INDIA ON THE SECOND DAY OF VISITOR’S CONFERENCE
I extend a warm welcome to you all who are here to attend the first - ever Visitor’s Conference . 
In the past , I have had the occasion to meet many of you during the different conferences organized at the Rashtrapati Bhavan and convocations at your institutes . 
This is , however , the first time that as Visitor , I am meeting you all together . 
As mentioned by my Secretary , the outcomes of the previous conferences have given us the confidence that the institutes of higher learning , if they come together , can make a difference in a short span of time to higher education sector in our country . 
With this shared belief , we are here today . 
I thank Hon’ble Prime Minister , Shri Narendra Modi , for his gracious presence . 
His enchanting speech and inspiring words , I have no doubt , will set the tone for the deliberations during the Conference . 
I take this opportunity to also place on record my appreciation for Shrimati Smriti Zubin Irani , Minister for Human Resource Development . 
By steering various initiatives with purpose and energy , she has taken forward the education sector . 
I compliment the Prime Minister and the HRD Minister for the just - launched programme of IMPRINT , a Pan IIT and IISc initiative
The ten themes of this programme identifying the immediate requirements of the society will lay down the research roadmap for institutes of national importance . 
I call upon the academic leaders of institutes in social sector and humanities’ domain to formulate a similar joint initiative for conducting research on themes of relevance to public policy - making . 
Distinguished Guests , Ladies and Gentlemen : 
It is true that the past ten years have seen a vast expansion of the higher education infrastructure . 
However , low Gross Enrolment Ratio ( GER ) at 21 percent in India as against the world average of 27 percent remains a cause for concern . 
A New Education Policy is being formulated . 
I am told that a process of consultation has commenced on 13 themes for school education and 20 themes for higher education . 
The new policy must alter the dynamics of the education sector and help us achieve the GER target of 30 percent by 2020 , a goal we cannot afford to miss . 
At the altar of expansion , quality should not be sacrificed . 
Greater number of institutions translates into greater number of seats , enhancing access and equity in higher education . 
However , it has generated a lively debate on reach versus excellence , quality versus affordability , and accountability versus autonomy . 
A calm assessment will make it clear to all stakeholders that we need both reach and excellence , quality and affordability , and autonomy with accountability . 
Increasing access in higher education throughdigital inclusion is a way forward . 
We should , without delay , think of taking modified MOOCs to the secondary education level . 
To skill India , we must design MOOCs that is interactive and offer vocational aspirants an opportunity to learn . 
This could revolutionize delivery of skills knowledge . 
Distinguished participants : An institute of higher learning finds its real value by excelling in education , research and innovation . 
This calls for faculty development and augmentation of teaching resources across the board . 
This calls for inspired teachers , keen - to - learn students , and good physical and research infrastructure . 
This also calls for a reliable and extensive ICT network . 
Some encouraging developments in the recent past , that I can recall are : 
Intensification of exchange of faculty through formal arrangements with foreign institutions : 
In addition to the MOUs that must have been signed by various institutions of higher learning , over 80 MOUs with 50 overseas institutions have been signed during my visits abroad in the last two years . 
This demonstrates the interest and potential for collaboration with international institutions . 
Removal of bottlenecks and simplification of procedures for filling up faculty positions ; 
Engagement of adjunct faculty and hiring of foreign experts - the Global Initiative for Academic Networks ( GIAN ) is a welcome step aimed at tapping the global pool of talented scientists and entrepreneurs . 
By encouraging their engagement with Indian institutes , we can augment our country’s academic resources . 
Distinguished participants : It is good to see research moving centre - stage in our institutes of higher learning . 
This will in near future help us meet the need for good faculty . 
A recent example is IIT Delhi , which has awarded 221 PhDs this year , the highest in a year so far . 
It has resolved to increase this number to 400 in the next few years . 
Such initiatives will not only lead to higher research quotient for the nation but also improve rankings of the institutions . 
Earlier not a single Indian institution came within the top 200 institutions in international rankings . 
It seems that my persistent exhortation has paid off . 
Many of you have responded to my call . I am grateful for that . 
Our institutions are now taking the ranking process more seriously , in a proactive and systematic manner . 
In the QS World University Rankings 2015 - 16 , Indian institutions have broken into the top 200 for the first time . 
I compliment Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore , which is ranked 147th and Indian Institute of Technology , Delhi , ranked 179th , for this achievement . 
If we provide enough funds to top 10 - 20 institutions for next 4 - 5 years , we will soon see them storm into the top 100 . 
The National Institutional Ranking Framework launched by the Ministry of HRD with an India - centric approach is a step in the right direction . 
This initiative should enable Indian institutes of higher learning to realize their potential and emerge as world - class institutions . 
Ladies and Gentlemen : Knowledge is indivisible . 
We must follow a multi - disciplinary approach that allows students to learn and seek knowledge holistically . 
Our institutions must impart education to the students that help expand their intellect , form their character , instill in them a spirit of service and love for the motherland . 
It must equip them to face the struggle of real life . 
It must deepen the students’ linkage with society . 
It is also necessary to develop in our students a scientific temper , which allows the flight of imagination beyond the realm of grades and classrooms . 
Promotion of research at the under - graduate level would assist such an objective . 
Distinguished participants : The link between progress and innovation is direct . 
History is witness to many nations low on natural resources emerging as advanced economies only on the strength of rapid technological development . 
India today stands within a striking distance of realizing the dreams of the founding fathers of our nation . 
Indian youth are second to none in entrepreneurship . 
India serves as the fastest growing start - up base worldwide and stands third with 4 , 200 start - ups , next only to US and UK . 
The government has initiated the ‘Start - up India , Stand - up India’ campaign to incentivize entrepreneurial ventures . 
Heads of institutes of higher learning must work towards creating an innovation and research network that will produce entrepreneurs and nurture innovations . 
The setting up of Innovation Clubs in over 60 Central institutions in the last two years is a good beginning for a platform where novel ideas can be nurtured and innovators mentored to develop new products . 
In response to the decision taken in the conference of vice chancellors of central universities in 2014 , industry interface cells have been set up in many institutions . 
These cells are now lending vigour toactivities like joint research , faculty exchange , and setting up of chairs and endowments . 
These cells can also interact closely with innovation incubators for monetizing ideas and research . 
The 45 MOUs signed with the industry yesterday takes to next level the partnership between industry and academia . 
Ladies and Gentlemen : Academic institutions are an important stakeholder for the socio - economic development of the nation . 
I had earlier asked central universities and NITs to adopt at least five villages and transform them into model villages . 
I now extend my call to all the 114 central institutions . 
After identifying problems in the adopted villages , they must pool all academic and technical resources at their disposal to provide solutions that will enhance the quality of life of our countrymen . 
As we start the deliberations in this Conference , I assure you of an exciting journey ahead in the world of education . 
Be ready for roadblocks , criticisms , failures and successes . 
But continue to work with a fresh and positive mind . 
Do take heart from what Mahatma Gandhi had said , and I quote : " First they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , then you win” . 
And win you shall . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AFTER WITNESSING THE EXCHANGE OF MOUS BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ON THE FIRST DAY OF VISITOR’S CONFERENCE
To begin with , let me extend a warm welcome to you all . Today is an important day for higher education in our country . 
For the first time in Rashtrapati Bhavan , brilliant minds , captains of industry and academic leaders of 114 central institutions have come together on a common platform to deliberate on issues concerning the higher education sector . 
Let me confess , at the beginning of my Presidential term I was a stranger to the role of Visitor of central institutions of higher learning . 
Visits to various universities - so far , I have visited over 100 institutions - and discussions with eminent educationists led to the convening of a series of conferences of these institutions at Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
Starting from February 2013 , seven conferences have been held so far . 
I have had the opportunity to interact with the heads of central institutions in groups - thrice with central universities , twice with NITs and once each with IISERs and IITs . 
Recommendations emanating from these discussions have greatly benefitted all stakeholders . 
The discussion during these conferences focused on : 
Improvement in the quality of education , research and innovation , and faculty development . 
Creating international linkages for joint research , and faculty and student exchanges . 
Improving the rankings of the institutions . 
Greater use of ICT networks and development of modified MOOCs to deliver quality education at affordable prices . 
Greater involvement of alumni in the management structure of the institutions . 
Deeper engagement of industry with the academic institutions . 
The results we have achieved in these few years are remarkable . 
The credit goes to the dedicated teamwork of all the stakeholders . 
My constant refrain that we cannot aspire to be a world power without having a single world - class university , has found resonance amongst the institutions , who have now started looking at the international ranking processes in a more proactive and systematic manner . 
For the first time , two Indian institutions have found place in the top 200 positions in QS rankings . 
IISc Bangalore at 147th and IIT Delhi at 179thplace deserve full praise and compliments . 
If we provide enough funds to top 10 to 15 institutions for the next 4 - 5 years , I am confident that these institutions will storm into the top 100 of global academic rankings within next few years . 
The National Institutional Rankings Framework put in place by the Ministry of HRD with an India - centric approach will further help our institutions to compete nationally and globally . 
Apart from giving the nation , the institutions , its students and its alumni a sense of pride , a high rank can help attract quality faculty and meritorious students , open fresh avenues of growth and placement for students , and provide a benchmark for continuous improvement in standards . 
Innovation is the currency of the future . Innovation converts research into wealth . 
Unless we recognize this reality and start working in a focused manner on creating a strong innovation culture in our country now , we will be left behind in the march to modernity . 
Way back in February 2013 , I had called upon the universities to establish links with grassroots innovators . 
The response has been very encouraging . 
Over 60 central institutions have started innovation clubs to provide a platform for interaction between the academic community and grassroots innovators . 
In April 2014 , when I met the heads of IISc and IISERs , I stressed upon the need to create synergy between the activities of these clubs with innovation incubators located in the technical institutes like IITs and NITs to create an innovation network . 
This effort needs a further push . 
I understand the National Innovation Foundation has compiled a catalogue of grassroots innovations after segregating them into three sectors . 
I am sure central institutions as well as participating industries will find it a useful document . 
I am confident that this linkage of grassroots innovators with entrepreneurs and financiers will yield a rich crop of " start ups” . 
A strong inter - linkage between industry and academia is a critical component for developing the educational and industrial eco - systems . 
In all the conferences conducted so far , the participants were unanimous that this eco - system needs further strengthening . 
It is therefore a momentous day , today , as industry captains and leaders of academic institutions have joined hands to sign 44 Memoranda of Understanding . 
It shows on the one hand the increasing commitment of the industry towards institutes of higher learning , and on the other , exhibits a strong desire of academic institutions to constructively engage with industrial partners . 
I applaud all industry leaders , particularly CII as the focal point , for collaborating with the President’s Secretariat in this initiative . 
I will like to place on record my appreciation for the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers and the Ministry of HRD for their efforts in finalizing these MOUs aimed at deepening the eco - system for industry - academia dialogue . 
Today , the participants of the Conference have had the benefit of listening to the inspiring words of Prof . C . N . R . Rao , Prof . M . S . Swaminathan and Shri Kailash Satyarthi . 
These mighty minds have travelled unchartered territories and excelled in trying circumstances . 
I thank them for sparing their time to come here and share their transformative ideas with the participants . 
Before I conclude , I want to share with you this thought of Mahatma Gandhi . I quote : " A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history” . 
The gathering here today represents that small body of determined men and women . 
The mission is clear . 
We have to move forward now . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE BANQUET HOSTED FOR THE HEADS OF STATE / GOVERNMENT / DELEGATION ATTENDING THE THIRD INDIA AFRICA FORUM SUMMIT
It is a singular honour for me to welcome all of you , Heads of State and Government of Africa , here today , at the heart of the Indian Republic . 
I welcome you not only as leaders of proud nations but as friends and brothers . 
India welcomes you not only with open arms but with an open heart . 
This is a historic evening ; it is a memorable moment . 
A century ago when the construction of this building you see before you began , it would have been difficult to imagine such a moment . 
It would have been difficult to imagine that India as well as so many African nations would discard their colonial chains , throw away the imperial yoke and one day stand together here to celebrate freedom , democracy and human dignity . 
India is honoured to host the third India - Africa Forum Summit in Delhi and I would like to thank each and every one of you for being part of this Summit . 
It is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s drive which has brought us together for this event . 
I am supremely confident that the work done during the Summit , the fashioning of a collective vision for the future of our people will be critical in defining the direction and contours of our political and economic engagement . 
Given that India and Africa are home to a third of the world ' s population , this engagement is certain to have an impact on the future of sustainable development of the world . 
Excellencies , the Third India - Africa Forum Summit has been a great success due to your participation and deliberations . 
Your shared vision and guidance reflected in the two documents that have been adopted by you at the Summit encapsulate the India - Africa strategic partnership as a unique example of South –South Co - operation . 
Ours is a qualitatively different , infinitely richer relationship . 
We feel the depth of this relationship in our hearts . 
The bonds between Africa and India are not those which are fashioned by words and statements ; these bonds have been forged in the furnace of struggle - the struggle for freedom and independence , the struggle for equality and dignity . 
We are close because we know what it is to suffer , we know what it means not to be master of one ' s own destiny . 
We know what it means to see the flower of our youth languish in colonial prisons . 
We know what it is to live in poverty , disease and darkness even while our own rich resources are plundered by others . 
India and Africa have special bonds because we understand human history not only in the post - colonial sense but from ancient times . 
India ' s ancient civilization , its spiritual heritage , its accomplishments of the human spirit in art and culture give her a unique standpoint from which we look upon the passing world . 
This is even more true for the continent of Africa , often known as the cradle of civilization , the land where the earliest forms of life were formed , whose ancient rocks contain the secrets of evolution , the land where the human beings as we know ourselves today , first learned to walk on two feet . 
India and Africa understand each other because our lands are the very definition of diversity . 
Be it physical diversity - from the snows of Kilimanjaro to the deep Sahara - or the multiplicity of religions , ethnicities , tribes , languages , dialects , and cultures . Africa has it all . 
So indeed does India . For Africa and India , diversity is our lifeblood ; it enriches us and makes us even stronger . 
It ensures that we value coexistence , dialogue , mutual understanding and peace . 
These are perspectives on the human development that India and Africa share , these are perspectives that we can together contribute to the rest of the world for handling conflicts and crises . 
The difficult decades may well be behind us , the decades of colonial rule and cruel oppression , of economic deprivation and racial discrimination . 
But the challenges are far from gone ; they have changed . 
We have still to overcome poverty and disease , terrorism and drug trafficking , lack of education and training . 
Terrorism knows no boundaries or borders and has no ideology except that of wanton destruction . 
India and Africa must work together to address this threat and strive to strengthen the international regime against terrorism . 
I was the Minister of External Affairs when we started the India - Africa Forum Summit in April 2008 . 
I vividly recall our collective enthusiasm and joy at the inaugural event that elevated India’s traditional warm and friendly ties with Africa to a new level in a structured format . 
The Third India - Africa Forum Summit is a demonstration of the importance we attach to our relation with Africa . 
The active participation of all countries of Africa at this Forum reflects the desire of member countries to build an enduring partnership between our nations and our peoples . 
India and Africa are neighbours linked together by the blue of the Indian Ocean . 
Our partnership is anchored in the fundamental principles of equality , mutual respect and mutual benefit . 
India commits to assist Africa in charting its own course through infrastructure development , institution building and technical and vocational skill development . 
India’s development partnership with Africa complements the various priorities setout in the Agenda 2063 vision document adopted by the African Union . 
An area of cooperation very close to my heart and pertinent to our interaction is ‘Agriculture’ . 
I remember well the days before India had its ‘green revolution’ and we were not self - sufficient in food . In those days , we literally lived from " ship to mouth” . 
Hunger and food scarcity under any circumstance is unacceptable and should lead all of us into collective action . 
Though India today is self - sufficient in food production , the land available for agriculture is continuously decreasing due to rising population . 
Africa is , fortunately , blessed with large areas of fertile , cultivable land . 
It is relevant to recall here the words of Kwameh Nkrumah , the first President of Ghana , who had rightly pointed out that " the Congo Basin alone can produce enough food crops to satisfy the requirements of nearly half the population of the whole world” . 
Agricultural growth is not only important in addressing Africa’s quest of food security but it also remains a key component of Africa’s overall development . 
I am sure that the interactions you and your delegations had in the past few days would have discussed collaboration in the areas of increasing productivity ; smart agriculture ; environment - friendly farm mechanization ; promotion of gene pool and better seeds , and other modern agricultural concepts . 
As we have stood together during the days of struggle , so too will we stand together in this challenging dawn of development . India is ready to share its democratic experience , its agricultural expertise , its capacity building potential , its healthcare institutions , its peacekeepers with our partners from Africa . 
Once again we are determined that our struggle will be based on principles - the principles of equality and partnership , of mutual benefit , of human dignity . 
For India and Africa , guided by the vision of Mahatma Gandhi who belonged to both , that is the only path . 
With these words , I once again welcome you to this evening of celebration of India - Africa relations—and the success of the Third India - Africa Forum Summit . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF A COPY OF THE BOOK , “INDIAN FAMILY BUSINESS MANTRAS”
It is a great privilege for me to receive the first copy of the book titled " Indian Family Business Mantras” which has been co - authored by Mr . Peter Leach and Mr . Tatwamasi Dixit . 
I appreciate their sincere attempt to educate and empower the community at large on how Indian family businesses function . 
I would like to express my gratitude to the authors for handing over the first copy of the book to me . 
Family and business have been interconnected since time immemorial . 
While family is one of the oldest surviving social systems , family business is the oldest surviving economic system . 
Business history is witness to the fact that most countries have family businesses playing significant roles in the development of the economies in their respective countries . 
Historically in India , the business community primarily consisted of traders . 
Indian business men have gradually transitioned from the traders’ activities and traders’ identity to manufacturers and various other value added business houses . 
The trade has evolved over centuries . 
But the concept of ‘family business’ has remained intact . 
Interestingly , even today family business contributes to 60 - 70 % of the GDP of our country and 40 - 50 % of the employment . 
In this book " Indian Family Business Mantras’ the authors have explicitly detailed the nuances in the life cycle of a family business . 
The real life examples given in the book , offers meaningful insights into business families on managing themselves effectively , dealing with conflicts and challenges as a family and the strategic value of staying together as a member of the business family . 
It weaves the Indian philosophy with the western context to bring out a whole new dimension to managing the family business . 
The Indian industry is largely dominated by family businesses . 
Family businesses have always been a matter of great curiosity as they are distinctively different from non - family businesses in their entrepreneurial , managerial and organizational structures , behaviors and styles , though they possess the fundamental qualities of growth which are inclusiveness , resilience , and sustainability . 
Whether in India or elsewhere , there are no general remedies : every family business is unique , shaped by its own set of distinctive personalities , their concerns , objectives and relationships , as well as by a host of other personal and commercial characteristics . 
This book captures the essence of the Indian Family Business beautifully . 
I wish the authors the best of luck in their future endeavors . 
Thank you once again . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT HEBREW UNIVERSITY
Chairman of the Board of Governors , Mr . Michael Federmann
President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Prof . Menahem Ben Sasson
Rector of the Hebrew University , Prof . Asher Cohen
H’ble Members of the Senate of Hebrew University of Jerusalem
Members of the Faculty and distinguished members of the academic community of this ancient University
I am delighted to visit the Hebrew University and be amidst you today . 
It is indeed a great honour for me to be the first Indian President to make a State Visit to Israel . 
Since my arrival , I have been touched by the warmth and friendly sentiments of the people of Israel . 
I would like to express my gratitude to the Hebrew University for honouring me today with the Doctor Philosophiae Honoris Causa . 
I greatly value this gesture of friendship . 
I , therefore , accept this doctorate as the President of India , on behalf of the people of India . 
It gives me great pleasure to be associated with this world famous University , one of Israel’s largest research and teaching institutions . 
I am aware of its magnificent libraries and their famed collections of manuscripts and ancient publications on Jewish thought and culture . 
I hope to someday have the opportunity to see some of these as well as the Albert Einstein Archives preserved here . 
India attaches great importance to its friendship and partnership with the people of Israel . 
Our earliest linkages date back more than two thousand years . 
As you may be aware , India has a significant Jewish population descended from Jewish communities who came to India as far back as 175 BC . 
Hebrew has been taught as a subject in our educational institutions long before the State of Israel was established . 
In modern times , our two peoples seem to have naturally revived these old affinities and embarked on a path of cooperation that has evolved into a close and multi - faceted partnership between our two nations . 
As young nations with an ancient history , both India and Israel seek to develop and progress as knowledge economies . 
In the 20 years since we normalised relations , we have developed a close partnership in key sectors of defence , agriculture , cyber security and advanced technology . 
I come at a time when India is at the threshold of a new era of modernisation and economic growth . 
Our Government has taken a number of initiatives to encourage foreign direct investments and stimulate the manufacturing sector of the Indian economy . 
The ‘Make in India’ and the ‘Jan Dhan Yojna’ for financial inclusion are two of many new initiatives undertaken by our Government . 
With Israel , India has a number of complementarities in many key sectors . 
We are keen to realise the full potential of a partnership between our scientists and researchers . 
Both our academic communities have much to bring to the table . 
Eminent Vice Chancellors of premier Indian Universities have accompanied me on this visit to explore and pursue possible collaborations with counterpart universities in areas of shared interest . 
They hope to foster mutually beneficial academic exchanges , collaborative research and cross pollination of ideas between Indian and Israeli institutions of higher learning . 
India trains nearly 400 , 000 engineers every year . Israel , on its part , has proven itself in the field of research and technical innovation . 
India seeks Israel’s participation in our Digital India programme and the building of India’s smart cities and model villages . 
Your ideas and innovations could go a long way in achieving the goals of these flagship programmes of our Government . 
I invite you all to participate in the transformation of India . 
Many of you may have travelled to India and some of you may be contemplating a visit . 
Travel itself is an educative and enriching experience . 
Our Government has selected Israel among the few countries to which it has extended the e - tourist visa facility . 
We do believe that increased exchanges at multiple levels will enhance the mutual understanding between our peoples . 
At the Knesset yesterday , I stressed the importance of institutionalising regular exchanges between our elected representatives . 
I am accompanied by the H’ble Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment , Mr . Thaawar Chand Gehlot and a multi party delegation of H’ble Members of the Indian Parliament . 
They join me in inviting you to visit India and contribute to the strengthening of the friendship between our peoples . 
Since my arrival in Israel , I have frequently been asked how India is managing the largest functional democracy despite its huge diversity . 
We see unity in this diversity . 
India is a complex country of 1 . 3 billion people , 122 languages , 1600 dialects , 7 religions and a substantial presence of all three major ethnic groups – Caucasian , Dravidian and Mongoloid . 
’As I have often said , its strength lies in its unique capacity to blend apparent contradictions into positive affirmations . 
In the words of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , India is a country held together and I quote " by strong but invisible threads… . About her there is the elusive quality of a legend of long ago ; some enchantment seems to have held her mind . She is a myth and an idea , a dream and a vision and yet , very real and present and pervasive " . 
With these words , Mr . President , I thank you once again . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE BANQUET HOSTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF ISRAEL
Your Excellency Mr . Reuven Rivlin , President of the State of Israel
It is indeed a privilege for me to make the first ever State Visit by an Indian President to Israel . 
The Nobel Laureate , Shai Agnon once said " if we breathe the scent of goodly grass , the fragrances of spices , the aroma of good fruits , we pronounce a blessing over the pleasure " . 
I wish to begin by thanking you , Mr . President for the warmth of the welcome that I have received , the graciousness of your hospitality and the friendship of your people . 
Mr . President , we , in India , know you as a man of courage and conviction . 
You lead a country that has faced many trials and tribulations throughout its history but whose people have always risen to the challenges that have confronted them . 
Israel’s leaders have guided their countrymen on a path of hard work , innovation and rapid progress . 
Their efforts have made them what they are today – a proud , confident and self reliant people . 
My visit is taking place at a time when our bilateral relations can be described as excellent . 
In fact , the linkages between India and Israel date back many centuries . 
According to records , the people of India first welcomed members of the lost tribes of Israel around 175 BC – more than 2000 years ago . 
They were followed by different groups who were similarly integrated into the Indian society . It was not long before their religious traditions also became a part of India ' s composite culture .

It was not long before their religious traditions also became a part of India ' s composite culture . 
Hebrew has been taught as a subject in our educational system much before the State of Israel was established . 
Our society was enriched by the contributions of the Indian Jews , who became famous poets , actors , teachers , industrialists and even generals in the Indian army . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE TO THE KNESSET
H’ble Mr . Yuli Edelstein , Speaker of the Knesse
I feel deeply honoured to be the first Indian President to make a State Visit to Israel . 
Since I arrived here yesterday , I have been touched by the warmth of the reception and the gracious hospitality that has been accorded to me and to my delegation . 
It is indeed an honour to be invited to the Knesset to address the distinguished representatives of the people of Israel . 
I bring to you the warm greetings and goodwill of the people of India . 
Distinguished Members of the Knesset
Having participated intensely in the deliberations of the Indian Parliament since I was first elected to the Upper House in 1969 , I feel very much at home when I visit other great Parliaments of the world . 
And this is one such occasion . 
The Knesset , with its unicameral structure and responsibilities of making the Basic Laws that substitute a written Constitution , has proved the power of parliamentary discussion and debate . 
Having been a Parliamentarian and public servant for over fifty years , I am , today , more convinced than ever , that a thorough deliberation - with due consideration of all shades of opinion - is the key to good policy making . 
I am accompanied today by the Honourable Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment , Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot and a delegation of Members of the Lower House of the Indian Parliament including H’ble Prof . K . V . Thomas of the Indian National Congress , Mrs . Meenakshi Lekhi , Prof . Dr . Subhash Bhamre , Shri Prathap Simha and Shri Vinod Chavda of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and Prof . Dr . Anupam Hazra of the Trinamool Congress . 
They represent different political parties and constituencies across the length and breadth of India . 
In fact , the Indian Parliament is a microcosm of the Indian sub - continent and it symbolizes , in every sense , the unity , strength and diversity of the Indian people . 
As you are doubtless aware , the general elections which took place in India last year was the largest democratic exercise of the right to vote in living history . 
The turnout was unprecedented – and the outcome historic : for the first time in 30 years , the Indian electorate had voted for a majority Government . 
I am happy to say that as President of India voted to office at the time of the previous Government , I had the satisfaction of presiding over a very smooth transition - from one democratically elected Government to another . 
Like the Knesset , the Indian Parliament has all the important functions of a legislative branch that checks the Executive branch of the Indian Government , questions its actions and thoroughly examines its policies . 
It makes laws and has wide financial powers . 
No tax can be levied without its approval and no expenditure can be incurred without its authorisation and sanction . 
My State Visit to Israel is taking place at a time when relations between our two Governments and our people are on a very positive trajectory . 
India and Israel , as fellow democracies , share many commonalities . 
The linkages between our peoples date back to ancient times . 
The first group of persecuted Jews who came to India landed on her western coast more than two thousand years ago . 
Throughout their long history , the Jewish communities in India have maintained , developed and enriched their traditions with many Indian additions to their unique heritage . 
The Jewish people have been - and will always be - an integral part of India’s composite society . 
Both India and Israel made parallel struggles against British rule . 
Our leaders adopted different methods but were inspired by the same human values and ideals . 
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Mahatma Gandhi is the only world leader whose photograph had been kept by former Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion in his desert home . 
In the period after independence , our countries travelled different paths . 
The Indian people have , nonetheless , always appreciated Israeli innovations in the field of agriculture , the kibbutzsystem and the remarkable achievements of your scientists and engineers . 
We admire the will and resolve with which the Jewish people have risen from the depths of unspeakable suffering and deprivation with a strong spirit and built their nation to make it what it is today - a thriving , progressive and prosperous society that leads the world in so many fields . 
Whenever the Nobel Prizes are announced , we often see names of scientists who have studied in the Hebrew University or Technion . As friends of Israel , we rejoice in your success . 
Our two countries established full diplomatic relations in 1992 . 
Since then , our co - operation in different fields has grown steadily . 
ndia remembers , with gratitude , the help that the Israeli Government provided in rushing critical defence supplies to India when we required them most urgently in 1999 . 
We also appreciate the support that we have received from Israel for India’s rightful claim to a permanent seat in the UN Security Council . 
India has been a strong voice of developing countries in the UN and other multilateral organisations . 
India believes that there is no better option than to resolve issues through negotiations and peaceful dialogue . 
We see that the administrative architecture of international bodies is not effective enough in enforcing their decisions . 
The United Nations was established at the end of the Second World War . 
Today its organisations need to be more responsive to the challenges that the world faces – and its structure as well as administrative and financial architecture need reform to make them more reflective of the changed world . 
India’s consistent policy has been to build a strong , substantive and mutually beneficial relationship with Israel . 
We will continue to do so through high - level visits and exchanges so that India - Israel relations are accorded the utmost priority . 
As we approach the 25th anniversary of the establishment of full diplomatic relations , we both seek to expand the vision of our future partnership . 
The Government of India has taken some new initiatives in economic policies and has been emphasising innovation , research and technological development to accelerate India’s social and economic transformation . 
These policies are aimed at raising India’s agricultural productivity , promoting manufacturing for employment generation and boosting the services industry . 
Excellencies , Agriculture is the mainstay of the Indian economy . 
In this vital sector , our Government’s policy has been to grow more crop - per - drop . 
Our farmers face the challenges of uneven distribution of water - we often have floods in one part of the country while there is drought in another . 
Our scientists should collaborate to deal with these challenges . 
We also seek assistance to clean our rivers , particularly the holy Ganga . 
To stimulate our domestic manufacturing sector , Government of India has launched an ambitious " Make in India” campaign . 
Israeli innovation and technology can combine with Indian engineering and scale to manufacture in India . 
In both our countries , the service sector is growing fast . 
This is another area where we have complementary strengths . 
India is one of the largest exporters of software in the world . 
Every year more than 400 , 000 English - speaking engineers graduate from Indian universities . 
The number of start - ups in India is expected to cross 10 , 000 in the next two years . 
I am happy that the Israeli Government has opened a Consulate in Bangalore , India’s ‘Silicon Plateau’ . 
As Visitor of 114 institutions of higher learning in India , I have personally placed a great deal of emphasis on developing educational linkages between Indian institutions and universities abroad . 
India produces first rate managers and engineers who are highly regarded by global companies . 
The current CEOs of both Microsoft and Google are graduates of Indian engineering colleges . 
In the coming decade , the emphasis in our educational institutions will be to strengthen innovation and research . 
A delegation of Vice Chancellors of Indian universities and scientific institutions is accompanying me on this visit . 
I am confident that their contacts with Israeli counterparts will result in a variety of partnerships in a range of areas - from space and cyber security to the building of ‘smart’ cities . 
India is delighted that Israeli citizens , particularly the younger generation , enjoy travelling to India . 
They rightly see India as a safe and welcoming destination where they always feel at home . 
I am told that Hebrew is spoken in some villages in northern India , whose populations also enjoy hummus . 
The Jewish community in India has always been an integral part of India’s social , economic and cultural mosaic . 
Recently local authorities have renovated the synagogues of Peravoor and Chennamangalam near Cochin in Kerala . 
These institutions are a proud testimony to the Indian Jewish tradition . 
I was told by one of the Indian Jews in Israel that his village in Cochin is , perhaps , the only place in the world where a synagogue , a mosque , a temple and a church co - exist peacefully on the same street . 
The Jews of Mumbai have left their mark on the architectural heritage of the city , its banking world , its literary scene and even Bollywood . 
India and Israel are separated by two seas but joined by their common belief in the power of diversity and democracy . 
The Knesset has , this year , entered the 50th year of its existence in this magnificent , " green’’ building . 
As I extend my felicitations to the H’ble Members of the Knesset , I once again thank you for the honour of addressing you . 
I invite you all to visit India to further engage with your parliamentary counterparts and contribute to the enrichment of our bilateral discourse . 
ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE CONFERMENT OF HONORARY DOCTORATE BY AL QUDS UNIVERSITY
I thank the President of the Al - Quds University for his generous words . 
I would like to begin by reciprocating his warm sentiments . 
I am touched by the gesture of this prestigious University in conferring upon me an Honorary Doctorate . 
I value it as a sign of friendship and regard of the people of Palestine for the people of India and for me . 
I accept this honour with deep humility in my capacity as President of India and on behalf of its people . 
I thank the Presidents and senior representatives of all the universities in Palestine , the Minister of Education and the H’ble Prime Minister , Mr . Rami Hamdallah and to convey to them that I am proud to be associated with this premier institution of higher education . 
I am aware that this University has contributed significantly towards the pursuit of academic excellence . 
In this , it has been inspired by the vision that only an educated and enlightened citizenry can safeguard the future of Palestine . 
Your pursuit of scientific knowledge and advanced research places this University at the centre of Palestine ' s national development programme . 
I am in Palestine on the first ever State Visit by an Indian President . 
It is therefore a great privilege for me to have this opportunity of visiting you . 
My visit reflects the keen interest of India in further deepening the rich and historic relationship that we have with Palestine . 
India ' s solidarity with the Palestinian people and its principled support to the Palestinian cause is rooted in our own freedom struggle . 
Over the years our approach to Palestine crystallized into a policy with three core dimensions : 
Solidarity with the Palestinian people ; support to the Palestinian cause ; and support to Palestine ' s nation building and capacity building efforts . 
India has always been at the forefront in promoting the Palestinian cause – India voted against the partition of Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly in 1947 . 
We recognized the PLO as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in 1974 ; India was the first non - Arab country to recognize the State of Palestine in 1988 . 
We spearheaded the campaign for recognition of Palestinian statehood by the UN in 2012 . 
India supported the successful resolution for flying the Palestinian flag at the UN Headquarters last month . We congratulate the people of Palestine on the momentous unfurling of their national flag at the United Nations - for the first time in history - on September 30 , 2015 . 
India had co - sponsored a draft resolution on " the right of Palestinians to self - determination " during the 53rd session of the UN General Assembly . 
India then voted in favour of UN General Assembly Resolution in October 2003 against construction of the separation wall by Israel and supported subsequent resolutions of the UNGA in this regard . 
India voted in favour of accepting Palestine as a full member of UNESCO . 
These strong foundations and our shared belief in peace , prosperity and development for the people of Palestine propel us to do more . 
One of the aims of my visit to Palestine is to suggest a framework for the future of our relationship . 
While we continue to follow our traditional policy on Palestine , we see that the framework of our partnership can be reinforced through three principal pillars , these are : 
First , closer political interaction ; 
Second , deeper economic engagement and academic collaboration ; 
Third , wider cultural contacts and people - to - people exchanges . 
India shares the perception that the Palestinian issue is at the center of Arab - Israeli conflict . 
Peace and stability in the region is in India ' s interest . 
Today the speed with which an event happening in one place of the world triggers a response in another , is unprecedented in terms of its impact and scale . 
There are a number of areas of convergence in our relationship which we may step up further by intensifying our exchange of information . 
At the multilateral level , we have already started the process with the League of Arab States . 
The expansion of our economic ties will surely present great new opportunities . 
I know that brand India is popular here and inspires trust . 
Government of India’s ' Make in India ' scheme welcomes all of you to manufacture in India . 
India can facilitate your journey from being consumers to manufacturers . 
We are confident of the abundant talent and entrepreneurship of the Palestinian people . 
Apart from our bilateral trade in goods , there is vast scope for trade in services . 
India ' s strength in IT and IT - enabled services as well as consultancy can pave the way for greater engagement in the IT sector . 
I had the privilege to inaugurate the India - Palestine Center for Excellence in ICT today . 
It will have a satellite centre in Ramallah and forward linkages with industry . 
India will build a similar Center in Gaza . 
We look forward to the success of the Techno - Park in Ramallah . 
It will be jointly built and operated by the Palestine Investment Fund and the Indian public and private sector . 
India has always been happy to partner Palestine in promoting education . 
Over the years , around 12 , 000 Palestinian students have graduated from Indian Universities , many of them on scholarships offered by the Government of India . 
Today , these students serve as a bridge between our two countries . 
It is also a good sign that scholarships offered by the ICCR are usually utilized in full by Palestine . 
It gives me great pleasure to announce that my Government has decided to increase the number of these scholarships from 10 to 25 per annum . 
I also take this opportunity to announce the setting up of an India - Chair in the Al Quds University . 
Friends , India is proud to have built the Jawaharlal Nehru Library at the Al Azhar University in Gaza city ; and the Mahatma Gandhi Library - cum - Student Activity Centre at the Palestine Technical College at Deir Al Balah in Gaza . 
We are glad to have built the Jawaharlal Nehru Secondary School for Girls in Asira Al - Shamaliya . 
Today , I will inaugurate the Jawaharlal Nehru Secondary School for Boys in Abu Dees . 
India is also happy to have equipped seven Vocational Training Centres in Palestine . 
I have noted with satisfaction the successful conclusion of the first ever India - Palestine Academic Round Table this morning . 
I recognise the contributions made by H’ble Minister of Education H . E . Mr . Sabri Saidam , Presidents of the different Palestinian Universities and the representatives of premier Indian universities in making this event a success . 
This interaction marks a quantum leap in our academic relations . 
MoUs signed today will facilitate our continued engagement and pave the way for joint R & D and innovation , student and faculty exchanges etc . 
As Visitor of 114 central institutes of higher learning in India , I am aware of their enthusiasm for global partnerships . 
India has long been committed to the capacity building efforts of Palestine under the ITEC scholarship Programme . 
As of date , 760 Palestinian nationals have availed training under this scheme . 
I am happy to announce that the Government of India has increased the ITEC slots for Palestine from 50 to 100 per annum . 
We welcome the interest of our Palestinian friends in Indian culture and , particularly in Yoga . 
Both our peoples cherish the fact that our cultural connections go back to our ancient history . 
The Indian Hospice located in East Jerusalem bears testimony to this fact . 
We look forward to strengthening these ancient linkages . 
With these words , I once again thank the Al Quds University for bestowing upon me this honour . 
I look forward to your continued friendship and fruitful exchanges with India . 
The youth of Palestine are the future leaders of this country . 
May you flourish and take your nation to new heights of progress and prosperity . 
I wish all of you every success in your academic careers and a very bright future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT ABBAS ' REMARKS AT THE STATE BANQUET
Your Excellency , President Mahmoud Abbas , President of the State of Palestine
It is indeed a great privilege to be here on the first State Visit to Palestine by an Indian President . 
I thank Your Excellency for your gracious words . 
I deeply appreciate the warm welcome and the generous hospitality accorded to me and my delegation . 
Your Excellency , the Palestinian leadership have displayed great faith and trust in relations with India . 
This has been evident during the visits of Your Excellency and late President Yasser Arafat to India . 
At the very outset allow me to congratulate you on the historic installation of the national flag of Palestine at the United Nations on September 30 , 2015 . 
We share your pride and joy on this momentous occasion and also your sense of optimism that this is an important step towards the realization of the dream of the people of Palestine for a separate homeland . 
Your Excellency , India attaches great importance to its long standing friendship with Palestine . 
India ' s empathy with the Palestinian cause and its friendship with the people of Palestine have become an integral part of our foreign policy . 
India has always stood beside Palestine . 
India ' spolicy on Palestine has three core dimensions : solidarity with the Palestinian people ; support to the Palestinian cause ; and , partnership in Palestine ' s nation and capacity building efforts . 
The Indian leadership , across the political spectrum , remains unwavering and steadfast in its support for the Palestinian cause . 
India is also keen to work with Palestine on the orientation and framework for our future relationship - based on the three pillars of closer political interactions : deeper economic engagement and academic collaboration ; and wider cultural contacts and people - to - people exchanges . 
Your Excellency , peace and stability in the region is in India ' s interest . 
We share the perception that resolution of the longstanding Palestinian issue will contribute to the peace and stability of the region . 
We are , therefore , concerned about the stalled peace process . 
India supports a negotiated solution , resulting in a sovereign , independent , viable and united State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital . 
We would like to see the people of Palestine living within secure and recognized borders , side by side and at peace with Israel , as endorsed in the Arab Peace Initiative , the Quartet road map and relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions . 
We firmly believe that dialogue is the only viable option in the search for a just , durable , comprehensive and peaceful solution of the Palestinian issue . 
Diplomacy and statesmanship have to prevail over hatred and violence in the search for lasting and durable peace . 
I would like to share my sincere hope of early resumption of the peace process between all relevant parties and pray that it will soon lead to the amicable resolution of conflict in this region . 
Excellency , I am confident that the discussions we have had during my visit will lead to fruitful engagement and meaningful outcomes in all areas of our mutual interest . 
In order to continue the tradition of friendly consultations between us , I would like to invite Your Excellency to visit India at a mutually convenient time . 
It would be an honour to receive you in New Delhi . 
With these words , Excellency , I thank you once again for your gracious hospitality and wish you every success in your endeavours for peace and progress in Palestine . 
I would also like to convey through you , the warm greetings of the people of India to their brothers and sisters in Palestine and our sincere wishes for their all round advancement , happiness and prosperity in the days to come . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE CONFERMENT OF HONORARY DOCTORATE BY THE UNIVERSITY OF JORDAN
I feel honoured to address this distinguished gathering at the prestigious University of Jordan , one of the oldest andmostacclaimed centres of learning in the world . 
I would like to begin byexpressing my gratitudeto H . E . Professor Dr . Tarawneh for his generous words and to the University of Jordan for conferring an Honorary Doctorate on me . 
I am deeply movedby this gesture . 
I value it as a manifestation of the warmth of the people of Jordan towards me and my country . 
I have long been aware of the grand reputation of the University of Jordan . 
I have heard of its contribution in the building of a knowledge society in this country . 
Its role in promoting fundamental human values , academic freedom , learning and innovation has been second to none . 
Today , as I address you , and through you , the people of Jordan , I feel that I could not have chosen a better venue than this esteemed institution . 
India attaches high importance to its friendship with Jordan . 
I have come here , inspired by our common history and encouraged by our mutual goodwill , seeking to open a new chapter in our age - old relationship . 
Since our two independent nations established our diplomatic relations in 1950 , our co - operation has expanded in a variety of areas of shared interest . 
India was among the first countries to welcome the Wadi Araba Treaty of The Kingdom of Jordan with Israel in October 1994 . 
Our nations have , over the years , consolidated our partnership by establishing institutional mechanisms andundertakingregular high - level exchanges . 
India values the personal contribution of His Majesty , Late King Hussein bin Talal ( May his soul rest in peace ) and Their Majesties King Adbullah II and Queen Rania in reinforcing the warmth and understanding between India and Jordan . 
This mutual sentiment has beenstrengthened by some unusual events that have become landmarks in the history of our bilateral relations . 
India recalls , with gratitude , Jordan’s invaluable assistance in the emergency evacuation of over 150 , 000 Indians from Kuwait and Iraq during the Gulf Crisis in 1991 and again in 2004 when our people fled the civil war in Iraq . 
Over the years , our relationship has been further enhanced by the excellent understanding between our Governments on regional and global issues and our support for each other in multilateral fora including the United Nations . 
Our convergence of views on Palestine , the Middle East Peace Process , Syria , Iraq and the challenges confronting us in this region today - and our agreement on the need to expedite UNSC reforms reflect our common approach to these important issues . 
India has an unflinching commitment to sustaining and expanding relations with the Arab world . 
Our ties are ancient and civilisational . 
West Asia is a vital part of India’s extended neighbourhood and millions of Indians live and work here . 
We commend Jordan ' s active and untiring efforts for peace in the region . 
India has always appreciatedthe vision of His Majesty , the Late King Hussein ( May his soul rest in peace ) and His Majesty , King Abdullah in pursuing , with all concerned at both the regional and the global level , a just solution to the Palestine - Israel issues . 
Like Jordan , India’s traditional support to the Palestinian cause remains steadfast and unwavering while we pursue strong relations with Israel . 
Our bilateral relations with Israel are independent of our relations with Palestine . 
India supports a negotiated solution resulting in a sovereign , independent , viable and united State of Palestine , with East Jerusalem as its capital , living within secure and recognized borders . 
We desire to see Palestine living side by side at peace with Israel as endorsed in the Quartet Roadmap and relevant UNSC Resolutions . 
India has played a proactive role in garnering support for this cause in all multilateral fora . 
We have called upon both sides to exercise restraint and work towards a comprehensive resolution of the Palestinian issue . 
We have been happy to provide budgetary , economic and developmental assistance to Palestine . 
I would like to recall the words of Mahatma Gandhi , as also quoted by Her Majesty , Queen Noor in her recent book , " Leap of Faith ' and I quote , " Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English and France to the French " . 
India stands ready to work with all like - minded nations for the amicable resolution of this protracted conflict . 
India also remains deeply concerned at the ongoing violence in Syria . 
We are saddened by the tragic loss of lives and the long suffering of millions of displaced citizens - including innocent women and children . 
We laud Jordan’s humanitarian assistance and sheltering of 1 . 4 million refugees - despite its own severe domestic constraints ; and believe that this human tragedy should never have been allowed to happen in the first place . 
India has been consistently calling for all sides in the Syrian conflict to abjure violence so that conditions can be created for an inclusive political dialogue . 
We see this as the only path to a comprehensive , permanent , political solution as there can be no military solution to this conflict . 
We have been stating that such a dialogue must take into account the legitimate aspirations of the people of Syria . 
India believes that Syria has a key and fundamentalpart to playin achieving peace and stability inWest Asia . 
Prolonged conflict in Syria has already begun to have a severe impact on the region and beyond . 
The fragile security situation in Iraq is , no less , a matter of grave concern . 
The rise of intolerance and sectarian violence calls for a comprehensive approach for achieving a political solution in Iraq . 
On our part , India is committed to non - interference in the internal affairs of other countries . 
However , we are directly affected by terror and strife in this region . 
We sincerely desire stability and prosperity for the friendly people of Iraq with whom also we have close ties that are ancient and civilisational . 
I am reminded of the prophetic words of Mahatma Gandhi , Father of our Nation , which I would like to share with you as they have proven to be more relevant now than ever before . 
I quote , ”What difference does it make to the dead , the orphans and the homeless , whether the mad destruction is wrought in the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy . ? ”
The high academic and culturaltradition of the Arab world is not only well known to us in India , but it is inseparably linked to our own . 
We know that Arab masters translated and preserved teachings from Greece , India and Persia , inspiring a mass movement in the field of education during the 12th Century . 
This resurgence produced the great Arab mathematicians , scientists and scholars . 
Regular cross pollination of theories and concepts inspired thought , exploration and discoveries that changed the world . 
We , in India , cherished these invaluable exchanges and collaborations that enriched our traditions of learning , culture , religion , language and people to people contacts . 
The weakening of these links over the decades due to a variety of reasons can certainly be remedied . 
A re - connect of Arab and Asian ideas and culture will undoubtedly enrich humanity once again . 
There is wide popular support in both our countries for enhancing our relations . 
My visit reflects India ' s deep interest in strengthening our partnership with Jordan in every field . 
We admire Jordan ' s endeavour , guided by the vision of His Majesty King Abdullah , to modernise its educational infrastructure and develop in its youth a scientific temper while preserving all the richness of Jordan’s cultural heritage . 
It is a vindication of your investment in these values that you have succeeded in building a modern , inclusive and pluralistic nation while the rest of the region remains entrapped in continuous cycles of conflict and instability . 
Your success is , therefore as important for the region as it is for the world . India has always recognised the importance of education in social empowerment and a nation ' s progress . 
This assumes greater salience and urgency at this time - when the world is tackling the challenges of unemployment and radicalization . 
Our strongest focus should remain on human resource development . 
We are happy to have partnered Jordan in training its students and professionals in India . 
I am told that the Jordanian alumni of various Indian universities are now 2500 strong . 
Our educational systems mustupgradeand fine tune themselves to better equip our youth for employment . 
The knowledge economy is an area where we can have promising collaborations . 
Friends , as Visitor of 114 institutions of higher education in India , I am deeply committed to fostering educational exchanges and cross pollination of ideas . 
Accompanying my official delegation are the Vice Chancellors of prominent Indian Universities and educational institutions in India . 
I am happy to see that Delhi University and the University of Jordan have signed an MOU for co - operation today . 
Several other Indian universities and premier institutions have also entered into understandings with their Jordanian counterparts . 
I am told that the University of Petra and Talal Abu Ghazaleh University are already in successful partnerships . 
Similar tie - ups for providing online education , could , if encouraged , afford vast opportunities for fruitful collaborations . 
India is emerging as one of the largest economies in the world . 
It has experienced an average annual growth rate of more than 7 per cent over the past decade , and is , presently , one of the fastest growing emerging markets in the world . 
India seeks greater Foreign Direct Investment in the insurance , construction , defence and railways sectors . 
We have opened up these sectors through policies that will encourage investors . 
Our bilateral trade with Jordan has crossed US $ 2 billion last year and we have set ourselves a trade target of US $ 5 billion by 2025 . 
We can achieve this if we expand the range of items in our trade basket , increase the share of high - technology and value - added products and enhance exchanges and cooperation in the services sector . 
Our priorities are healthcare , IT & IT - enabled services , financial services , transport and logistics . 
India has and will remain committed to peaceful recourse in its external as well as internal policies . 
Instability in our neighbourhood can threaten our security and slow down our progress . 
At a time when the entire world is affected by the scourge of terrorism , it is important to recognize that India has been preoccupied with this menace for over four decades . 
Terrorism emanating from our neighbourhood remains a major security threat to us . 
We believe that addressing this challenge should be a major priority of the international community . 
India believes that countries adopting a policy of selectiveness in identifying and dealing with terrorists - especially those who allow these forces to thrive on their territories - will eventually be endangered by the very same actors . 
Indiacondemned the brutal killing of the Jordanian pilot , Muath al - Kasasbeh . 
We commend Jordan ' s efforts in confronting the menace of terrorism and your participation in regional and international efforts in this direction . 
India has been actively working for strengthening theinternational regime against terrorism . 
We seek full and universal compliance , by all countries , with the counter - terrorism measures initiated under the aegis of the United Nations , particularly UN Security Council Resolution 1373 ( 2011 ) and United Nations Global Counter - Terrorism ( GCTS ) adopted in 2006 . 
India would like to see a collective effort by all the member States of the United Nations for the early conclusion and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism . 
It has been pending for over a decade . 
This Comprehensive Convention would serve the cause of humanity by prohibiting States from facilitating or allowing their territories to be used for terrorist acts . 
It would enable States to cooperate in suppressing terrorism and in punishing the perpetrators , abettors , financiers , facilitators and collaborators of terrorism . 
Friends , in my meetings with His Majesty , King Abdullah and the pragmatic leadership of Jordan , I have reflected on these concerns and objectives – particularly the goal of peace in this region . 
I am happy to share that I am convinced that under the guidance of His Majesty , King Abdullah II , Jordan will definitely reap the positive outcomes of all the efforts made for the development and progress of its people . 
The world also looks forward to the healing and renewal of the other great communities of this region . 
I wish His Majesty and the Government of Jordan every strength and unmitigated success as they provide leadership to this process . 
On the bilateral agenda between India and Jordan , I am now more confident than ever before that we are proceeding in the right direction . 
We both realise that we must seize the present opportune moment to work together and collaborate for our mutual benefit . 
The understandings that have been reached during my visit will undoubtedly enhance our mutual understanding and take our co - operation to new levels . 
Above all , Ladies and Gentlemen , as I see the young and optimistic faces of the young people around me today¸ I am inspired by the energy and hope that I perceive . 
I see in you the future – and a better and brighter world led by your enlightened generation . 
I wish all the students gathered here today every success in their academic careers . 
May your endeavours for peace and nation - building be fruitful . 
Once again , I thank you all and convey , through you , to the people of Jordan , my sincere wishes for the progress and the prosperity of your great country . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE TO INDIAN COMMUNITY AND FRIENDS OF INDIA
I am delighted to be here in Jordan on the very first State Visit by a President of India . 
At the very outset , I would like to offer you warm greetings of the Government and people of India . 
We have been looking forward to meeting you all . 
Although it is only a few hours since our arrival , I am sure I speak for my entire delegation when I say that our day has been memorable . 
The affection and goodwill that has been showered on us by the people of Amman since we arrived has made a lasting impression on us . 
Ambassador Trigunayat tells me that the Indian community and Jordanian friends , many of whom are present here today , have been playing an exceptional role in cementing the co - operation between Jordan and India . 
I have been made aware that the Indian community in Jordan have always been made to feel welcome and comfortable here . 
I thank His Majesty , King Abdullah II and the Government and friendly people of Jordan for creating an environment that has enabled our people to flourish and whole heartedly contribute to the progress and development of this great nation . 
The Government and people of India , too , bear the greatest goodwill and affection for the people of Jordan and look forward to taking forward our relations in all areas of common interest . 
I would like to share with you that I have had very good discussions with His Majesty , King Abdullah II today . 
I took the opportunity to thank His Majesty for the humanitarian assistance extended by Jordan in the evacuation of Indians from Iraq in the midst of the Gulf Crisis in 1991 and then again in 2014 when they fled from the troubled situation in Iraq . 
We , in India , greatly value the personal contribution of His Majesty and his Government to the enhancing of relations between Jordan and India . 
I am happy to say that my visit is taking place at a time when the Government of India has initiated a series of measures aimed at boosting the manufacturing sector in India , encouraging foreign direct investment and welcoming investors to participate in the development of India’s infrastructure . 
India is a fast - growing economy and expanding market . 
This is , therefore , an opportune moment for our two nations to identify synergies and build on them for the mutual benefit of our peoples . 
I will meet Prime Minister Dr . Abdullah Ensour and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh tomorrow . 
I will have the honour of representing the people of India at the naming of a prominent street after Mahatma Gandhi . 
This gesture is not only a tribute to the Father of our nation , but also a recognition of the enduring relevance of his universal message of peace and non violence . 
Friends , we in India consider the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to be an oasis of peace and progress in this region . 
We laud the progressive policies of His Majesty the King and deeply appreciate his humanity in offering refuge to almost one and a half million innocent men , women and children who have been displaced from their homes by the ravages of war . 
We appreciate his efforts and tireless endeavours within this region and beyond to inculcate tolerance and understanding amongst communities . 
We believe that it is urgent and imperative for all sides to give up sectarian violence and hatred and , instead , embrace tolerance , humanity and harmonious coexistence . 
Gandhiji , the Father of our nation believed , " It is the law of love that rules mankind . Had violence , i . e . hate , ruled us we should have become extinct long ago . And yet , the tragedy of it is that the so - called civilized men and nations conduct themselves as if the basis of society was violence” . 
Friends , like Jordan , India is a young nation . 
65 % of our population is less than 35 years of age . 
Almost 10 million young Indians join the job market every year . 
Both our nations are favourably placed to harness the unprecedented demographic dividend accruing to us . 
In order to create a conducive economic environment for achieving high and sustainable rates of growth over the next few decades , Government of India is focused on simplifying procedures , introducing greater accountability , enhancing informed decision making and rationalising our laws and regulations . 
I understand Jordan has also been taking similar measures to fulfil a similar commitment to its youth . 
However , even as governments implement facilitating measures , greater trade can be realised only if businesses on both sides participate wholeheartedly in this process . 
To this end , we , in India , are committed to furthering our ongoing co - operation with Jordan in areas of shared interest and complementarities . 
The MOUs and agreements for co - operation that will be signed during my visit will surely contribute to the efforts of our Governments in providing an expanded institutional framework for an efficient and result oriented engagement . 
I am happy to learn that large Indian business delegations have participated in Trade fairs in Jordan and after the recently held Joint Commission meeting ; the first Indo - Jordan CEOs Business Forum will be held in New Delhi later in the year . 
Our bilateral trade has crossed the USD 2 billion mark in 2014 . 
In fact , our total non - oil bilateral trade which was a mere US $ 570 million in 2006 has doubled to US $ 1 . 89 billion in 2014 . 
We have set a target of 5 billion USD of bilateral trade by 2025 ; which I believe is eminently achievable . 
India has emerged as the 4th largest trading partner of Jordan and is one of the main importer of rock phosphates , potash and finished fertilizers from here . 
The state of the art JIFCO Joint Venture project is an example of our successful collaboration . 
I have been told that Jordan is keen to see greater participation of Indian companies in a variety of areas such as transportation , Renewable Energy , IT and IT enabled services and Pharmaceutical sectors . 
I would encourage Indian investors to consider these avenues of cooperation . 
India’s initiative to extend the " E - Tourist Visa” facility to Jordanian nationals since last November is based on our commitment to increase tourism flows between our nations and encourage people to people contacts . 
We look forward to your full support and contribution to towards this end . 
With these words , Ladies and Gentlemen , I wish to reiterate how delighted I am to see your optimism and commitment towards reinforcing the ties between India and Jordan . I wish you success . 
I once again thank you and offer you my best wishes and those of the Indian people for your continued happiness , progress and prosperity . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NATIONAL AWARDS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS – VAYOSHRESHTHA SAMMAN – 2015
It is indeed a happy occasion for me to be present amidst you on the International Day of Older Persons . 
It is my privilege to honour , through the " Vayoshreshtha Samman” , individuals and institutions who have rendered outstanding services to the cause of the elderly . 
The International Day of Older Persons is an occasion to focus renewed attention on issues relating to the older people . 
In India , the life expectancy of people has gradually risen over the years . 
From 59 years in 1990 , the life expectancy at birth has increased to 66 years in 2013 . 
World over , the population of the aged is increasing . 
India is no exception . 
Though India has the largest number of the young in the world , but still there is a sizeable population of older persons as well . 
According to the 2011 Census , population in the 60 plus age bracket comprised 8 . 6 percent of the country’s total population which can be considered as elderly . 
The phenomenon of age dependency will strengthen in the years to come . 
This will give rise to a host of issues which needs to be dealt in a more comprehensive manner and with a greater sense of urgency . Older persons cannot wait indefinitely as time is also running out for them . 
The problems relating to old age are not experienced nor fully comprehended by the younger generation . 
There is a need to sensitize various strata of the society towards the challenges being faced by the elderly people . 
Social isolation , neglect , and lack of love , care and emotional support are the major deprivations generally faced by the older people . 
The younger generation must be willing to give more respect , love and care to the elderly , not only in their own family but also in the society at large . 
There is need to strengthen social bonding between the generations . 
The elderly face a plethora of physical problems , including reduced physical strength , decreased immunity , aggravation in ailments already present , onset of sensory and motor disabilities , weakened memory and decrease in intellectual prowess . 
Combination of adverse health conditions such as these can have serious implications on the physical , emotional and economic well - being of our senior citizens . 
If an elderly person is unable to secure specialized medical care due to lack of affordability or accessibility , it will compound the hardships already being faced by him or her . 
It is important that institutions to provide geriatric care be established , strengthened and made more affordable for the common man . 
The Indian tradition of respecting and caring for elders has been passed on from generations . 
They are considered as the most valuable part of the family . 
We must not let this socio - cultural asset of ours wither away . 
The societal transformation from joint to nuclear families notwithstanding , we must encourage in the younger lot the ability and keenness to facilitate ageing in their own homes . 
To realize this , the availability of geriatric care givers at affordable cost must be ensured . 
Institutions to provide training and skill acquisition in this field must be established in States where their deficiency or absence exists . 
Young people must be sensitized to acquire necessary skill and training . 
This would ensure that the ability of nuclear families to take proper care of senior citizens is not impeded by shortage of trained geriatric care givers . 
Facilities to provide institutional care to needy elderly persons must be established in sufficient numbers . 
States and local bodies must take the lead in ensuring that adequate mechanism to provide institutional care to the aged is available within the reach of the needy . 
The voluntary sector as well as the corporate sector must also be encouraged to set up institutional care centres to make available comprehensive care including geriatric healthcare facilities to the inmates . 
There are legislations at the Central and State levels to ensure the welfare of senior citizens . 
However in the backdrop of changing socio - economic conditions , the effectiveness and efficacy of these laws have to be constantly evaluated . 
If found necessary , the legal provisions have to be re - visited and requisite modifications carried out . 
A robust legal framework implemented with vigour would help ensure the safety , security and well - being of elderly persons in our country . 
The senior citizens too can play an important role in making their own lives fruitful and in enriching the society in which they live . 
By sharing their experience and wisdom , senior citizens can contribute towards the betterment of the society in no small measure . 
With these few words , I conclude . I once again offer my felicitations to all those who have been awarded with " Vayoshreshtha Samman " today . 
I wish all senior citizens of our society , particularly those who are present here , good health and happiness . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF THE PRESENTATION OF NATIONAL TOURISM AWARDS
I am , indeed , delighted to be here today . 
I join you in felicitating achievers in India’s Tourism industry . 
These exceptional individuals and institutions have distinguished themselves through their dedication in promoting India as a tourist destination . 
They have made outstanding contributions to the development of our tourism sector in terms of quality and capacity . 
I would like to congratulate the award winners . 
The honours conferred today will , no doubt , reinforce the commitment of all the stakeholders in the tourism sector and motivate them to work with renewed vigour for its expansion and growth . 
Tourism in our country is an agent of development and an engine for economic growth and employment generation . 
Trained human resource is an important component for the development of any sector . 
I am happy to know that the Ministry of Tourism has paid attention for creating trained human resources to meet the requirements of the tourism sector and the hospitality industry . 
The Institutes of Hotel Management ( IHMs ) , Indian Institute of Tourism and Travel Management ( IITTM ) and Food Craft Institutes ( FCIs ) provide avenues for getting education and training to serve in the tourism sector . 
The ‘Hunar - se - Rozgar Tak’ scheme of the Ministry of Tourism under which training is being provided to the youth is a laudable initiative for bringing social equity and employment opportunities to the weaker sections of the society . 
In 2014 , a total 1282 million domestic visits in India were recorded . 
In that year , India had 7 . 68 million foreign tourist arrivals registering a growth of 10 . 2 percent over the previous year . 
However , it comprised a mere 0 . 7 percent of the international tourist arrivals worldwide , which was 1 . 1 billion . Hence , there is tremendous scope for a manifold rise in tourist arrivals from abroad . 
The foreign exchange earnings from the tourism sector during 2014 were Rs . 1 . 2 lakh crore with a growth rate of 14 . 5 percent . 
I am glad to share with you that the implementation of e - Tourist Visa , for 113 countries , is showing excellent results . 
Many of the high potential countries like USA , UK , Spain , Malaysia , Germany , etc . now have the e - Tourist Visa facility . 
During January to July , 2015 , close to 1 . 5 lakh tourists arrived on our soil through e - Tourist Visa . 
With the growth of the Indian economy and the increase in disposable income of our people , we may expect tourist inflows to remain on a positive trajectory in the years to come . 
We must pay focussed attention to the building of a high quality tourism infrastructure in the country . 
The launch of two initiatives - Swadesh Darshan and PRASAD ( Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive ) - aiming at integrated development of circuits and pilgrim centres would go a long way in achieving this objective . 
The safety mechanisms that we create , the precautions that we put in place must reassure our guests - so that they never have to be apprehensive about their personal safety or that of their belongings . 
The Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to address the safety concerns of the tourists by launching 24x7 Incredible India Helpline to provide the tourists valuable information and to guide them during emergencies . 
The ‘Welcome Booklet’ being distributed at immigration counters containing information on Dos and Don’ts for tourists would also be a helpful aid for foreign tourists immediately on their arrival . 
Inconsistent sanitation standards would , similarly , have a negative impact . 
This would be unfortunate – especially at a time when our tourism industry is projecting the unique beauty of our cultural sites , the scenic splendour of our adventure destinations and the richness of our architectural heritage . 
The Ministry of Tourism’s ‘Swach Bharat - Swach Parayatan campaign’ to promote cleanliness and hygiene at tourist destinations is a welcome step in the right direction . 
It calls for all stakeholders to work together to achieve this goal in all aspects of the " India” experience . 
I would also stress that it is essential for the Tourism Ministry to take the lead and set the highest standards in this regard . 
It is equally important to develop systems for effective monitoring to ensure that these standards are maintained by establishments across the board . 
Quicker access to distant locations , larger disposable incomes and rising lifestyle aspirations now characterise the growing numbers of travellers . 
I urge the tourism industry to consciously plan its investments in a manner that the growth of this sector is sustained without compromising our natural and cultural heritage . 
New and innovative methods should be introduced to conserve energy and water . 
It should be incumbent on tourist establishments and hospitality units to operate in a way that they are able to reduce water and energy consumption , cut down on the generation of waste , improve waste management and ensure creative recycling and efficient waste disposal . 
Broader social contacts between tourists and receiving communities go a long way in enhancing mutual understanding , tolerance , and awareness between peoples . 
Tourism translates into closer collaboration and cultural exchanges across the nation and with distant communities all over the world . 
India offers one of the best tourism experiences in the world and I have no doubt that collectively we can earn India its rightful place in the tourism map of the world . 
I once again congratulate all those whose initiatives and hard work have won recognition today
I wish all of you great success in growing and expanding our tourism industry in the years to come . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NATIONAL AWARDS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS – VAYOSHRESHTHA SAMMAN – 2015
It is indeed a happy occasion for me to be present amidst you on the International Day of Older Persons . 
It is my privilege to honour , through the " Vayoshreshtha Samman” , individuals and institutions who have rendered outstanding services to the cause of the elderly . 
The International Day of Older Persons is an occasion to focus renewed attention on issues relating to the older people . 
In India , the life expectancy of people has gradually risen over the years . 
From 59 years in 1990 , the life expectancy at birth has increased to 66 years in 2013 . 
World over , the population of the aged is increasing . 
India is no exception . 
Though India has the largest number of the young in the world , but still there is a sizeable population of older persons as well . 
According to the 2011 Census , population in the 60 plus age bracket comprised 8 . 6 percent of the country’s total population which can be considered as elderly . 
The phenomenon of age dependency will strengthen in the years to come . 
This will give rise to a host of issues which needs to be dealt in a more comprehensive manner and with a greater sense of urgency . 
Older persons cannot wait indefinitely as time is also running out for them . 
The problems relating to old age are not experienced nor fully comprehended by the younger generation . 
There is a need to sensitize various strata of the society towards the challenges being faced by the elderly people . 
Social isolation , neglect , and lack of love , care and emotional support are the major deprivations generally faced by the older people . 
The younger generation must be willing to give more respect , love and care to the elderly , not only in their own family but also in the society at large . 
There is need to strengthen social bonding between the generations . 
The elderly face a plethora of physical problems , including reduced physical strength , decreased immunity , aggravation in ailments already present , onset of sensory and motor disabilities , weakened memory and decrease in intellectual prowess . 
Combination of adverse health conditions such as these can have serious implications on the physical , emotional and economic well - being of our senior citizens . 
If an elderly person is unable to secure specialized medical care due to lack of affordability or accessibility , it will compound the hardships already being faced by him or her . 
It is important that institutions to provide geriatric care be established , strengthened and made more affordable for the common man . 
The Indian tradition of respecting and caring for elders has been passed on from generations . 
They are considered as the most valuable part of the family . 
We must not let this socio - cultural asset of ours wither away . 
The societal transformation from joint to nuclear families notwithstanding , we must encourage in the younger lot the ability and keenness to facilitate ageing in their own homes . 
To realize this , the availability of geriatric care givers at affordable cost must be ensured . 
Institutions to provide training and skill acquisition in this field must be established in States where their deficiency or absence exists . 
Young people must be sensitized to acquire necessary skill and training . 
This would ensure that the ability of nuclear families to take proper care of senior citizens is not impeded by shortage of trained geriatric care givers . 
Facilities to provide institutional care to needy elderly persons must be established in sufficient numbers . 
States and local bodies must take the lead in ensuring that adequate mechanism to provide institutional care to the aged is available within the reach of the needy . 
The voluntary sector as well as the corporate sector must also be encouraged to set up institutional care centres to make available comprehensive care including geriatric healthcare facilities to the inmates . 
There are legislations at the Central and State levels to ensure the welfare of senior citizens . 
However in the backdrop of changing socio - economic conditions , the effectiveness and efficacy of these laws have to be constantly evaluated . 
If found necessary , the legal provisions have to be re - visited and requisite modifications carried out . 
A robust legal framework implemented with vigour would help ensure the safety , security and well - being of elderly persons in our country . 
The senior citizens too can play an important role in making their own lives fruitful and in enriching the society in which they live . 
By sharing their experience and wisdom , senior citizens can contribute towards the betterment of the society in no small measure . 
With these few words , I conclude . I once again offer my felicitations to all those who have been awarded with " Vayoshreshtha Samman " today . 
I wish all senior citizens of our society , particularly those who are present here , good health and happiness . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE 13TH CONVOCATION OF VISVESVARAYA NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
Iam happy to be amidst you to share this significant moment in your life . 
At the outset , I would like to congratulate those who have completed their degree programme from this prestigious Institute . 
I would also like to thank the management for inviting me to this Institute named after Sir M . Visvesvaraya , an eminent engineer , planner and statesman of our country . 
Today , while remembering this great son of India on his birth anniversary , I would like to quote hisphilosophy on technical education . 
He had said , No great improvement can be affected without definite ideals and organizations . 
Investigate , educate , organize” should be our watchwords if we are to quicken the life pulse of the people and train them for a larger and fuller life . 
I am happy that this Institute has taken steps to realize his philosophy and to sensitize the students to technology enhancement and social causes . 
I am confident that all the students passing out from this Institute will imbibe the ideals , vision , philosophy and professional qualities of Sir Visvesvaraya . 
I am also glad to know that the Convocation of this Institute is usually conducted on the birth anniversary of Sir Visvesvaraya , which is also celebrated as Engineers’ Day in India , to pay tribute to this visionary leader . 
The convocation today marks the completion of a vital phase in your life . 
You all have worked hard to acquire knowledge , technology and skills through the programme of the Institute . 
While achieving this , you might have undergone pressures , ups and downs and anxious moments . 
On this significant day in your life , you would be experiencing a certain joy and happiness to see your perseverance , hard work and commitment being translated into achievement of your goals and objectives . 
I am happy that all of you will now enter the professional field to become part of an active and skilled work force and will also add to the technical prowess of our nation . 
Education in general , and technical education in particular , has always been seen as an instrument of transformation for economic , social and political development of the country . 
We have always emphasized the role of science and technology in solving the problems of society . 
I am reminded of what Dr . Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had said in 1966 in his Message to the Nation on the occasion of Independence Day , and I quote , " Science and technology will help us to solve the problems of hunger and poverty , of disease and illiteracy , of superstition and deadening custom , of vast resources running to waste of a rich country inhabited by a poor people . ”
We have to effectively utilize the power of education , the strength of science and technology in the right direction to bring positive transformation in society . 
You , as graduates of this Institute , have the responsibility for ushering in societal transformation using the knowledge of science and technology which you have acquired . 
In today’s world , technology is disruptive . It brings in fast paced changes making it difficult , many a times , to keep pace with the evolving technological environment . 
The pace of change in technology makes the continuous learning process even more challenging . 
Today , after passing out from the hallowed portals of this Institute , I would urge all of you to continuously keep updating your knowledge and skills to deliver substantive outcomes for your organization , society and country . 
I am sure the faculty members of this Institute have empowered you to overcome myriad challenges and become successful leaders in whatever field of work you may decide to work in . 
Technologists are professional practitioners of engineering with special emphasis on applying scientific knowledge , mathematics and ingenuity to develop solutions for technological problems . 
Technologists integrate their knowledge of the physical sciences with more abstract realms beyond the boundaries of current technology in all areas of life . 
They have many different types of jobs to choose from , including research , design , analysis , development , testing , and sales positions . 
Technologists are problem solvers who search for quicker , better and less expensive ways to meet tough challenges . 
Thus , technology graduates like you will play a pivotal role in understanding and furthering the relationship between science , technology and society for a better tomorrow . 
On this momentous day when you set out on your journey into the real world , I call upon each one of you to take a pledge to make the full use of technology for the benefit of mankind and to see that the use of technology spreads happiness , prosperity and general well - being amongst the people of this country . 
The government has initiated the " Start - up India , Stand up India " campaign to promote financing for start - ups and offer incentives to boost entrepreneurship and job creation . 
The success of this initiative will depend on how innovatively we can use the technology as well as human resources available in our country . 
I call upon you , the young technologists , that instead of looking for job opportunities , you may aim to become entrepreneurs , who create job opportunities for people . 
Through your start - ups and entrepreneurships you can create enterprises , which will create wealth for the nation , society and people . 
This will be your biggest contribution to inclusive and sustainable development of our country . 
For the past three years , almost like a parrot , I have been repeating at the Conferences in Rashtrapati Bhavan and at Convocations that no single Indian institution is in the list of top 200 institutions of the world . 
As a result of several pro - active steps taken in the last three years , the ranking scene is beginning to change . 
It is a proud moment for Indian academic community and the institutes of higher learning that in the QS World University Rankings of 2015 - 16 released today , we havetwoIndian institutes in top 200 of the world . 
Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore is ranked at no . 147 and Indian Institute of Technology , Delhi is ranked at no . 179 . 
Apart from this , IIT - Bombay is ranked at no . 202 . 
Indian institutions have done remarkably well and I will like to take this opportunity to congratulate the faculty members and staff of these institutions . 
I will also like to appreciate these institutions for responding to my repeated calls to take the ranking process seriously and to present the credentials of our institutions by providing data at the appropriate time . 
A high rank can boost the morale of the academic community and open greater avenues of growth and placement for students . 
It can help attract the best faculty from India and abroad and provide a benchmark for continuous quality enhancement . 
I was reading a report that IITs rank at 61st position globally , when rated as a system . 
Similarly , the IITs as a unit together , are among the world’s top entrepreneurial under graduate universities at no . 4 , after Stanford , UC Berkeley and MIT . 
I am sharing this information to highlight the entrepreneurial capacity of our institutions and their potential to transform India through innovation and indigenization . 
The NITs , as institutes of national importance , have to take a lead in creating the capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship and align it with the national development goals . 
I would like to call upon your institute to take a lead in this direction . 
Knowledge and innovation are the keystones of progress . Competitive advantage can be derived from an eco - system conducive to new learning , research and innovation . 
I am sure that VNIT , Nagpur which is following the footprints of the technology visionary , Sir M . Visvesvaraya , will take a lead in creating an eco - system for entrepreneurship and innovation amongst the NITs . 
On this 13th Convocation of VNIT , 1117 students have received their degrees . 
I congratulate all the students who have become graduates today . 
You are a valuable asset to your profession and to the intellectual wealth of our nation . 
India is a country full of opportunities as well as challenges . 
I would like to conclude by quoting Mahatma Gandhi who had said , " Be the change that you wish to see in this world . ”
I once again wish all of you the very best in your chosen fields of activity . 
I am sure you will make all of us proud of your achievements in the years to come . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE TO ‘SWACHH BHARAT AMBASSADORS’
I congratulate the Urban Development Ministry for having brought together all the ambassadors who are dedicated to the cause of Swachh Bharat . 
It is heartening to see such an overwhelming response for the event and your strong presence here today assures me of its success . 
Before India achieved its independence , Mahatma Gandhi once said ‘Sanitation is more important than political freedom’ . 
However , even after 68 years of independence , statistics on sanitation speak otherwise and even today , 12 % of urban Indian households do not have access to sanitation facilities . 
This needs remedial action by all stakeholders of the society . In the Joint Session of the Parliament on 9thJune 2014 , I observed and I quote : 
We must not tolerate the indignity of homes without toilets and public spaces littered with garbage . 
For ensuring hygiene , waste management and sanitation across the nation a " Swachh Bharat Mission” will be launched . 
This will be our tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary to be celebrated in the year 2019 . 
On 2ndOctober 2014 , our nation took a pledge to make our country Open Defecation Free and Clean by the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi . 
We all are here today because we know that we can achieve this objective together and rid the shame that comes with open defecation . The time for action is here . 
Over the past one year , significant strides have been made . 
However much more needs to be done . 
In addition to building affordable and sustainable swachh Infrastructure , the mission’s success is equally , if not more , dependent oneach individual’s action . 
Hence , our strategy is to engage the country’s icons asSwachh Bharat Ambassadorsto make it a ‘Jan Andolan’ . 
We have to carry forward the momentum that has been built . 
Swachh Bharat Ambassadors have a huge potential to influence public to adopt safe sanitation practices and integrate them into their daily lives . 
An Ambassador does not only encourage his / her followers to imbibe the spirit of a Clean India but also motivate them to become Swachh Bharat Ambassadors themselves , making this mission a true form of ‘Jan Andolan’
The role of Ambassadors is not only to create awareness and motivate citizens , but also to join hands on - ground and participate in mission activities . 
You can devote a few hours of your precious time to contribute towards community mobilization , awareness creation , promotion of Swachh practices through multiple platforms , and other philanthropic activities including community adoption . 
It is necessary that you are engaged not only once but continuously , because the task at hand calls for sustained effort . 
Until each street is clean , each citizen has access to safe sanitation and every student lives in a hygienic environment , our task remains incomplete . 
I must once again congratulate Shri Venkaiah Naidu , Minister of Urban Development for taking this initiative to involve distinguished public figures as Swachh Bharat Mission’s Brand Ambassadors . 
I also compliment him and the entire team of Urban Development Ministry for bringing out a Coffee Table Book on Swachh Bharat Mission . 
I am pleased to see the firm commitment to the mission and look forward to the involvement of all citizens of India in this essential task . 
I am confident that through a " clean India” we will pay a fitting tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary . Let us become the nation that he dreamed of . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF CONFERMENT OF THE GANDHI PEACE PRIZE 2014 TO ISRO
I am delighted to be amongst you today . It is indeed appropriate that the Gandhi Peace Prize for 2014 is being conferred on the Indian Space Research Organization ( ISRO ) in recognition of its services in transforming India through the use of space technology and space based services . 
The Government of India instituted the Gandhi Peace Prize in 1995 on the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi as a tribute to his ideals . 
The Gandhi Peace Prize is awarded to individuals and institutions for their contributions towards social , economic and political transformation achieved through non - violence and other Gandhian methods . 
. ISRO today joins the ranks of other eminent institutions such as the Rama Krishna Mission , the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh and the Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan who have been conferred this prestigious award in recent times . 
ISRO has come a long way since its inception in 1969 . 
The relevance of space research was questioned by many at that time . 
In the words of the late Dr A P J Abdul Kalam , " Many individuals with myopic vision questioned the relevance of space activities in a newly independent nation , which was finding it difficult to feed its population . 
Their vision was clear if Indians were to play meaningful role in the community of nations , they must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to their real - life problems” . 
India’s entry into the space arena was led by the visionary scientist , Dr . Vikram Sarabhai who foresaw the tremendous potential of space technology and its applications in addressing the needs of our country’s development . 
Countering the challenges of scarce resources , limited technical manpower and physical infrastructure in the early years , ISRO has today established operational space systems and services , attained self - reliance in development of indigenous technology and accomplished exemplary feats in space exploration . 
It has , at the same time , remained true to its mission of bringing space to the service of the common man . 
From a humble beginning , launching small sounding rockets from Thumba for atmospheric studies , ISRO is today one of the six largest space agencies of the world . 
It has built an indigenous Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle ( PSLV ) which is one of the most sought after launch vehicles in its class across the world . 
It has achieved 29 successful flights of the PSLV launching not only Indian satellites but also 45 satellites of 19 other countries . 
The recent launch of five satellites of the United Kingdom marked a new milestone in demonstrating the performance and reliability of the PSLV . 
ISRO has also successfully built the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle ( GSLV ) with an indigenous cryogenic engine . 
Scripting space history on September 24 , 2014 India successfully placed the Mars Orbiter around Mars . 
It is the only country in the world to achieve this feat in its first attempt and the fourth space agency in the world to reach Mars . 
It makes us even more proud that this mission was achieved at a fraction of the cost incurred by other successful nations . 
In 2008 , the Indian tricolour was planted on the lunar surface by ‘Chandrayaan - 1’ on its maiden mission to the Moon , a mission which also led to the discovery of water in the lunar atmosphere . 
ISRO has similarly deployed a Space Based Augmentation System " GAGAN” for use by the aviation sector for precise position information services , safety - of - life applications and better air traffic management over Indian airspace . 
India is the fourth country in the world after USA , Japan and the European Union to offer such services . 
India has today , through ISRO , established a well - knit endogenous space infrastructure with adequate ground systems and in - situ observation networks to support a multitude of applications . 
These applications address social , economic and cultural aspects of Indian society and provide inputs for informed decision - making at various levels . 
ISRO’s people centric space programmes are designed to support various national priorities such as food & water security , sustainable environmental practices , conservation of resources , livelihood support , poverty alleviation , rural prosperity , education and health care and disaster management amongst others . 
Permit me to expand on a few initiatives of ISRO which have led to significant societal transformation in India , embodying a practical realization of Gandhian goals . 
Rural Education and Health
ISRO’s Satellite Instructional Television Experiment ( SITE ) launched in 1975 was a pioneer in making available informational television programmes to rural India with the objective of educating the rural populace on various issues related to agricultural practices , occupational skills , general health and hygiene , family planning etc . 
The SITE transmissions had a significant impact on Indian villages and paved the path for use of advanced satellite broadcasting technology to fulfil the socio - economic needs of the country . 
Our satellite based networks are today playing a key role in taking education , health care and rural connectivity to the remotest parts of our country . 
Disaster Management
India , on account of widely varying geo - climatic conditions , has always been vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods , earthquakes and cyclones . 
ISRO’s Earth Observation , Meteorological and Communication satellites are a core component of the disaster management scenario of the country . 
Meteorological satellites are used extensively to monitor weather events and forecast weather , including the genesis of cyclones , their track and landfall prediction . 
This helps minimize damage to life and property . 
The value added products generated using satellite imagery help address information needs of all phases of disaster management such as preparedness , early warning , response , relief , rehabilitation , recovery and mitigation . 
Improving the livelihood of fishermen
Millions of people living along the 7500 km long coastline in India are dependent on fishing for their livelihood . 
As fish stocks dwindle and move further offshore , search time , cost and effort increase for fishermen . 
Satellite based fishing zone advisories are made available in local languages on a daily basis to the fishing community resulting in enhanced fish catches , reduced search times and resultant savings in fuel costs , thereby improving the well - being and quality of life of our fishermen . 
Conservation of resources
Speaking about the conservation of natural resources and protection of our environment , Mahatma Gandhi had said and I quote , The earth , the air , the land and the water are not an inheritance from our fore fathers but on loan from our children . 
So we have to handover to them at least as it was handed over to us . 
Space applications have been suitably adapted to respond to the needs of integrated watershed development in the country , conservation of soil and water resources , and protection of the environment . 
They have helped draw up developmental plans for enhancing agricultural production in rain - fed areas leading to rural prosperity . 
Developmental plans drawn up at micro - watershed level using remote sensing images have resulted in increase in cropping intensity and crop yield , decrease in fallow lands , reclamation of wastelands , increase in irrigated crops and livelihood improvements . 
Empowerment of Panchayats
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated democratic decentralization and Panchayati Raj where each village was responsible for its own affairs . 
ISRO’s programme of ‘Space Based Information Support for Decentralized Planning’ is inspired by Gandhiji’s vision of ‘Gram Swaraj’ or village self - governance . 
Under this programme , state - wise thematic databases on natural resources are being generated for the entire country . 
These spatial databases integrated with field level information and traditional wisdom help in preparation of locale - specific action plans for land and water management with people’s participation . 
Preservation of Heritage Sites
A database of heritage sites and Site Management Plans drawn up using space technology helps policy planners take informed decisions regarding conservation and preservation and also enables monitoring of activities onsite . 
A pilot study has been carried out for the Hampi world heritage site . 
Space based technology tools are also being planned for mapping and identifying the vulnerability of each monument and for preparing plans to track and mitigate environmental or weather changes that may have an adverse impact on fragile monuments . 
Indigenization
Self - reliance and development of indigenous technology is a key policy of ISRO and its success in this endeavour can be seen in the areas of launch vehicles , satellites , communication , meteorology , space science and establishing of the required ground infrastructure . 
Science and Technology is a key driver for shaping the destiny of nations and people across the globe . 
Technology is built not so much by individuals but by organizations . 
The characteristics of organizations – their leaders , their structures and their cultures have a great bearing on catalysing innovations and putting them to use for the benefit of society . 
ISRO is one such Indian organisation , which has nurtured , developed and demonstrated world class capabilities . 
Even as it has sought to encompass the globe and reach for the stars , it has remained rooted in its core mission of national regeneration and improving the life of the common man , a goal set for the nation by Mahatma Gandhi . 
I salute the ISRO Team for its committed , tireless and sustained service to the nation . 
I congratulate each and every member of the Indian Space community on ISRO being awarded the coveted Gandhi Peace Prize . 
I am confident that ISRO will continue to scale greater heights and bring glory to India in the years to come . 
Thank you , Jai Hind . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF NATIONAL AWARDS TO MERITORIOUS TEACHERS ON THE OCCASION OF TEACHER’S DAY
It is indeed a pleasure for me to be present here and address you all on Teachers’ Day . 
I am happy to join you on this occasion where we recognise the dedicated services of many teachers throughout the country who are actively engaged in building and strengthening the intellectual and ethical foundations of our children . 
It is a day when we honour , with the national awards those of you who have made significant contribution for improvement of school education . 
I congratulate you for this national recognition . I also greet all teachers of our country and express our gratitude for their service and commitment . 
In our country , 5th of September is celebrated as the Teachers’ Day . 
It is the birth anniversary of my pre - eminent predecessor , Dr . Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , who was one of the great scholars and philosophers and above all a great teacher of our country . 
He was a mentor and a revered guide to educationists who understood the educational priorities of modern India . 
Long back , he had said and I quote " The aim of education is not the acquisition of information , although important , or acquisition of technical skills , though essential in modern society , but the development of that bent of mind , that attitude of reason , that spirit of democracy which will make us responsible citizens . ”
These words remind us even today of the need for introspection with a basic question : 
What educational experiences are we providing to our children to achieve this aim ? 
In the fast changing world of today where new ideas , values and concepts are rapidly replacing the old ones , the importance of quality of education for any student has further increased . 
The education has to liberate a person from narrow world view and the boundaries of caste , community , race and gender . 
Teachers have been entrusted with the responsibility of moulding the young minds to understand the world and make it better . 
To achieve this , teachers working in the schools , colleges and universities need to define to themselves what it is to be a teacher and what effort can make their performance meaningful to achieve this aim . 
This is a high time for introspection . 
I believe that more than ever , today we need inspired teachers to instil in our children the civilizational values of sacrifice , tolerance , plurality , understanding and compassion . 
I would define an inspired teacher as a value - oriented , mission - driven , self - motivated and result - oriented individual . He works towards impacting the environment in a positive manner through his own actions as well as by imparting knowledge amongst students to help them achieve their potential . 
An inspired teacher links the individual goals of the students to the societal and national goals . Such teachers appeal not only to the head but also the heart . 
Through words , actions and deeds , they inspire the students and elevate them to a higher level of performance and thinking . 
Responsibility of producing aware , conscious and intellectual citizens who build the future of our nation lies with the teachers . 
There was a time when we had renowned seats of learning like Takshashila , Nalanda , Vikramashila , Valabi , Somapura and Odantpuri . 
They attracted scholars from far and wide . 
The powerful minds who taught at such universities created an exalted position for our ancient education system . 
We have to regain our leadership position . 
We look towards teachers to guide the way . 
We must ensure that our education system attracts talent to the academic profession . 
Our teachers need to get themselves a new orientation and evolve new methodologies to create relevant and effective approaches to teaching and learning . 
They also need to continuously renew their capabilities through research , experimentation and innovation to achieve excellence . 
Information and Communication Technology ( ICT ) is another area where teachers have to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies . 
It is essential for teachers to be comfortable in using ICT themselves first . 
With the advancement in communication technology leading to increased flow of information , the teachers need to be guide the students not only to benefit from the freely available information but also not to get overwhelmed by the incessant flow of information . 
The improved communication technology has and to ensure that the students get full benefit of ICT including children with special needs . 
We must work for the long term goal of creating institutional facilities for innovative training and professional development of teachers . 
I am sure that Government of India’s Scheme of Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya National Mission for Teachers and Teaching ( PMMMNMTT ) will address all these urgent priorities and the related issues in a holistic manner . 
Education empowers and enables a nation . A sound education system is the bedrock of an enlightened society . 
To build India of our dreams , the foremost task before us is to improve the quality of education infusing modern technologies and addressing the concerns of equality . 
Friends , it is ingrained in us to believe that while our parents give us life , it is our " gurus” that shape our character and aspirations . 
You are the gurus ; and you have the responsibility of creating leaders of the future . 
In present times , emphasis on values such as hard work , integrity , truthfulness , scientific temper , sensitivity towards our environment and honesty is very essential . 
My dear teachers , it is you who can inculcate such important values , practising these by yourselves , in your students to make them virtuous citizens . 
I take this opportunity to recognise , with deep appreciation , the professional dedication with which you all have played a commendable role in making our nation a confident , vibrant and modern India . 
I congratulate all the teachers who are being recognised with awards . To all of you , I wish success for your future endeavours . 
I also convey my best wishes to the entire teaching community in the country and call upon them to stay firm on the path of leading India forward to its next golden age . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE DIAMOND JUBILEE CELEBRATIONS OF ENGINEERING EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL OF INDIA
I am delighted to be here today on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of EEPC India , a premier trade and investment promotion organization of our country . 
Set up in 1955 by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry , EEPC India has been successfully shouldering its responsibility of nurturing Indian engineering exports for the last 60 years . 
The organization started its journey as the Engineering Export Promotion Council with only 40 exporters at a time when India’s engineering exports were all of 10 million US dollars . 
It has today become the largest organization of its kind with over 13 , 000 members out of whom 60 % are SMEs . 
Engineering exports from India have , in the meantime , crossed US $ 70 billion in the last fiscal which is a testimony to the service that EEPC has been rendering to the nation . 
The challenges before EEPC are immense . 
Engineering is the leading segment of Indian industry and overseas shipments from this sector account for over twenty - two percent of India’s total merchandise exports . 
The engineering sector accounts for 25 percent of India’s total factories in the organized sector and contributes around 35 percent of total output in the country , being the highest foreign exchange earner . 
The importance of engineering in India’s merchandise exports has risen over time . 
While India’s total merchandise exports expanded by 2 . 71 times during the last decade ending 2014 - 15 , engineering exports saw an increase of 3 . 65 times during the corresponding time period . 
The share of engineering exports to total merchandise exports rose from 18 . 14 % in fiscal 2004 - 05 to 22 . 71 % in 2014 - 15 . 
North America and Europe accounted for over 31 % of India’s engineering exports while Africa and the ASEAN region each accounted for approximately 12 % of India’s overseas shipments of engineering goods . 
In terms of products , iron & steel products had the highest share in engineering exports at 23 % , followed by ‘Auto and Auto Components’ and ‘Industrial Machinery’ with a share of 18 . 2 % and 16 . 2 % respectively during the last fiscal . 
A key driver behind the rise in our engineering exports has been the shifting of global manufacturing bases to countries such as India that offer relatively low - cost human resource coupled with high quality engineering aptitude . 
The nature of Indian engineering exports has been changing over time as India is fast moving from exporting low - value goods to developing countries to exporting high - value goods to developed countries . 
Fresh opportunities such as outsourcing of engineering goods and services , better and improved product design , product differentiation , and maintenance and designing of manufacturing systems are providing new growth avenues in this sector . 
The prospects for the Indian engineering sector appear bright . In the aftermath of the global recession , our economy has started showing signs of revival . 
GDP growth improved from 5 . 1 percent in 2012 - 13 to 6 . 9 percent in 2013 - 14 and then to 7 . 3 percent in the last fiscal . 
Industrial production , led by the manufacturing sector , also exhibited an upturn . 
In the wake of recent developments in the global financial markets , India with its moderating inflation rates , lower current account and fiscal deficits , strong foreign currency reserves , stable tax policies and an expected growth rate of 8 - 8 . 5 % in the current fiscal appears as one of the few bright spots in the global economy . 
In order to , however , consistently achieve high growth rates over the next two decades , India would require unprecedented investments in infrastructure , human and social capital . 
Infrastructure development for India is , thus , both an imperative and a key concern . 
The growth prospects for the engineering sector in the light of stepping up of investments in infrastructure and physical capital are , accordingly , immense . 
The manufacturing sector contributes 18 percent to India’s GDP . 
This sector , it is estimated , has the potential of creating 90 million domestic jobs by 2025 and of contributing 25 % to India’s GDP . 
The ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government aims to transform India into a global manufacturing hub . 
The objective of this policy is to attract investments from across the globe and get multi - nationals to produce their products in India by using India’s talented and low cost human resource base . 
Success of this initiative will facilitate further development and strengthening of the Indian engineering sector as a consequence . 
EEPC has till now worked closely with various Ministries and Departments , on the one hand , and with national and international trade and investment promotion bodies , on the other , to draw comprehensive and inclusive strategies for promoting India’s engineering exports . 
The thrust now will have to be on product quality , market and product diversification . 
It is a matter of satisfaction , therefore , that EEPC has taken many initiatives to promote new and emerging sectors such as Defense , Medical Devices and Renewable Energy and is stressing on Skill Development to ensure that the engineering sector is geared up for the future . 
I am happy to note that EEPC India organizes a large number of promotional activities such as buyer - seller meets ( BSM ) – both in India and abroad , overseas trade fairs / exhibitions , and India pavilion / information booths in selected overseas exhibitions to demonstrate the capabilities of the Indian engineering industry . 
The ‘India Engineering Exhibition’ ( INDEE ) which is EEPC India’s own brand is one of the largest engineering expositions in the world . 
To encourage building global partnerships with India , EEPC India also organizes the India Engineering Sourcing Show ( IESS ) , the largest display of engineering products and services every year . 
I am confident EEPC India will continue to enlarge the sphere of its activities in coordination with all stakeholders and build up a formidable brand value for the Indian engineering industry in the years to come . 
EEPC’s achievements have been many , but there is a long path which still remains to be traversed . 
I am sure EEPC will rise to the occasion and continue to partner the nation in its march towards economic and social development . I once again thank all of you for inviting me to be a part of this memorable occasion . 
I wish you the very best in your future endeavors . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON MEETING CONTRIBUTORS TO THE BOOK “30 WOMEN IN POWER : THEIR VOICES , THEIR STORIES”
I am indeed happy to be here this evening to meet the distinguished achievers who have contributed to the book " 30 Women in Power : ”
I congratulate Naina Lal Kidwai , a banker par excellence , for taking the effort to anthologize the accomplishments of these extraordinary women . 
I also compliment all the eminent and empowered women leaders featured in this book who are pioneers in various fields of activities . 
The stories and experiences of their journey towards success will serve as an immense source of inspiration and motivation surely to all women . 
But , also I may add here to all persons , both men and women , as they are stories of challenges , conviction , commitment , dedication and indomitable courage without which nobody can achieve success . 
This book will also help sensitize men to the problems women are confronted with every day and make them realize that respect for women must inform every decision they make . 
The book is important not only because it is a celebration of women empowerment , but also because it a timely reminder of the battles that still need to be fought , and those that are being fought each day , by women to find their place under the Sun . 
The book is about the inner strength of women and how far their determination and faith can take them . 
We as a nation must respect as sacred , the rights of women to equal opportunities and dignified living . 
The first steps in this direction , in theory , have already been taken in our Constitution that envisions equality for all . 
But , as I mentioned it will have to be practiced in many areas such as through women - centric legislation and by fully implementing the seventy - third and seventy - fourth amendments and also not just by the ratification of international conventions ( including the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ) but by implementing them in letter and spirit . 
A lot still remains to be done especially in the direction of translating laws to reality . 
More girls need to be imparted education ; more women need to be encouraged to get economically empowered and more institutions need to support the aspirations of women . 
If given a window of opportunity , women who are natural multi - taskers have the potential to rise and excel in any field of their choice . 
We need to build such mechanisms within institutions that facilitate the growth of women into decision making positions . 
One aspect that worries me immensely is the growing violence against women . 
The society which cannot respect women simply cannot be called a civilised society . 
In the Vedic civilization , women were always given the highest level of respect and freedom and at the same time , their protection and safety was a sacred duty of society as a whole . 
This is our culture , this is our heritage . 
We cannot allow ourselves to forget this . 
It is our collective responsibility to create an ecosystem that ensures safety , security and dignity of women in the society . 
Before I conclude , I once again extend my felicitations to all those associated with the bringing out of the book and wish their efforts all success . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE BANQUET HOSTED IN HONOUR OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SEYCHELLES , HIS EXCELLENCY , MR . JAMES ALIX MICHEL
It gives me great pleasure to welcome Your Excellency this evening . 
Your State Visit , following the landmark visit of India’s Prime Minister to Seychelles earlier this year , is a reiteration of the high importance that our Governments attach to strengthening our strategic partnership . 
The close bonds of friendship between India and Seychelles have stood the test of time . 
For the past four decades , since the independence of Seychelles , we have worked together to achieve our common goals of development and growth . 
We have joined hands to face common challenges , addressed regional and global issues , overcome adversities and celebrated our successes . 
The participation of an Indian Navy contingent in your National Day Parade this year was not only an honour to India but also a manifestation of our shared sentiments . 
Mr . President , we laud your vision for Seychelles and your efforts to revitalize its growth and development . 
The economic reforms undertaken by you , the expansion and diversification of your economy and your simultaneous focus on social welfare have shown splendid results . 
Seychelles now stands among the countries recognised by the World Bank as High Income Group Countries . 
We welcome your accession to the World Trade Organisation and congratulate you on your being ranked by the UNDP as the country with the 3rdhighest Human Development Index in Africa in the year 2014 . 
Your efforts for the development of the concept of " Blue Economy for Sustainable Development” and your commitment to the issues of the Small Island Developing States find resonance and support in India . 
With our long coastline , numerous small islands and significant reliance on the oceanic climate system , we , in India , face similar challenges . 
I am confident that the agreements that our Governments have signed and new areas of co - operation that we have identified during your visit will further strengthen our partnership – which already is an example of mutually beneficial , South - South Cooperation . 
Our Protocol on co - operation in the field of Blue Economy is a major step in the conservation and sustainable use of Indian Ocean resources . 
We are glad that our maritime security co - operation has been fruitful . 
The operationalisation of the Coastal Surveillance and Radar System will further contribute to securing your maritime territory . 
The increased air connectivity between Mahe and Mumbai will promote tourist flows in both directions and help to intensify business contacts and enhance bilateral trade and investment . 
India is committed to extending our support and assistance to Seychelles in areas prioritised by your Government . 
Excellency , our traditional linkages and cultural affinities are at the core of our strategic convergence at multilateral fora . 
We greatly appreciate the support that we have received from you for our candidature for permanent membership of an expanded UN Security Council . 
In this 70th year of the United Nations , UNSC reform and expansion will be discussed at the UNGA – for which an intergovernmental negotiating text has been introduced . 
We look forward to working with you for a constructive outcome . 
I take this opportunity to reiterate that India remains deeply committed to its partnership with Africa . 
This is exemplified by the India - Africa Forum Summits which began in 2008 . India will be hosting the 3rd Summit of the Forum in October this year . 
We expect the Summit to result in new ideas for enhancing the socio - economic development of our peoples . We look forward to your participation in the Summit . 
With these words , Mr . President , I once again welcome you and the distinguished members of your delegation and wish you a very productive and enjoyable visit . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , may I request you to join me in raising a toast to : 
- the health and well - being of His Excellency , President James Alix Michel ; 
- the continued progress and prosperity of the Republic of Seychelles ; and
- the enduring friendship between the people of India and the friendly people of Seychelles . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF CALL ON BY HEADS OF STATE / GOVERNMENT PARTICIPATING IN 2ND SUMMIT OF FORUM FOR INDIA - PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES ( FIPIC ) 
I warmly welcome you all to India . It is indeed a pleasure and a privilege to receive you in the Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
Even though India is separated from the Pacific Island Countries by oceans and continents , we are proud to have a long tradition of close friendship with you . 
Our peoples are bound by our centuries - old trade and cultural linkages that have contributed to the trust and warmth in our relations . 
We particularly appreciate the way that your nations have made the Indian diaspora feel comfortable and secure in distant lands . 
Our Government attaches great importance to its relations with our friends in the Pacific Island Countries . 
We believe our economic linkages and co - operation with your countries are a key factor in India’s extended " Act East” Policy . 
India is delighted to host the 2nd Summit of the Forum for India - Pacific Islands Co - operation . 
The establishment of this Forum reflects the desire of all its member countries to build an enduring partnership between our nations and our peoples . 
I would like to thank you for the contribution of each of your governments to its success . 
Your reunion in New Delhi and Jaipur , less than a year after the first Summit in Fiji last November , is testimony to your commitment to the common objectives of the Forum . 
I am happy to note that the programs announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the First FIPIC Summit in Fiji only a few months ago are already bearing fruit . 
We propose to enhance our engagement in the sectors where our interests converge – such as human resource development , capacity building , healthcare , affordable , clean and renewable energy , adaptation measures for disaster management and infrastructure development . 
India is committed to partner with you in your efforts to achieve the developmental goals of your respective nations . 
Towards this end , India’s annual grant - in - aid to each Pacific Island Country has been enhanced from US $ 125 , 000 to US $ 200 , 000 last year . 
We hope this will support specific projects prioritised by you . 
We are glad that the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation programme , the ICCR scholarships , the special training modules organized by Foreign Service Institute and other such schemes are being availed by your citizens . 
We believe that such exchanges between our peoples will go a long way in increasing their contacts and mutual understanding . 
I am convinced that our bilateral cooperation has much greater potential waiting to be realised . 
India has made considerable progress in the field of IT , health , solar energy , disaster mitigation and management , agriculture – particularly coconut and coir and oil and natural gas exploration . 
We are focused on skills development and innovation - with special emphasis on locally relevant technology . 
It is our earnest desire to share our knowledge and expertise with friendly countries like yours - especially where these can be adopted to promote sustainable development . 
Excellencies , India , like the Pacific Island Countries , has chains of islands and is also experiencing the negative impact of climate change . 
Like you , we are confronted with serious challenges in preserving our fragile ecosystems while stimulating growth . 
We believe that the sharing of best practices and eco - friendly technologies among our countries will greatly help us all to collaborate in obtaining finances and technology transfers required to combat the impact of climate change . 
India has launched a number of domestic measures including carbon pricing , incentivizing afforestation , expanding the use of low carbon and renewable technologies and improving energy efficiency in all sectors . 
We would be happy to work with you in these areas - to help preserve your environment and conserve your precious resources . 
The Pacific Island Countries are generously endowed with natural resources . 
We would be happy to work with you in harnessing your mineral , marine and hydrocarbon resources . 
Our Government and private sector are keen to strengthen and diversify our bilateral trade and encourage investments in fisheries , agriculture , oil and natural gas , mining and water desalination . 
It would be in the interest of all FIPIC members to identify our complementarities so that we can focus our efforts on those . 
Excellencies , we greatly appreciate the support we have received from you for our candidature for permanent membership of an expanded UN Security Council . 
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the United Nations . UNSC reform and expansion will be discussed and concrete proposals are expected to be considered in the forthcoming UNGA session next month . 
An intergovernmental negotiating text is already on the table , for which we need your support . 
Our nations share a common commitment to the reform of institutions of global governance – so that they better reflect the aspirations of developing countries . 
We believe that it is vital for us to work together to push for these long awaited reforms in the forthcoming session of the UNGA . 
I am confident that your deliberations tomorrow and the work of the Forum will result in concrete proposals for our enhanced cooperation in the years ahead . 
I look forward to increased exchanges between our Governments and our peoples on regional and global issues of our common concern . 
On a personal note , I am delighted that some of you are accompanied by your gracious spouses . 
I hope you all enjoy your visit and that the programmes of the Forum bring you to India regularly . 
With these few words , Excellencies , I once again welcome you and extend to you my best wishes for the success of the 2ndFIPIC Summit . 
PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS TO THE NATION ON THE EVE OF INDIA’S 69TH INDEPENDENCE DAY
On the eve of 68th anniversary of our Independence I extend warm greetings to you and to all Indians around the world . 
I convey my special greetings to members of our armed forces , paramilitary forces and internal security forces . 
I also congratulate all our sportspersons who have participated and won laurels in various tournaments in India and abroad . 
My congratulations to Shri Kailash Satyarthi , Nobel Peace Prize winner for 2014 , who has done the country proud . 
On 15th August 1947 , we won political freedom . 
The birth of modern India was a moment of historic exhilaration ; but it was also tinged with the blood of unimaginable suffering along the length and breadth of our country . 
The ideals and convictions , that had held through the travails of an epic struggle against British rule , were under strain . 
A great generation of supreme heroes faced this formidable challenge . 
The sagacity and maturity of that generation saved our ideals from deviation or degeneration under the pressure of emotion , including rage . 
India’s pride , self - esteem and self - respect , born from a civilizational wisdom which inspired the renaissance that won us freedom , was distilled into the principles of our constitution by these extraordinary men and women . 
We have been blessed by a constitution that launched India’s march towards greatness . 
The most precious gift of this document was democracy , which reshaped our ancient values into a modern context and institutionalized multiple freedoms . 
It turned liberty into a living opportunity for the oppressed and impoverished , offered equality and positive discrimination to the many millions , who had suffered social injustice , and instituted a gender revolution that has made our country an example of progress . 
We abolished archaic customs and laws , and ensured change for women through education and jobs . 
Our institutions are the infrastructure of this idealism . 
The finest inheritance needs constant care for preservation . 
Our institutions of democracy are under stress . 
The Parliament has been converted into an arena of combat rather than debate . 
It is time to recall what Dr . B . R . Ambedkar , Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution , said while making his closing speech in the Constituent Assembly in November 1949 and I quote : 
The working of a constitution does not depend wholly upon the nature of the constitution . 
The constitution can provide only the organs of state , such as the legislature , the executive and the judiciary . 
The factors on which the working of those organs of the state depends are the people and the political parties they will set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their politics . 
Who can say how the people of India and their parties will behave ? 
If the institutions of democracy are under pressure , it is time for serious thinking by the people and their parties . 
Our country ' s rise will be measured by the strength of our values , but it will equally be determined by economic growth and equitable distribution of the nation ' s resources . 
Our economy promises much hope for the future . 
The new chapters of the ‘India Story’ are waiting to be written . ‘Economic reforms’ is a work - in - progress . 
Our performance over the last decade has been commendable ; and it is most heartening that after a dip , we have recovered to 7 . 3 % growth in 2014 - 15 . 
But the benefits of growth must reach the poorest of the poor much before they land in the bank accounts of the richest of the rich . 
We are an inclusive democracy , and an inclusive economy ; there is place for everyone in the hierarchy of wealth . But the first call goes to those who suffer on the brink of deprivation . 
Our policies must be geared to meet the ‘Zero Hunger’ challenge in a foreseeable future . 
The symbiotic relationship between man and nature has to be preserved . 
A generous nature when violated can turn into a destructive force leading to calamities resulting in huge loss of life and property . 
Even as I speak , large parts of the nation are barely recovering from floods . 
We need immediate relief for the afflicted as well as long - term solutions for the management of both , water deficiency and excess . 
A nation which forgets the idealism of its past loses something vital from its future . 
Our educational institutions multiply as the aspirations of generations continue to exceed supply . 
But what has happened to quality , from base to apex ? 
We recall theguru - shishya parampara with legitimate pride ; why then have we abandoned the care , devotion and commitment that is at the heart of this relationship ? 
Agurumuch like the soft and skilful hands of a potter , moulds the destiny ofshishya . 
The student with devotion and humility acknowledges the debt of the teacher . 
Society respects and recognizes the merit and scholarship of the teacher . 
Is that happening in our education system today ? Students , teachers and authorities must pause and introspect . 
Our democracy is creative because it is plural , but diversity must be nourished with tolerance and patience . 
Vested interests chip away at social harmony , in an attempt to erode many centuries of secularism . 
In an age of instant communication through ever - improving technology , we must remain vigilant to ensure that the devious designs of a few never overcome the essential oneness of our people . 
For both government and people the rule of law is sacrosanct , but society is also protected by something greater than law : humanity . 
Mahatma Gandhi said and I quote : You must not lose faith in humanity . 
Humanity is an ocean ; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty , the ocean does not become dirty . 
Peace , friendship and cooperation bind nations and peoples together . 
Recognizing the shared destiny of the Indian sub - continent , we must strengthen connectivity , expand institutional capacity and enhance mutual trust to further regional cooperation . 
As we make progress in advancing our interests globally , India is also engaged in pro - actively promoting goodwill and prosperity in our immediate neighbourhood . 
It is heartening that the long pending land boundary issue with Bangladesh has been finally resolved . 
While we offer our hand willingly in friendship , we cannot stay blind to deliberate acts of provocation and a deteriorating security environment . 
India is a target of vicious terrorist groups operating from across the borders . 
Except the language of violence and the cult of evil , these terrorists have no religion and adhere to no ideology . 
Our neighbours must ensure that their territoryis not used by forces inimical to India . 
Our policy will remain one of zero tolerance for terrorism . 
We reject any attempt to use terrorism as an instrument of state policy . 
Infiltration into our territory and attempts to create mayhem will be dealt with a strong hand . 
I pay homage to the martyrs who made the supreme sacrifice of their lives defending India . 
I salute the courage and heroism of our security forces who are maintaining an eternal vigil to safeguard the territorial integrity of our country and the safety of our people . 
I also specially commend the brave civilians who boldly detained a hardened terrorist ignoring the risk to their own lives . 
India is a complex country of 1 . 3 billion people , 122 languages , 1600 dialects and 7 religions . 
Its strength lies in its unique capacity to blend apparent contradictions into positive affirmations . 
In the words of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , it is a country held together and I quote : " by strong but invisible threads… . . About her there is the elusive quality of a legend of long ago ; some enchantment seems to have held her mind . She is a myth and an idea , a dream and a vision , and yet very real and present and pervasive”
On the fertile ground laid by our Constitution , India has blossomed into a vibrant democracy . 
The roots are deep but the leaves are beginning to wilt . 
It is time for renewal . 
If we do not act now , will our successors seven decades hence remember us with the respect and admiration we have for those who shaped the Indian dream in 1947 . 
The answer may not be comfortable , but the question has to be asked . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF SARASWATI SAMMAAN FOR THE YEAR 2014 TO DR . M VEERAPPA MOILY
It is a great pleasure for me to be here this evening on the occasion of the presentation of the 24thSaraswati Sammaan . 
I am particularly happy to have the privilege of conferring this prestigious award on my fellow Parliamentarian and friend of mine for several decades , Dr . M . Veerappa Moily . 
I congratulate Dr . Moily for contributing to literature through his prolific writings along with having a successful political career . 
The two great epics of India , Valmiki’sRamayanaand Vyasa’sMahabharatahave had a major role in moulding thesamskarasand sentiments of most Indians . 
There is hardly any Indian , regardless of his religion , caste or creed , who is not familiar with these grand epics . 
IftheMahabharatainstilled in us the values of forbearance , generosity and familial virtues , the Ramayanagave us images of filial , conjugal , and fraternal love in a world that treasured the welfare of all human beings . 
It is a rare combination of political philosophy and spiritual discourse bringing high morality to practical situations of daily life . 
So also Moily ji has reflected upon virtually all facets of social and political life in India today . 
In his magnificent composition of 43 , 000 lines inspired by the original epic of Valmiki , Moilyji has shared with us his unique insight into contemporary situations . 
He has then addressed them through the prism of the eternal principles of good governance , high morality and righteousness . 
He has , no doubt , drawn from his own variety of experiences as a political leader and administrator . 
He has shared his belief that present day India has a lot to learn from the Ramayana – especially that our nation - building effort must be based on the strong foundation of tolerance , pluralism and inclusiveness . 
I laud Moilyji for selecting the effective medium of poetry and the timeless theme of the Ramayana to deliver this important message . 
I congratulate him for reminding us , through his powerful verse , that the challenges that our society faces today can be resolved if we follow our ancient value systems . 
I am reminded of Gandhiji’s dream of ‘Ram Rajya’ , in which he envisioned an ideal society - where justice , equality , idealism , renunciation and sacrifice are practised . His Ram Rajya is a nation where peace , prosperity and tranquillity prevail . 
Gandhiji had once said that the Ram Rajya of his dreams meant , and I quote , " sovereignty of the people based on pure moral authority” . Just as good prevails over evil in the Ramayana - and Gandhiji’s words " Satyamev Jayete” remind us that truth alone triumphs , Moilyji’s epic brings to us such ageless values as compassion , self correction and discipline in thought and deed . 
I find , in his message , an echo of my own perceptions – that our democracy can only flourish if there is an active Parliament , if the representatives of the people have a clear vision , if their efforts are supported and supplemented by a diligent Government and an independent judiciary . 
Additionally , the system depends on a responsible media and a vigilant society . 
Thus , our democratic rights come with responsibilities . 
We , the people of India are duty bound to make collective efforts to build our society , and contribute sincerely to the economic growth and inclusive development of our nation . 
Gandhiji stated once that it must be our endeavour to avoid the Seven Deadly Sins of " Politics without principles , wealth without work , pleasure without conscience , knowledge without character , commerce without morality , science without humanity and worship without sacrifice” . 
I have no doubt that through his magnificent work , Shri Ramayana Mahanveshanam , Moilyjiwill help create a greater sensitivity to such values . 
This composition can truly be called a milestone – not only in the realm of Indian literature ; but in the tradition of the Ramayana . 
I am very glad that the poem has been translated into Hindi , Telugu , Tamil and English and has thus become accessible to a larger readership . 
I take this opportunity to congratulate the K . K . Birla Foundation for instituting the Saraswati Sammaan and encouraging creative literature . 
I thank them for giving me this honour and wish the Foundation every success in its other similar initiatives . 
With these words , I once again congratulate my old friend Dr . Veerappa Moily . 
I thank you all . 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE TO HIGHER EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS ON THE TOPIC “ENERGIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES IN INDIA” THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCING
Leaders of institutions of higher education ; heads of other academic and research institutes ; faculty members ; dear students : 
I am happy to have the opportunity to interact with you at the beginning of this new academic session . 
I welcome all the new students to universities and other centres of higher learning . 
Addressing you twice a year through video conferencing is a practice I started in January 2014 . 
Through this e - platform , which now has been upgraded to twice its capacity , it is possible for me to connect with a much larger audience from Kashmir to Kanyakumari , West to East and North - East . 
For that , I must thank the National Knowledge Network and the NIC teams . 
I speak to you today in the shadow of an irreparable loss that we have suffered in the passing away of Dr . A . P . J . Abdul Kalam . 
My two illustrious predecessors , Dr . Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan - a philosopher teacher and Dr . APJ Abdul Kalam - a scientist teacher have greatly influenced my thinking on the education sector . 
When we talk of energizing the higher educational institutions , we should be guided by what Dr . Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had said , and I quote : 
Education should be imparted with a view to the type of society that we wish to build . 
We are working for a modern democracy built on the values of human dignity and equality . 
These are only ideals ; we should make them living forces . 
The enduring civilization that is India is also a land of contradictions . 
It is a matter of fact that 26 per cent of our population is illiterate . 
Yet , our education system has given rise to the second largest pool of scientists and engineers in the world . 
Even today , many villages in the country are devoid of clean drinking water . 
Yet , we churn out a larger quantity of software for US IT firms than any other country . 
To take this fascinating and vibrant democracy to greater heights , we need highly educated and skilled young men and women . 
That is the challenge before our higher education system . 
As Dr . Kalam has explained in his book , " Indomitable Spirit” , the education system in the 21stcentury must be based on five components - research and enquiry , creativity and innovation , capacity to use high end technology , entrepreneurship and moral leadership . 
In the contemporary world , we are wading in a sea of information . 
Converting this information into knowledge and knowledge into wisdom , calls for exceptional skills which we must impart in our students . 
They should be prepared for lifelong learning which now is easier because of digital technology . 
An inquisitive mind and research oriented approach has to be built in our students . 
It is easy to be overwhelmed by the amount of information around us . 
But when information is networked , its power and utility increases . 
In today’s world , management of knowledge is beyond the capacity of an individual . 
Students must learn how to manage knowledge collectively . 
Another skill essential for the younger generation is to learn how to use the latest technologies for aiding their learning process . 
Universities must create an eco - system with adequate hardware and software where ‘inspired teachers’ can be effectively used to propagate knowledge . 
Entrepreneurship is another quality which must be cultivated in our students from an early age . 
They must learn how to take calculated risks for the sake of greater achievements within the parameters of ethical business practices . 
Value oriented education with deep understanding of the democratic governance structures and systems are a must for building leadership skills . 
Development of the country and betterment of humanity should be the guiding principles for mission driven leaders of tomorrow . 
" Yes , We Can” , spirit also has to be inculcated in formative years of our gen - next . 
They must have the disposition " to do the right thing” as well as " to do things right” . 
Urgent measures to improve academic management in higher level institutions are necessary . 
To make learning more effective , teaching pedagogy must be refined , curricula up - dated regularly , an inter - disciplinary approach adopted and evaluation mechanism reformed . 
They must identify core competencies and nurture centres of excellence . 
The higher education sector is witnessing sweeping changes the world over . 
Rising costs of higher education and the changing profile of education seekers , aided by technological innovation , are leading to alternative models of knowledge dissemination . 
MOOCs , which first began in 2008 , allow students to hear lectures and read course material on - line , and earn a degree at a cost much lower than conventional education . 
Is it possible to become a world power without a single world class university ? 
In two reputed international rankings of universities , there is not a single entry from India against the top 200 places . 
I refuse to believe that despite having the second largest higher education system in the world , with over 700 universities and 36 , 000 colleges , we do not have even one truly outstanding institution . 
The fault lies in our casual approach . 
The rankings process should be taken seriously . 
A high rank can boost the morale of the academic community and open greater avenues of growth and placement for students . 
It can help attract the best faculty from India and abroad and provide a benchmark for continuous quality enhancement . 
Concrete action to present the credentials of our institutions is needed
Institutions must set up nodal authorities to handle data coordination . 
Some of the IITs have developed expertise in dealing with the ratings process . 
They can act as knowledge partners to other institutions . 
As a result of concerted efforts , India today has nine institutions in top 50 in the BRICS region , with the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore at the 5th position . 
I hope the success in the BRICS rating will extend to other international ratings . 
Our country is beset with problems like drinking water , sanitation , energy availability , urbanization , and poverty that call for innovative solutions . 
These challenges must ring the bells in the laboratories , corridors and classrooms of our higher academic institutions . 
Unfortunately , research in most institutes is marked by a certain degree of neglect . 
The eco - system for cutting - edge research is missing . 
This general apathy is reflected in some indicators . 
India has 160 researchers in R & D per one million people compared to 710 in Brazil and 1 , 020 in China . 
In high technology exports also , India does not fare well . 
The Make in Indiacampaign aims at facilitating investment , promoting innovation , fostering skill development and establishing best - in - class manufacturing infrastructure . 
Our universities and engineering and research institutions must take up this challenge and make India a hub for technology - based products . 
They must build a research culture and promote research activity at all levels . 
Our institutes of higher learning must leverage their linkages with key stakeholders . 
Academic institutes in India must develop partnerships with reputed international institutions . 
A win - win mode of interaction could be exchange of faculty ; collaborative research ; and sharing of academic resources like course material and resource persons . 
An increased interaction by setting up industry - interface cells and induction of industry experts in governance structures of our institutes can pave the way for sponsorship of chairs ; support for research projects ; and setting up of incubation centres and laboratories . 
Alumni have an emotional connect with their alma mater . 
An institution can draw the expertise and experience of some of their illustrious alumni for academic management through governing bodies . 
They can also be drafted for business and project mentoring , and curriculum design . 
A higher educational institution has to interact with the society at large . 
Its soft power of persuasion and influence extends beyond its classrooms . 
Adoption of some neighbourhood villages to effect holistic change and transform them into model villages can be a very good beginning . 
Before I conclude , here is a piece of advice from Mahatma Gandhi , which we will do well to remember : 
Literary education is of no value , if it is not able to build up a sound character . 
I once again wish all of you a very happy and rewarding academic year ahead . 
Let the time be spent in fruitful pursuits , meaningful opportunities and significant achievements . 
SPEECH BY HON’BLE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE BANQUET HOSTED IN HONOUR OF HIS EXCELLENCY , MR . FILIPE NYUSI , THE PRESIDENT OF REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
It is my privilege to receive you on your first State Visit to India . 
On behalf of our Government and people , I extend a warm welcome to you , Madam Isaura Nyusi and the distinguished members of your delegation . 
It is a matter of satisfaction , indeed , that your State Visit is taking place at a time when India and Mozambique are commemorating 40 years of the establishment of our diplomatic relations . 
I take this opportunity to also congratulate you and the people of Mozambique as you celebrate the 40thanniversary of your independence . 
Mr . President , although our people - to - people ties go down the centuries , our friendship in modern times dates back to the days of your freedom movement . 
Having ourselves thrown off the yoke of foreign rule to gain our country’s independence in 1947 , it was only natural for India to extend support to the friendly people of Mozambique in their struggle . 
The people of India were , indeed , pleased to witness the independence of Mozambique in 1975 . 
India is glad to see that since then , Mozambique has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty , enhancing literacy , providing primary healthcare to its people and significantly increasing its agricultural production . 
By ensuring internal peace and stability in the last two decades and taking up wide - ranging reforms , Mozambique has transformed itself into one of the fastest growing economies in Africa . 
In this regard , Excellency , your emphasis on creating a " society of inclusion " is commendable . 
I assure you , Excellency , that India remains committed to supporting the development of Mozambique - through our bilateral trade and investment , technical assistance and capacity building programmes , and the continued financing of your development projects . 
There is ample scope for building upon the many complementarities between our economies and for expanding our collaboration in several fields including agriculture , food processing , healthcare and in the exploitation of your significant natural resources . 
India values its cooperation with Mozambique in international fora , including the United Nations , the Commonwealth and the Indian Ocean Rim Association . 
Our two countries share a common commitment to the reforms of institutions of global governance – so that they better reflect the aspirations of developing countries . 
We greatly appreciate your support to our candidature for permanent membership of an expanded UN Security Council . 
In this 70th year of the United Nations , we look forward to working together with Mozambique and our partners in the African Union and the Southern African Development Community to pursue these long awaited reforms . 
Excellency , I take this opportunity to reiterate that India remains deeply committed to its partnership with Africa . 
This is demonstrated by the success of the India Africa Forum Summits which began in 2008 . 
India will be hosting the 3rd Summit of the Forum in October this year . 
We look forward to Mozambique ' s active participation in the summit . 
I have no doubt that the Summit will provide new and creative ideas for enhancing the socio - economic development of our peoples . 
Excellency , our success is already a good example of mutually beneficial South - South Cooperation . 
I am confident that the new areas of focus identified during your visit will further strengthen our enduring partnership . 
With these words , Excellency , I wish you and Madam Isaura Nyusi an enjoyable and fruitful visit to India . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , may I request you to join me in raising a toast : - 
- to the health , happiness and well - being of His Excellency President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi and Madam Isaura Nyusi ; 
- to the well - being and prosperity of the people of Mozambique ; and
- to lasting friendship between India and Mozambique . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE INAUGURATION OF THE CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS OF THE FEDERATION OF KARNATAKA CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY ( FKCCI ) 
It is my privilege to be here this evening to inaugurate the Centenary Celebrations of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( FKCCI ) . 
I congratulate you all on your journey so far and reaching this important milestone . 
I understand this federation was established as the Mysore Chamber of Commerce in 1916 by Sir M . Visvesvaraya . 
It is today a premier organization for industry , trade and service sectors in Karnataka . 
Bharat Ratna Visvesvaraya was an engineering genius , visionary , statesman and scholar . 
Even prior to India’s independence , he spearheaded the movement for industrialization with his slogan ‘industrialize or perish’ . 
This federation as well , has contributed in transforming the vision of Visvesvaraya into reality . 
It has played a catalytic role in policy - making , representing business and industry in government bodies , providing a platform to businessmen for discussion , and interacting and working with the government to resolve problems faced by the industry . 
It has disseminated information on business and economy , organized seminars , workshops and training programmes , and published books and papers on subjects in its domain of work . 
It has promoted international trade by organizing meetings with visiting foreign business delegations , and facilitating the participation of Indian industry delegations in trade fairs abroad . 
As this august industry body enters its one hundredth year of service , it is heartening to note its contribution to the economic development of Karnataka . 
Karnataka is one of the leading states driving India’s economy . 
It contributes 6 percent of India’s GDP , 7 percent of fixed capital and 13 percent of her exports . 
Many important public sector enterprises like Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited , Hindustan Aeronautics Limited , Bharat Electronics Limited and BEML were established here soon after India’s independence . 
Successive governments in Karnataka have implemented proactive and business friendly policies . 
Karnataka is propelling growth , crafting careers and creating wealth through a potent mix of resource and skill oriented , and technology and knowledge based products and services . 
It is one of the most technology savvy states in India , with a tradition of employing technology across various sectors of the economy . 
I am told that Karnataka is home to over 1 , 000 large and medium manufacturing industries in sectors like machine tool , steel , cement , automobile , and aerospace . 
Nearly 60 percent of biotech units in India are also located here . 
It has about 1 , 200 companies in information technology ( IT ) sector . 
It is a leader in IT and IT enabled - services sector that accounts for more than 40 percent of India’s software exports . 
Bengaluru is rightly dubbed the Silicon Valley of India . 
These industrial enterprises apart , Karnataka’s 600 textile units and a large agro - based industry provide substantial employment opportunities to the youth . 
The growing importance of MSME sector in industrialization and employment generation is clearly visible in Karnataka . 
Karnataka has a supportive eco - system that has transformed it into a prominent hub in the global industrial landscape . 
Its entrepreneurial spirit in innovation and R & D has been recognized the world over . Its rich natural resources , proactive policies , talented workforce and strong economy have propelled the state to become a preferred investment destination in diverse sectors like aerospace , automobiles and auto - components , IT , bio - technology , food processing and healthcare . 
More than eighty Fortune 500 companies and 700 multi - nationals are based here . 
Karnataka’s growth story mirrors the growth journey of India . 
At an average of 7 . 8 percent per year during the last ten years , India’s economic performance has been impressive . 
Even more creditable is the fact that India’s economy withstood well the global economic slowdown precipitated by the financial crisis of 2008 . Our GDP grew at 8 . 6 and 8 . 9 percent in 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 11 , respectively . 
Fiscal expansionary measures helped in maintaining the growth momentum amidst downturn anxieties emanating from the global markets . 
The experience of the developed economies in the past few years suggests that an economy at full employment , but with inflation higher than the normal may be better positioned to withstand a bout of financial stress than one that is flirting with deflation . 
In our case we have also seen that business sentiments once broken and depressed may take considerable time to mend and revive the growth momentum . 
India’s economy has been fairly resilient to the global financial crisis of 2008 . 
Growth momentum was impacted , but recovery has been significant and rapid in comparison to trends witnessed elsewhere in the world . 
Macro - economic parameters like inflation and external sector balance have improved in the past year . 
The current account deficit has narrowed to 1 . 7 percent of GDP in April - December 2014 from 2 . 3 percent in the corresponding period last year . 
At over 350 billion US Dollars , we now have comfortable foreign exchange reserves to meet the next set of challenges from global economic developments . 
Given the macro - economic prospects , our economic growth should regain the 8 percent plus level soon . 
In a country like ours , there is no greater imperative than a robust and sustained economicgrowth . 
Achievinghigh growth is a potent tool to fight the scourge of poverty . 
The proportion of population living below poverty line in our country declined from 37 . 2 per cent in 2004 - 05 to 21 . 9 per cent in 2011 - 12 . 
About 85 million people were lifted out of poverty during the three year period 2009 - 10 to 2011 - 12 . 
For a nation aspiring to be among the developed economies of the world it is not enough to be satisfied merely by poverty alleviation . 
We have to commit ourselves to the goal of poverty elimination . 
To my mind , a lasting solution to the problem of poverty and inequality is generation of gainful employment opportunities and creation of a skilled labour force . 
The government’s focus on Make - in - India , Skilling India and Digital India are geared to achieve that objective . 
I urge the industry to take part through its CSR activities and lend a helping hand in taking these initiatives to their logical end . 
Developing businesses into models of excellence calls for deeper application of management principles . 
It also requires a better appreciation of the socio - economic realities . 
Businesses are meant not only to earn profits for their shareholders but also to add value to the society at large . 
Industry leaders would do well to build this gospel of doing business into their corporate work culture . 
Let me conclude by complimenting the federation once again . I wish all of you the very best for the future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF INAUGURATION OF CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS OF UNIVERSITY OF MYSORE
It is my pleasure to be here on this historic occasion to inaugurate the Centenary Celebrations of University of Mysore . 
It is one of the oldest universities in our country . 
I am also happy to have the opportunity to visit Mysore . 
With Chamundi Hills as its backdrop , this city is dotted with beautiful palaces and attractive Indo - Saracenic buildings . 
Mysore is an academic hub today , comprising prestigious institutions in wide array of disciplines – from ayurveda to medicine , management to engineering , law and commerce . 
The University of Mysore , which is headquartered here , has pioneered higher education in Karnataka . 
It was founded under the patronage of ‘Rajarshi’ Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar and with the able assistance of Diwan Sir M . Visvesvaraya in 1916 . 
Both Rajarshi Wadiyar and Diwan Visvesvaraya were steadfast in their commitment to bring enlightenment to the people of this state . 
The Maharaja in the first convocation of this University in 1918 had eloquently said of Visvesvaraya , which I now quote : " I feel that I should acknowledge on this public occasion a debt of gratitude from myself and my people to Sir M . Visvesvaraya the Diwan of my state . It is chiefly his patriotism , his enthusiasm and his unflinching advocacy which converted what was once little more than a dream of the future into a living creation and his name will always be remembered above all others , as the man to whom our university owes its being”
On this occasion , I would like to recall the names of some of the stalwarts - the first Vice Chancellor Shri H . V . Nanjundayya , Dr . Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , Dr . Brajendranath Seal , Dr . C . R . Reddy , Prof Thomas Denham , Prof A . R . Wadia , Prof M . Hiriyanna , Dr . K . V . Puttappa ( Kuvempu ) and Dr . D . Javare Gowda - who shaped the destiny of this great university . 
The others who followed kept the flag of this institution flying high , capitalizing on the rich legacy and moving forward with purposive action . 
In 1960 , all the post - graduate departments were brought together in one location - the beautifulMana - sagan - gothri - where we are assembled today . 
This campus was named so by Vice Chancellor Kuvempu who was also a poet laureate . 
He emphasized the use of mother tongue as the medium to communicate and inspired innumerable scholars to write textbooks for higher education . 
Due to the vision of its academic leaders and hard work of others associated with it , University of Mysore has been a story of progress . 
Beginning with 11 departments , I am told that it now has 54 post - graduate departments , two post - graduate centres , one satellite centre , four constituent colleges , 49 research centres and 38 outreach centres . 
It has 85 , 000 students on its rolls including 1 , 400 students from 64 countries . 
What started as a small rivulet has assumed the proportion of a roaring river today . 
I compliment you all and urge you to keep going ! 
The motto of this University is derived from ashloka that Krishna told Arjuna in the battlefield of Kurukshetra , which I quote : 
Nahi Jnanen Sadrusham Pavitra Iha Vidyate” ( unquote ) , which means , there is no purified in the world like knowledge . 
The founding fathers of this centre of higher learning wanted education to be taken to the doorsteps of the common man . 
At the assembly of Vice Chancellors in Cambridge in 1934 , Prof J . C . Rollo , Principal of Maharaja’s College , spoke about the ‘Mysore Experiment’ , where the university professors with their erudition and knowledge went to villages and remote areas to share their wisdom . 
The Vice Chancellors attending the Conference declared their intention to replicate this model . 
Eight decades later , this method of knowledge propagation is still relevant in our country . 
In that context , I have said elsewhere that ‘a university is the banyan tree whose roots lie in basic education , in a vast network of schools that build the intellectual prowess of our communities ; we have to invest in every part of this knowledge tree , from seed , root and branch to the highest leaf’ . 
I wish to see your academic leaders continue their engagement with the society at large in disseminating knowledge . 
ndia with two - third of her 1 . 25 billion people below 35 years of age holds great prospects to become one of the front ranking nations in the world . 
To unleash the potential of her energetic youth , a world - class educational system is necessary . 
Though India’s higher education is the second largest in the world , the enrolment rate at 20 percent is not enough to improve the future prospects of the youth and harnessing opportunities in an increasingly knowledge intensive world . 
Many bright scholars go abroad for higher studies for want of good quality institutions in our country . 
The government has made considerable efforts to expand the higher education sector by starting new IITs , NITs and central universities , besides other institutions . 
Even the private sector has started contributing significantly to this expansion in higher education . 
However , if an objective analysis of the state of higher education in our country is undertaken today , it is easy to suggest that there are only a handful of higher education institutions possessing the quality to produce graduates for the global market . 
Indian institutions are absent from the top 200 positions in world university rankings published by reputed agencies . 
Transforming the higher education sector requires innovative changes on several fronts . Availability of good faculty is one . 
Teaching must be made more attractive as a career option for bright students . 
To inject new thinking and diversity in pedagogy , faculty must also be hired from abroad . 
Faculty development through exchange programmes , participation in seminars and workshops , and joint research and project work with academic and industry partners is another area we need to lay emphasis on . 
If faculty is the lifeblood of a higher education institution , then a good governance structure is its taproot . 
Good governance must play a central role in the growth of an institution . 
For that , it must identify and incorporate expertise from varied fields including industry and alumni , to support considered decision - making processes in the academic institutions . 
A concerted effort to involve the industry in academic affairs could reap benefits in terms of sponsorship of research endowments , creations of chairs , conduct of internship programmes and improvement in the employability of students . 
Present - day higher education institutions ought to apply dynamic learning models . 
They must deploy technology to efficiently disseminate academic material to greater number of students , engage resource persons through e - platforms , and establish linkages with research and other academic institutions . 
Collaborative partnerships must be aimed at pursuing frontier research and creating synergy in the development of new concepts for furthering human wellbeing . 
There is unfortunately a general neglect of research in our universities . 
This must be reversed . Our country grapples with many socio - economic problems and answers to many of them have eluded us so far . 
We must identify areas that call for innovative solutions and facilitate our universities and institutions to undertake research programmes . 
We must adopt a multi - disciplinary approach as most research activity requires the meeting of minds from multiple domains . 
Our universities must promote scientific temper amongst students . 
A way forward could be to give wings to the ingenuous ideas of students and grassroots innovators . 
The initiative of setting up Innovation Clubs taken up in several Central Universities could be replicated by others . 
It will act as a platform where novel ideas are nurtured and innovators mentored to develop new products . 
I urge you to spearhead an innovation movement in this region . 
Let me conclude by complimenting your institution on celebrating its one hundred years of fruitful service to the people . 
Accept my best wishes for a successful conduct of your year - long centenary festivities , which I am happy to note , includes a theme song , play , documentary and a film about your history . 
Best of luck for the future ! 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE 6th CONVOCATION OF DR . D . Y . PATIL VIDYAPEETH
I am indeed very happy to have this opportuinity of being present amidst you for the Sixth Convocation of Dr . D . Y . Patil Vidyapeeth . 
It is one of the important centres of learning in the higher education landscape of our country . 
This Vidyapeeth was established in 2003 with a vision ‘to see enlightened , cultured and economically vibrant India , developed through education in diverse disciplines’ . 
Under the inspiring leadership of Dr . P . D . Patil and a team of highly dedicated teachers , this Institute has over the last twelve years contributed significantly towards the fulfilment of this objective . 
I congratulate all of you for the progress made so far in terms of its remarkable growth and enhanced prestige . 
It is heartening to note that this Institute has been awarded with an ‘A’ grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council . 
University is at the top of the formal education pyramid . 
It is , therefore , incumbent on universities to guide the direction of progress of the society . 
Ancient India had a tradition of world - class learning , represented by renowned universities at Nalanda , Takshashila , Vikramashila , Valabhi , Odantapuri and Somapura . 
These seats of learning dominated the world education system in higher education for eighteen hundred years beginning sixth century BC . 
This system started declining from twelfth century AD . Unfortunately , Indian higher education is yet to regain that frontline position . 
According to rankings by reputed agencies , no Indian institution feature in the list of top 200 universities in the world . 
I have been making this remark before higher academic institutions almost as a ritual now . 
My sole purpose is to impress upon the universities to adopt a more methodical approach to the ratings process and also effect holistic changes for better academic management . 
It can also help retain meritorious students who otherwise want to avail of higher education abroad . 
How do we transform our universities into great learning centres . 
At first , there is need to link education with research and innovation in a seamless manner . 
Education disseminates knowledge while research creates new knowledge . 
Innovation converts that knowledge into wealth and social good . 
Promoting inter - disciplinary research and research at under - graduate level , boosting collaborative research and joint research papers , and encouraging bright students to enter the research field are some of the steps required in this direction . 
Emphasis is being laid on research at the Vidyapeeth right from the beginning . 
I am glad to know that PhD programme in all specialties was started in 2009 and that 22 PhD degrees have been awarded today . 
Particular focus is called for nurturing innovative ideas . 
The ingenuity of the grassroots innovators require mentoring for development of viable products useful to the common man . 
Innovation clubs have been set up in several central institutions to act as a bridge between the academic community and innovators . 
I wish to see such platform being built in our private institutions as well . 
Changes needed in academic institutions are multi - dimensional . 
Adequate availability of good quality faculty must be ensured . 
Faculty must use latest pedagogy relying on ICT solutions for effective delivery of instructions
Faculty also must upgrade their knowledge of a subject through participation in refresher courses and seminars . 
Institutions must create synergy with other institutions for research partnerships , and sharing of course material and subject experts . 
Institutions must also establish networks with the industry for guidance on projects , course design and internship programmes . 
Our universities are the torchbearers of socio - economic development . 
The relevance of its teaching must extend beyond the classrooms , to the society and the nation . 
At the same time , they must through their own example usher in socio - economic change . 
The Government initiatives aimed at faster economic development , namely Swachh Bharat , Adarsh Gram , Digital India and Make - in - India , have the potential to lift India to the state of an advanced nation . 
Their successful implementation calls for participation by a wide section of the society . Our education , training , research and innovation must contribute to these national objectives . 
Our education model must not only develop the mind but also create positive mind - sets . 
Expanding a student’s ability must go hand in hand with building his attitude . 
A creative mind - set combined with a positive attitude can help unearth solutions to problems afflicting the society like malnutrition , affordable healthcare , efficient energy use , drinking water and sanitation . 
The objective of education is not merely the acquisition of knowledge and the production of competent manpower . 
At a macro level , education leads to nation - building . 
At the micro level , it must result in character - building in students . 
On this revered occasion , I am reminded of a Sanskrit Shubhashit from the Chanakya Niti Shastra . 
With these words , I conclude . 
I once again compliment all the students for their success . 
I also wish the Vidyapeeth the very best for the future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE BANQUET HOSTED IN HONOUR OF DR . JAKAYA MRISHO KIKWETE , THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
It is a great pleasure and privilege for me to receive you today , Mr . President , on your first State Visit to India . 
On behalf of the Government and the people of India , I extend a warm welcome to you and Madam Salma Kikwete - and the distinguished members of your delegation . 
Your Excellency , the people of India know Tanzania as a land of magnificent lakes , rich wildlife reserves and the mighty , snow - capped Kilimanjaro . 
We appreciate Tanzania as a nation of gracious and hard working people , living in peace and harmony . 
Tanzania evokes in us fond memories of its iconic founder - leader , Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and his close friendship with India’s Founding Fathers . 
In particular , we remember him for his contribution to South - South Co - operation . 
Under your leadership , Excellency , Tanzania has made commendable progress . 
It stands tall on the world stage - among the fastest growing economies of the world . 
We applaud your success in reducing poverty and hunger in Tanzania . 
We welcome your successful efforts for achieving peace in your region . India has similar goals - of accelerated economic development and inclusive growth within our country and also greater progress and prosperity in our region . 
As two vibrant nations with age - old ties and many common interests , our joint efforts are an inspiring example of South - South Co - operation . 
India and Tanzania have a shared commitment to international peace and stability . 
We both desire to see that the fruits of globalisation are enjoyed more equitably . 
Mr . President , India values the close co - operation that we have with Tanzania in multilateral fora . 
It is our firm belief that nations such as ours should make common cause to ensure that the institutions of global governance address our concerns and meet the aspirations of developing countries . 
We have taken the initiative , along with other developing countries , to pursue reforms in the United Nations and its key organisations , particularly the Security Council . We are grateful for your support to our claim for permanent membership of the UN Security Council . 
Excellency , I take this opportunity to reiterate that India is deeply committed to its partnership with Africa . 
We consider the people of Africa as brothers on journey to a common destination . 
I recall your previous visit to India in 2008 as Co - chairman of the 1st India - Africa Forum Summit . 
Since its inception , this Forum has symbolised the shared interests of roughly one - fourth of the world’s geographical area and one - third of humanity . 
India will have the privilege of hosting the 3rd India - Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi in October this year . 
I am confident that the Summit will result in new initiatives and innovative ideas for the development , growth and advancement of all our peoples . 
We look forward to Tanzania’s active participation in this event . 
With these words , Excellency , I once again welcome you and Madam Salma Kikwete and wish you a very fruitful visit to India . 
May I now request you to join me in raising a toast to : 
- the good health and success of His Excellency , President Jakaya Kikwete and Madam Salma Kikwete ; 
- to the continued progress and prosperity of the people of the United Republic of Tanzania ; and
- to the enduring friendship between India and Tanzania . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE JOINT BUSINESS COUNCIL MEETING
It gives me great pleasure to address this gathering of eminent business representatives from India and Belarus . 
Trade , investment and economic cooperation form one of the most important facets of contemporary India - Belarus relations . 
As we seek to elevate our bilateral relationship , it is our business communities that possess the maximum potential to transform and energize these ties . 
I am delighted that a large business delegation from India is here today . 
They represent an array of sectors such as Energy , Consulting Services , Healthcare , Chemicals , Fertilizers , Information Technology , Infrastructure , Utilities & Renewable Energy , Manufacturing and Pharmaceuticals . 
I am happy to see that they are joined by many counterparts representing business and industry in Belarus . 
India and Belarus have a long history of friendship and multi - faceted cooperation for mutual benefit . 
Our political dialogue is regular and substantive . 
One of the significant aspects of our relationship has been the excellent understanding between our countries on international issues and support for each other in multilateral fora such as the United Nations . 
We have set up excellent institutional mechanisms to promote economic and trade linkages , defence cooperation as well as scientific and technological research . 
We have signed the necessary enabling Agreements and MOUs in a wide range of areas of shared interest and a few more have been signed during my visit . Our cultural relations and the interactions between our peoples are strong . 
We have signed the necessary enabling Agreements and MOUs in a wide range of areas of shared interest and a few more have been signed during my visit . 
Our cultural relations and the interactions between our peoples are strong . 
There is wide popular support in both our countries for enhancing our relations . 
My visit reflects India’s deep interest in strengthening our partnership with Belarus . 
As you are aware , India is emerging as one of the largest economies in the world and one of the fastest growing emerging markets with an average annual growth rate of more than 7 per cent over the past decade . 
There are positive signals that suggest that we may be moving to an even higher growth path . 
Consolidation measures have improved our fiscal position , price levels have come down , our manufacturing sector is in a nascent stage of revival and agricultural growth has remained robust . 
Measures aimed at stimulating investment , both domestic and foreign , have worked in tandem with strengthening macro - economic fundamentals to kick - start the Indian economy . 
There is also a renewed focus on implementation of projects , especially in infrastructure . 
I had excellent discussions with President Lukashenko yesterday . 
Our talks have convinced me that we share the same enthusiasm and desire to expand our bilateral relations . 
With a view to further energizing bilateral co - operation , we have issued a very substantive and focussed Roadmap on the India - Belarus partnership . 
I am sure you would have noticed that the Roadmap focuses extensively on economic , trade , investment and technology partnerships . 
Our bilateral trade turnover is modest and way below its real potential . 
I am , however , optimistic - my interactions with President Lukashenko make me hopeful that we can increase our trade to a level of US $ 1 billion by the year 2020 . 
I am confident that this level is achievable if we expand the range of items in our trade basket , increase the share of high - technology and value - added products and enhance exchanges and cooperation in the services sector , such as healthcare , IT , financial services , transport and logistics . 
To facilitate trade , both governments are keen to intensify cooperation in quality control , quarantine , certification of goods and standardization as well as simplification of customs formalities . 
We will work together , bilaterally and in the context of the proposed partnership between India and the Eurasian Economic Union , to address any existing trade barriers and to avoid introduction of new barriers to trade . 
In this context , I am happy to announce that India has decided to grant ‘Market Economy Status’ to Belarus . 
This will be a significant step towards enhancing our bilateral trade and also in promoting greater integration of Belarus in international trade structures . 
However , even as governments implement facilitating measures , greater trade can be realised only if businesses on both sides participate wholeheartedly in this process . 
I would like to call upon companies from India and Belarus to increase their engagement in trade fairs as well as national , international and regional exhibitions held in both countries respectively . 
Companies should also seek to participate more actively in international tenders of both governments , even as governmental agencies on both sides enhance information sharing to ensure that this is realised . 
The Roadmap for India - Belarus relations clearly identifies the key sectors for our future cooperation . 
These include conventional and small - scale power generation , new and renewable energy , metallurgy and mining , defence , automotive and agricultural engineering , pharmaceuticals , textiles , agriculture and food processing . 
All these sectors offer promising opportunities for investment . 
Of course , this is not an exhaustive list but an indicative one , where there are immediate and promising prospects for synergy . 
I am also happy to inform you that India would be extending a new line of credit of US $ 100 million to Belarus to encourage joint projects in mutually identified sectors . 
India and Belarus are committed to take all possible measures to enhance FDI in both directions , including through actively supporting commercial and investment fora such as this event . 
Joint ventures between India and Belarus can become even more attractive in the framework of the larger market of the Eurasian Economic Union . 
To create the necessary enablers for greater trade and investment flows , we are seeking to enhance cooperation in the financial sector and to make available necessary financial instruments for funding of bilateral projects , financing trade and joint projects and providing export support and insurance . 
Wherever possible , we will work with international financial organizations in this regard . 
As both Belarus and India are nations with a tradition of scientific and technological research , our bilateral partnership in these areas can benefit tremendously if the forces of innovation and entrepreneurship could combine with our existing strengths in research . 
I , therefore , urge the companies and businesses present here to explore avenues for technical cooperation in areas such as new and renewable energy , space , the chemical industry , automotive industry including special vehicles , IT , telecommunications , transport , construction and industrial infrastructure . 
To support this , our governments need to create a favourable eco - system for attracting leading R & D institutions and universities . 
Both Governments need to also take measures , as may be necessary , for encouraging and inducing implementation of innovative projects , particularly in high - tech areas such as optical , laser , nano and bio - technologies , electronics and microelectronics and mechanical engineering . 
India is happy to note that Belarus is keen to see greater participation of Indian companies engaged in nanotechnologies , bio - technologies , electronics , microelectronics and mechanical engineering in their " Great Stone” Industrial Park and the " BelBioGrad” National Scientific and Technological Park . 
I would encourage Indian investors to consider this actively . 
I also call upon Belarusian companies to explore investment and scientific opportunities available in the many industrial and technology parks in India , as a means of enhancing their participation in the Indian economy . 
I am confident that greater Business to Business interactions between India and Belarus will create greater awareness of the vast economic opportunities in the Indian economy and encourage companies from Belarus to engage with India . 
I thank you for inviting me to share my views with you today . 
I also take this opportunity to wish all of you the very best in your endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE RECEPTION HOSTED BY THE AMBASSADOR OF INDIA
I am particularly honoured to be the first Head of State from India to visit this beautiful country . 
Since I arrived , I have had the privilege to interact with the leading personalities of Belarus in politics , academia , science and technology , industry , culture and sports . 
I have had very good discussions earlier today with His Excellency the President of Belarus . 
My interaction with Your Excellency , Mr . Prime Minister and the other leaders that I have met during my visit , have strengthened my conviction that the traditionally warm ties of friendship and co - operation between India and Belarus will intensify and strengthen in the days to come . 
India attaches great value to our friendship and co - operation with Belarus . 
Our common interests in the field of science and technology , our complementarities in the fields of information technology and engineering , our collaboration in energy and in pharmaceuticals - as well as our close cooperation in defence , have linked our countries in a long standing , fruitful partnership for mutual benefit . 
Even as we deepen our collaboration in these areas , we continue to explore new avenues in several areas of common interest – prioritising renewable energy , manufacturing , mining and vocational training . 
As you are aware , India is an old civilization with a young population . 
65 % of our population is presently below the age of 35 years . 
For investors and business partners , we are a fast growing economy and expanding market and , for tourists and academicians ours is a fascinating land of ancient culture and incredible regional diversities . Government of India is taking a number of initiatives to channelise our significant resources towards inclusive growth of all constituents of our economy and society – by encouraging investment , reviving the manufacturing sector , promoting skill development , developing smart cities and improving sanitation and cleanliness - especially of our rivers . 
We hope to see substantial involvement by all our partners and friends in India and abroad to translate these goals into reality . 
Belarus has competencies in many of these areas , especially in construction machinery , urban development , vocational training and niche areas of manufacturing and technology . 
I would emphasise that this is an opportune moment - Indian companies are also keen to partner with Belarus in these sectors . 
H . E . President Lukashenka and I will be addressing representatives of the business and industrial sectors of both our countries tomorrow and we will take the opportunity to share with them our common vision for the way forward in India – Belarus co - operation . 
Another key objective of my visit is to foster mutually beneficial linkages between premier academic and scientific institutions in India and Belarus . 
I am glad to see that the Indian Digital Learning Centre in Minsk has been successfully operating since January 2012 - and has imparted advanced IT training to a large number of IT professionals from Belarus . 
Several young people from Belarus have benefited from India’s ITEC training programmes . 
Belarus is popular with Indian students . 
We must encourage linkages in the education sector as an investment in capacity - building for future generations . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , I am indeed heartened to note the deep and widespread appreciation of Indian culture and traditions in Belarus . 
Many in Belarus have trained in classical Indian dance and music . 
I am glad that after completing their training , they are encouraged to further disseminate what they have learned – to other interested young people of Belarus . 
I note that ancient Indian scriptures are an area of considerable interest – and research - by learned academicians of this country . 
Last but not the least , Indian sportspersons could benefit from deeper cooperation in the area of sports between India and Belarus . 
We certainly have much to look forward to in our bilateral partnership . 
The small Indian community in Belarus , including our students , has been made to feel comfortable , welcome and secure here . 
For this , I thank the friendly people of Belarus – and call upon the members of the Indian community , as they live and work here , to continue to make a positive contribution by your endeavours . 
At the same time , I am confident you will play an invaluable role in strengthening the bonds of friendship between India and Belarus . 
With these words , I wish to extend to you all - and through you , to the friendly people of Belarus , warm greetings of the people of India and best wishes for your continued happiness , progress and prosperity . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT AT THE LUNCHEON BANQUET HOSTED IN HIS HONOUR BY THE PRESIDENT OF BELARUS
I am indeed delighted to be in Minsk on this first State Visit from India to Belarus . 
I thank you , Excellency , for your kind words of welcome and the gracious hospitality accorded to me and to my delegation . 
We have thoroughly enjoyed our visit to your beautiful , green and welcoming land . 
It is indeed a delight to experience the simplicity , warmth and affection of the people of Belarus . 
India and Belarus relations have a history of friendly and mutually enriching interactions . 
As I had mentioned to you during our talks , India’s national poet Rabindranath Tagore had visited Minsk in 1931 . 
He had very intense and fruitful discussions with leading intellectuals of your country on international and topical issues of the day . 
India and Belarus are the inheritors of this glorious philosophical and intellectual tradition . 
Since your emergence as an independent nation in 1991 , India and Belarus have successfully developed our relationship based on friendship and mutual benefit . 
Our ties today cut across practically all sectors , ranging from trade and economic cooperation , defence , science and technology and cultural and people to people exchanges . 
We also share common approaches to international issues . 
Our cooperation in the United Nations and other multilateral fora , including in the Non - Aligned Movement has been close and fruitful . 
This should continue . 
India deeply appreciates Belarus’ unequivocalendorsement of India ' s rightful claim to permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council . 
We are also delighted that Belarus fully supported India’s proposal to declare June 21 as International Day of Yoga in the United Nations General Assembly . 
India has and always will appreciate Belarus’ approach on issues of concern to it within the framework of international organisations . 
We have had the pleasure of receiving you twice in India as the President of Belarus , in 1997 and in 2007 . 
Your successful visits have contributed enormously in elevating our relations to a higher trajectory and in enhancing the quality of our dialogue . 
I am confident that our discussions today , and the various events being held in conjunction with my visit , would take India - Belarus relations to even greater heights . 
Let me reiterate that India remains fully committed to a deeper and more diversified relationship with Belarus . 
Even as we look back with satisfaction at the road we have traversed in building relations between our countries , we also recognise the need to re - dedicate ourselves to a further enhancement and deepening of our ties . 
We both agree that there is enormous untapped potential in our relationship . 
We have discussed several useful ideas and initiatives to enhance our cooperation . 
It is necessary that we implement them in the most effective manner . 
I would like to reiterate that we may focus our efforts on our economic and commercial cooperation , our defence ties as well as scientific and educational linkages . 
With these words , I thank you once again for your gracious hospitality . 
I also wish to invite you to visit India at a time of your convenience . 
It would be a pleasure to receive you in New Delhi again . 
I invite you to join me in raising a toast : 
To the good health of His Excellency Alexander Lukashenko , the President of the Republic of Belarus , 
To the continued progress and prosperity of the people of Belarus and
To the strengthening of friendship and co - operation between India and Belarus . 
PUBLIC LECTURE BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT UPPSALA UNIVERSITY , SWEDEN ON THE TOPIC ‘TAGORE GANDHI : DO THEY HAVE CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE FOR GLOBAL PEACE ? ’
It is a privilege for me to visit Uppsala University and share my thoughts on the contemporary relevance of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore , India’s national poet and the first non - European to win the Nobel Prize for literature as well as Mahatma Gandhi , the father of the Indian nation . 
I have spent two packed days in this beautiful country . 
Robust bonds bind our two countries , not the least , a steadfast devotion to democratic values and a fundamental commitment to global peace and non - violence . 
Global peace was a value both Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi espoused . 
To speak on this subject in Uppsala University is therefore particularly relevant for two reasons : 
First , Gurudev or Respected Teacher as Tagore was called by Mahatma Gandhi and the rest of our country visited Sweden in 1921 and 1926 . 
During his visit in 1921 , he also visited Uppsala where he met Nobel Laureate Archbishop Nathan Söderblom and familiarized himself with Odinslund , the historical royal burial site from Viking times . 
Thereafter , in an ecumenical spirit , he made a visit to the Cathedral . 
I express the deep gratitude of my delegation and myself , indeed of all my people , to theUniversity of Uppsala for having installed a bust of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore in its Department of Foreign Languages . 
This bust commemorates the centenary of the award of the Nobel Prize to Tagore and stands as a reminder of his special link to Uppsala . 
I am delighted to know that 27 of Tagore’s works have been translated into Swedish and are widely appreciated . 
The second reason I am particularly happy to be addressing you on the topic of world peace is because this hallowed centre of studies nurturedDag Hammarskjöld , a great Swede andthesecond Secretary - General of the United Nations . 
Hammarskjöldat the age of47years and 255days was the youngest to have held the post . 
He held office for two terms beginning from 1953 till his unfortunate demise on September 12 , 1960 in a plane accident in Congo . 
His contributions to the cause of peace brought him respect and popularity across the world . 
I wonder how many of you know that this noble diplomat was also blessed with immensespiritual wisdom . 
One of his legacies at the United Nations is the creation of the Room of Quiet , which exists to this day . 
Dag Hammarskjöld was aware that the first step towards finding peace outside is to find it within . 
He knew that meditation and quiet are important conditions for this quest . 
The Constitution of UNESCO begins with the following words , 
Since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed ; 
That ignorance of each other’s ways and lives has been a common cause , throughout the history of mankind , of that suspicion and mistrust between the peoples of the world through which their differences have all too often broken into war ; . . . 
These words ring as true today as they did when UNESCO was founded in 1945 . 
Enduring peace can only be established on the basis of humanity’s moral and intellectual solidarity . 
Political and economic agreements will not on their own build a lasting peace . Peace has to be founded on the belief that there is only one humanity and , to use Tagore’s words : 
" Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls” . 
Rabindranath Tagore was a renaissance man and such men are found rarely in history . 
In their personality , they capture not just the times they live in but also many complex questions that transcend geography and are pertinent for all countries and communities across the world . 
Tagore was a versatile genius . 
He was not just a poet and author , but also a composer , painter , philosopher and educationist . 
He was the perfect ambassador of our country at a time when little was known about India in the outside world . 
Throughout his life , he was fascinated by the idea of interaction between civilizations through the exchange of knowledge about their cultures and literatures which reflect the universal values of humanity . 
In a world fettered by race , creed and colour , Rabindranath Tagore promoted internationalism for a new world order based on diversity , open - mindedness , tolerance and co - existence . 
He travelled far and wide preaching the religion of truth and harmony , and of love and compassion . 
Tagore’s views on ‘nationalism’ reveal his distaste for parochialism , racial divide and social stratification . 
He firmly believed that world peace could never be achieved until big and powerful nations curbed their desire for territorial expansion and control over smaller nations . 
In his view , war was a consequence of aggressive western materialism that developed in the early part of the 20th century , with science divorced from spirituality . 
According to the Poet , the East and the West must meet on a common ground and on terms of equal fellowship : 
" where knowledge flows in two streams - from the East and from the West " and " in their unity is perceived the oneness of Truth that pervades and sustains the entire Universe . ”
As he put it pithily : " It was Buddha who conquered the world , not Alexander . ”
If Tagore was the intellectual and spiritual torch bearer of global peace , it was theMahatmaor the Great Soul who showed the world thatSatyagraha or Truth Force andAhimsaor Non - Violence can be marshalled to create a more just world . 
Mahatma Gandhi commenced his experiments with the use of truth against violence in South Africa and then developed it to create in India a peace movement of a kind the world had never before seen . 
This movement not only resulted in the independence of India but also heralded the end of colonialism worldwide . 
I am happy to inform this audience that on January 09 of this year , we in India marked a hundred years since Gandhiji’s return from South Africa . 
Gandhiji said ; ‘My Life is My Message’ . 
Our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in her foreword to the 90thVolume of the monumental compilation of Gandhiji’s writings – ‘The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi’ , explained the significance of these words . 
She wrote : " He was one of those who spoke as he thought and acted as he spoke , one of those few on whom no shadow fell between word and deed . 
His words were deeds , and they built a movement and a nation and changed the lives of countless individuals” . 
What is this shadow that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi spoke of ? 
It is the shadow of untruth and falsehood . 
Only a person who saw Truth as God could speak of Life itself as a message . 
The Apostle of non - violence , Mahatma Gandhi had the same profound faith in humanism and openness of mind as Tagore did . 
He said I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed . 
I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible . 
But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any . 
I refuse to live in other people’s houses as an interloper , a beggar or a slave . 
Gandhiji , like Tagore , had an abiding concern with Nature and the unique placement of human consciousness in an intricate , intimate and harmonious relationship with nature . 
Another important message Gandhiji gave was that economics is of no use without ethics . 
This simple injunction creates a moral frame within which human ingenuity has to function . 
The limits to human greed have to be defined by inner imperatives and not external constraints . 
This inner imperative that he called beautifully " still small voice” [ 9 ] is available to all of us , if we cultivate the capability to listen and follow its dictates . 
By placing ethics at the heart of economics , Gandhiji gave us an idea whose significance is timeless . 
This is the idea of Trusteeship based on faith which is a unique human capacity . 
All of us live by and through trust . Gandhiji asked us to be Trustees and to have faith in the goodness of our hearts and the hearts of others . 
This goodness would enable us to act as Trustees of what are both ours and not ours . 
For Mahatma Gandhiji , Ahimsawas not just a method or an instrument . 
It requires recognition of the humanity of others , including the humanity of those we seek to challenge . 
Ahimsa is based on the idea that others are capable of recognising Truth and acting upon it however misguided or even oppressive they might be in the short term . 
Ahimsais not just non - injury . 
It is an active force that embraces the other , eradicating differences between I and You . 
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore and Gandhiji both recognised that the use ofAhimsawill eventually free the unjust and the oppressor from the need and desire to perpetuate injustice and suffering to others . 
It happens rarely in history that two seers , two persons who are capable of addressing not only their times but generations to come , work in close dialogue . 
The simultaneous presence of Poet Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi is a unique blessing that modern India received and we believe that this good fortune places upon us a special responsibility to involve ourselves actively in the promotion of dialogue amongst different religions , faiths , cultures and civilizations . 
India , with its population of 1 . 25 billion has been home to the harmonious mingling of ethnicities and religions for centuries . 
We are clear that lasting peace can be built only on a foundation of mutual respect which was consistently and eloquently advocated by both Tagore and Gandhiji . 
Mahatma Gandhi influenced many leaders across the world through his thoughts and action includingMartin Luther King Jr , Lech Wałęsa , Steve Biko , Nelson Mandela , Desmond Tutu , Dalai Lama and Aung San Suu Kyi . Martin Luther King Jr went to the extent of saying , " Christ furnished the spirit and motivation , while Gandhi furnished their method . ”
He said on another occasion : If humanity is to progress , Gandhi is inescapable . 
He lived , thought and acted , inspired by the vision of humanity evolving toward a world of peace and harmony . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE STATE BANQUET HOSTED BY HIS MAJESTY THE KING OF SWEDEN
I thank Your Majesty for your gracious words . It is indeed a privilege to make this first ever State Visit by a President of India to Sweden . 
I deeply appreciate the splendid welcome and the gracious hospitality accorded to me and to my delegation . 
Your Majesty , India attaches great importance to its long standing friendship with Sweden . 
Though our two nations are geographically distant from each other , we are bound by our common commitment to democratic values and practice . 
We are both open , pluralistic societies that are committed to the protection of human rights and the Rule of Law . 
We have , over the years , developed mutual trust and goodwill that has brought our people together to achieve our common goals in many sectors . 
Our bilateral relations have never been better and our people share a desire to see the enhancement of our co - operation to its full potential . 
Your Majesty , our countries have similar views on many issues of regional and global concern . 
We have been co - operating closely in the United Nations and other multilateral fora - where India appreciates the support that we have received and continue to receive from Sweden . 
We are grateful for your endorsement of India ' s rightful claim to Permanent Membership of the United Nations Security Council and for your proactive efforts that helped India achieve Observer status in the Arctic Council during the period of Sweden’s Chairmanship . 
Your Majesty , you made a State Visit to India in 1993 and subsequently in 2005 on the Royal Technology Mission . 
It has been a decade since then - and over these years , I am happy to say , India has seen dramatic progress in many sectors . 
The new Government in India has taken a number of initiatives to encourage investments , boost the manufacturing sector in India , promote skill development , develop smart cities and engage closely with all interested partners and investors – both in India and abroad - to realise these objectives . 
I am confident that the bilateral agreements that we have signed during my visit will lead to further fruitful engagement in the many fields where India and Sweden have obvious complementarities . 
It was just over a hundred years ago that our great philosopher and poet , Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore , received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913 . 
He was not only the first Indian , but in fact , the first non - European to be a Nobel Laureate in literature . 
This was only possible due to the great interest shown by the Swedish Society in the literary works of Tagore as early as 1911 . 
Prince William of Sörmland visited Kolkata around the same time and wrote about his experiences in Kolkata and the Tagore family in his book entitled " Där solen lyser” ( There the sun shines ) . 
Gurudev Tagore visited Sweden in 1921 and 1926 . 
These were probably the first recorded visits of an eminent Indian dignitary to Sweden . He was greeted , among others , by His Majesty the King Gustav V . 
I am honoured to continue the tradition and would like to invite Your Majesties to visit India again - at a time of your convenience . 
It would be a great pleasure and privilege to receive you in New Delhi . 
In conclusion , I would like to recall the apt words of Ms . Selma Lagerlof , the first ever women Nobel Laureate in literature , who was a contemporary of Gurudev Tagore and I quote : " No one is able to enjoy such feast than the one who throws a party in his own mind”
I would like to congratulate the people of Sweden for their creativity and their ingenious innovations and thank them for giving to the world some of the most important and life - changing inventions . 
I take this opportunity to convey the best wishes of the Government and the people of India to the people of Sweden as you celebrate your National Day on the 6th of June . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , I invite you to please join me in raising a toast : 
- - To the health of Their Majesties , the King and Queen of Sweden
- - To the continued progress and prosperity of the people of Sweden and India
- - To the enduring friendly relations between India and Sweden . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE LAUNCH OF WI - FI FACILITY IN THE PRESIDENT’S ESTATE
I am happy to join the residents of the President’s Estate on a momentous occasion , which is the launch of Wi - Fi services . 
At the outset , let me congratulate the President’s Secretariat team ably led by Smt . Omita Paul , and also the Team - NIC , for conceptualizing and implementing this unique project . 
Information is power . 
But unfortunately , as borne out till this day , access of information to the people at the bottom of the socio - economic pyramid is either unavailable or at best limited . 
This deficit createshaves and have - nots in the society and translates into social inequality . 
Without bridging the information gap , such disparity will persist . 
Of course , thanks to modern communication system , the asymmetry in information access is slowly getting eroded . 
The government launches many programmes for the benefit of the common man . 
Substantial investment in terms of money and effort go into making policies , schemes and programmes aimed at eradication of poverty and other socio - economic ills . 
Yet , in the absence or poor presence of an effective communication strategy , a large segment of the intended beneficiary population remains unaware of the various benefits they are entitled to . 
Many a times , it becomes difficult to ensure that the government policies and programmes reach the general population in various parts of the country . 
In this context , the idea of bringing information to the doorsteps of citizens through network is a revolutionary step to transform India to a Digital India . 
Technology has an innate capacity to change lives of the people by ushering in greater convenience and physical well - being . 
Relatively weak countries have experienced revolutionary changes and become emerging economies in a matter of one or two generations ; all due to the effect of greater technological application . 
Technology - led economic growth makes transformational changes possible . 
Technology is usually considered a logical extension of knowledge gained from science . 
But , to my mind , it is much more than mere application of science . Technology is contextual . 
There is an economic value to technology . 
In the past two decades , we are witness to the radical change brought about by mobile telephony and internet . 
India too experienced a socio - economic upheaval brought about by these two path - breaking innovations . 
India , with 960 million mobile phones today , stands second in the world behind China . 
We have more than 77 mobile phone connections per 100 citizens , which is commendable in terms of the penetration achieved by us in mobile telephony . 
The other marvel of technology – internet - has become a critical source of information and communication round the globe . 
India , with 244 million , ranks third after China and USA in terms of number of internet users . 
However , the penetration of internet use as a percentage of the population is only twenty , indicating not only a huge gap but a significant potential for future growth as well . 
Internet is a powerful tool of connectivity which can bring socio - economic transformation through access to information and services . 
The leveraging capacity for Information and Communication Technology to boost competitiveness and well - being stands as an important indicator of how effectively we are able to deploy technology for people and society . 
According to the Global Information Technology Report 2015 released by the World Economic Forum , India is at the 89th position in Network Readiness Index . 
Countries like Singapore , Finland and Sweden are leaders in this Index . 
We have some distance to cover in order to ensure that infrastructure for Internet and ICT - enabled services is available all over the country and used widely in a systematic manner . 
One of the key steps in this endeavour could be to roll out Wi - Fi services in public places across the country , both in urban and rural India . 
I am glad that in the President’s Estate which has a population base of about five thousand , we have moved a step forward in this direction . 
With each resident having an access to the Wi - Fi network now , they will be conveniently disposed to seek information and database and ‘virtually’ connect with the world outside . 
I hope this will be a crucial step in breaking the hierarchy in access to information of public databases and services . 
In the end , I call upon my Secretariat to further leverage the strength of ICT for the residents and working population , and make this a model for other government townships . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE SPECIAL SESSION OF THE UTTARAKHAND LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
It is indeed a privilege for me to be present amidst you to attend the Special Session of the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly in this beautiful capital city of Dehradun . 
I thank Shri Govind Kunjawal , Honourable Speaker , Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly for his kind invitation to be amidst you today . 
Uttarakhand has been described as ‘Dev Bhoomi’ or the Abode of Gods . Nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas , it is home to snow capped mountains and glaciers as well as the holiest of rivers , the Ganga and Yamuna . 
Further , the simplicity , warmth and hospitality of the people of this state is well known across the country . 
Uttarakhand shares international boundaries with two of India’s most important neighbours . 
On your north - east is China while in the south–east is Nepal . 
Recently , tragedy struck Nepal in the form of a series of earthquakes leading to large scale devastation and loss of human lives . 
I take this occasion to extend my deepest condolences to the families of our brothers and sisters in Nepal who have lost their lives in this tragedy . 
The Government of India is extending all possible help and support and we have assured the Government and people of Nepal that we are with them in their hour of need . 
The mountains of Uttarakhand are believed to be the chosen residence of the Gods . 
It is said the great Rishi Ved Vyasa wrote the Mahabharata here and Guru Dronacharya had his ashram near Dehradun . 
The Pandavas are believed to have stopped by Uttarakhand on their final journey . 
Jagat Guru Adi Shankaracharaya visited Kedar Nath in 8th Century and according to some , attained nirvana here . 
The famous Advait Ashram established by Swami Vivekananda is situated at Mayawati in Champawat district of the State . 
Some of the most sacred places of India are located in Uttarakhand . 
The Chardham Yatra encompassing Yamunotri , Gangotri , Kedarnath and Badrinath occupies a cherished place in the heart of most Indians . 
Haridwar draws people from all over the world who come to take a holy dip at Har ki Pauri . 
The state is also home to Shri Hemkunt Sahib and Piran Kaliyar which are visited by people in large numbers from India and abroad . 
One of the routes for the famous Kailash Mansarovar Yatra also passes through Uttarakhand . 
I compliment all of you for the efforts made to rebuild the state after the natural disaster of 2013 . 
It is reassuring to know that the Char Dham Yatra has begun on time this year and is attracting people in large numbers . 
I am also happy that the Assembly has been united in its deliberations on how to face extraordinary situations like natural disasters . 
Born in the year 2000 , Uttarakhand has made significant progress since it became the 27th State of the Indian Union . 
Uttarakhand has been a leader in efforts for sustainable development . 
The country’s first effort at conservation of forests , the Corbett Park came up in 1936 in this region . 
It was the first Park of its kind , not only in the country , but in the whole of Asia . 
The world famous ‘Chipko Movement’ was launched by Gaura Devi , a simple village woman from the remote village of Raini in district Chamoli . 
It subsequently gained momentum under the leadership of Shri Sunderlal Bahuguna and other environmentalists . 
The 12000 Van Panchayats which manage a sizeable portion of the State’s forests through community participation are an institution unique in the country . 
Uttarakhand also has the distinction of increasing its forest cover by more than 1100 sq . km . during the first 10 years of its existence . 
Uttarakhand has successfully brought down the percentage of people living below the poverty line from 32 . 7 % in 2004 - 05 to 11 . 3 % in 2012 . 
99 per cent of the villages have been electrified in the State . 
Uttarakhand has registered an annual growth rate of about 10 % . 
However , this growth has not been uniform and I believe hill areas lag behind . 
I am happy to know that the State intends to make Gairsain in Chamoli district the summer capital of the State and construction of a new Vidhan Sabha Bhavan has started . 
The measures taken by the State Government to improve governance such as e - Treasury , computerization of land records , online delivery of public services , online grievance redressal mechanism etc . will surely be welcomed by the people . 
I also appreciate the green initiatives and process automation undertaken by this Assembly to move towards a paperless Legislature . 
I congratulate the people of Uttarakhand who have participated actively in the democratic process overcoming physical and geographical barriers such as hilly and forest terrain . 
The voting percentage in the Assembly elections has steadily increased from 54 . 34 % in the Assembly Elections of 2002 to 67 . 22 % in the 2012 elections . 
Moreover , all three elections witnessed a change in treasury benches . 
The hallmark of a vibrant democracy is that the ballot forms the basis of transition of power . 
The founding fathers of our Republic were convinced that the Parliamentary system was best suited to our ethos and genius . 
Dr . Ambedkar , the Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee said : 
Under the non - parliamentary system , such as the one that exists in the U . S . A . , the assessment of the responsibility of the Executive is periodic . It is done by the Electorate . 
In England , where the Parliamentary system prevails , the assessment of responsibility of the Executive is both daily and periodic . 
The daily assessment is done by members of Parliament ( in your case , the Legislative Assembly ) through Questions , Resolutions , No - confidence motions , Adjournment motions and Debates on Addresses . 
Periodic assessment is done by the Electorate at the time of the election which may take place every five years or earlier . 
The daily assessment of responsibility , which is not available under the American system , is , it is felt , far more effective than the periodic assessment and far more necessary in a country like India . 
The Draft Constitution in recommending the Parliamentary system of Executive has preferred more responsibility to more stability . 
Governing a country of the size and diversity of India and managing challenges that arise on account of region , language , ethnicity , caste and religion is a stupendous task . 
Yet , the Parliamentary system has taken deep roots in our soil and we have successfully conducted sixteen General Elections to the Lower House of Parliament as well as innumerable elections to our State Legislatures and local bodies . 
Our Parliamentary democracy today evokes awe and admiration across the world . 
The Constitution of India places the Legislative Assembly at the centre of governance in a State and conceives of it as the primary instrument of good governance and socio - economic transformation . 
The job of a legislator is a 24x7 responsibility . 
Legislators must at all times be committed to addressing the problems of the people . 
They must give voice to the grievances of the public by raising them on the floor of the Legislature and act as the link between people and the Government . 
They must always keep in mind that young and aspirational Indians expect them to be service providers . 
They will demand an account of how they have performed at the end of five years . 
Every one of us who are in an elected office must remember that the people are our masters . 
Each one of us is here because we solicited votes and received their endorsement . 
The cardinal principle of effective functioning of the Parliamentary system is that majority will rule and minority will oppose , expose and if possible , depose . 
However , minority must accept the decisions of the majority while the majority must respect the views of the minority . 
In the Assembly , discipline and decorum must be always maintained and rules , conventions and etiquette observed . 
Parliamentary practices , procedures and conventions are meant to provide for orderly and expeditious transaction of business of the House . 
Dissent should be expressed with decency and within the contours and parameters of Parliamentary devices . 
Democracy should comprise of the three ‘D’s - Debate , Dissent and Decision not the fourth ‘D’ ‘Disruption’ . 
It is unfortunate that time devoted by legislators towards legislation has been gradually declining across the country . 
The Presiding Officers Conferences have time and again reiterated the need for holding a minimum of 100 days of sittings every year . 
With the heightened complexity of administration , legislation must be preceded by adequate discussion and scrutiny . 
If not , it will fail to deliver the desired results or meet its objectives . 
In particular , there is need for utmost caution in matters of legislation , money and finance . 
It must be kept in mind that no expenditure can be incurred by the Executive , no tax levied and no money withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of the State without the approval of the Legislature . 
It is a matter of satisfaction that the current Sixteenth Lok Sabha has assumed its role and responsibilities in right earnest . 
Until now , the 16th Lok Sabha has sat for 90 days and passed 55 Government bills . 
24 bills were passed in the just concluded fourth session . 
Further , the House sat late for 55 hours and 19 minutes in the fourth session to transact urgent government business . 
7 hours and 04 minutes were sadly lost due to interruptions and forced adjournments . 
Thankfully , this is less than in many previous sessions . 
Let me add that a noteworthy feature of this Lok Sabha is that there are 318 first timers and the time spent on quality debate and discussion has gone up considerably . 
I am particularly happy the Constitution Amendment Bill relating to Land Boundary Agreement between India and Bangladesh was passed unanimously by both Houses of Parliament . 
The unanimous vote on the Bill has conveyed a strong message of friendship to Bangladesh and established to the world that India stands united on matters of great national importance . 
I urge the Uttarakhand Assembly as well as other Assemblies to consider increasing the number of sittings so that issues of the state can be thoroughly discussed and debated . 
In order to bring people closer to the Legislatures , I suggest that our Legislative Assemblies establish museums for the public on legislative practices . 
They could also invite students to witness sessions and organize capacity building programmes for members of local bodies such as Gram Sabhas and Panchayats . 
Every legislator should ensure that the content and quality of debates that take place in the chambers are of the highest order . 
As members of different political Parties , individual Legislators would be guided by the policies of their respective Parties . 
However , issues of development and public welfare transcend political barriers . 
It should not be difficult to forge consensus on such issues . 
In a parliamentary democracy , the oversight function of the Legislature is important and dynamic . 
Legislative oversight is a continuous process carried out in the Committees as well as the floor of the House . 
Legislators involvement in Committees such as Public Accounts Committee , Estimates Committee and the Departmental Standing Committees can help them develop expertise in the complex working of government departments . 
The Question Hour provides a good opportunity to ask searching questions and hold the Executive accountable for its actions or inaction and to obtain assurances from the Ministries concerned . 
This is one of the important privileges of legislators and they must ensure that the Question Hour is fully utilized . 
Let me narrate an anecdote to reinforce this point . 
Shri S . Satyamurti , a lawyer and outstanding orator , entered the Madras Legislative Council in 1923 and his fame as a legislator rapidly spread all over the country . 
He excelled himself in the Question Hour and became a master of the art of interpellation . 
He was known as the ‘terror of the question hour’ . 
His brilliant and effective speeches earned him the name " Trumpet Voice” . 
When the time came for elections to the Madras Legislative Council , Gandhiji declared it was enough if one Satyamurti was sent to the Legislatures . 
Shri Satyamurti’s success as a member of the Central Legislative Assembly from 1935 to 1939 led Gandhiji to remark that if there had been ten Satyamurtis in our legislatures , the British would have quit long ago . 
I visited the beautiful state of Arunachal Pradesh in November 2013 and I was told that leaders of traditional tribal councils of the state calledKebang andBuliangrecite a passage at the beginning of their meeting –
" Villagers and brethren , let us strengthen our custom and our council , let us improve our relations , let us make the laws straight and equal for all , let our laws be uniform , let our customs be the same for all , let us be guided by reason and see that justice is done and compromise reached that is acceptable to both parties . 
Let us decide while the dispute is fresh , lest the small disputes grow big and continue for the long time . 
We have come together for a council meeting and let us speak in one voice and decide our verdict . 
So let us decide and mete out justice . 
Modern day legislators would do well to heed this sage advice of the tribal elders . 
The Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly has over the years promoted the welfare of the people of the State through numerous progressive enactments . 
The time has now come to show leadership in catapulting the state to new heights . 
Uttarakhand has all the resources required to develop as a major destination for tourism and an important centre for horticulture . 
Uttarakhand has been a traditional seat of learning . 
The Indian Military Academy , Forest Research Institute , Lal Bahadur Shastri National Administration Academy , Wildlife Institute of India , Indian Institute of Petroleum and Govind Vallabh Pant Agriculture University are already located here . 
There is great scope for the state to emerge as an education , sports and IT hub of the country . 
Education is the mantra that can transform our nation . 
I call upon each one of you to personally supervise the state of schools and colleges in your constituencies and ensure that students go to school , teachers teach and the best of education is provided . 
All of you are aware of the Namami Gange programme and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan . 
This state which is home to the holy rivers , a major destination for pilgrims and important centre of education must ensure the success of these programmes . 
Take upon yourself the goal of a Clean Ganga and Clean India ! 
The Gods have blessed your state and people with a wealth of beauty . 
I am confident your hard work , strong determination and conviction will result in happy and prosperous life for each and every citizen of the state . 
Let me conclude with a few lines from the renowned poet of Uttarakhand , Shri Sumitranandan Pant
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF THE PRESENTATION OF NATIONAL FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE AWARDS FOR NURSING PERSONNEL
It gives me great pleasure to greet you all on International Nurses’ Day . 
I would like to offer my felicitations to the men and women of the nursing fraternity in India . 
You are serving , with professionalism and courage , your fellow citizens in all regions of our country . 
It is your efforts that are vital in bringing healthcare and health services to our diverse regions . 
Your commitment and patience is at the forefront of polio eradication , mid - wife services and even educating communities as you work for their optimal health and improved quality of life . 
On this day , we celebrate your contribution by recognizing the 35 outstanding men and women among you who have distinguished themselves by their extraordinary services in the field of nursing . 
The conferment of the National Florence Nightingale Awards for 2015 under the different categories , is therefore , a fitting tribute to the iconic ‘Lady with the Lamp’ . 
Her foundational efforts were the inspiration and basis for the development of professional nursing and modern healthcare . 
I am glad to see the theme selected by the International Council of Nurses for the year , 2015 : " Nurses : A Force for Change : Care Effective , Cost Effective . ”
This is particularly apt on two levels : at the global level , 2015 is a milestone year for the finalization of the post - 2015 agenda of the Millennium Development Goals . 
In this context , the input and partnership of nurses , the world over , is essential for the success of Governments and non - Governmental organisations in achieving their objectives of effective care and cost efficient solutions in the field of health . 
At the national level , the nursing workforce in India is a valuable instrument of change . 
It is well known that nurses are the largest workforce in the healthcare industry in India . 
If they are properly trained and strategically positioned , they can help develop quality health care , strengthen healthcare systems and work effectively in interdisciplinary teams . 
They have an important contribution to make in planning and decision - making for the development of an appropriate and effective health policy for India , improving efficiency in public health programmes and reducing cost and wastage . 
Nursing services and training facilities in India have expanded significantly since our independence . 
Today , I understand , the strength of the nursing sector in our country is about 26 lakhs . 90 % of them are in hospitals and public health programmes . 
As first line health - care providers , they are active in all parts of India . 
At the village level , they are effectively delivering healthcare at the very door step of our people – urban as well as remote rural communities . 
I am happy that Government of India has taken several initiatives for the further development of pre - service and in - service training and education for the development , upgradation and strengthening of nursing services in India . 
These are important measures : we must keep in mind that the ratio of nurses in India , at the current level of 1 . 25 nurses per 1000 persons – is well below the world average of three per thousand . 
In some developed countries the ratio is actually much higher , varying from 9 - 12 nurses per 1000 persons . 
It is heartening to note that the total number of nursing institutions - providing training in Auxiliary Nursing and Midwifery , General Nursing and Midwifery and B Sc programmes in Nursing - has increased from about 1700 in 2005 to more than 6500 in 2014 . 
During the same period , the total number of nursing personnel in these two categories registered with the Indian Nursing Council increased from 13 . 89 lakhs to 25 . 52 lakhs . 
To provide subsidized education in this area , Government has started schools for training in Auxiliary as well as General Nursing and Midwifery in 269 locations across the country . 
We need to continue to maintain this momentum to ensure that the requirement of nursing personnel in our country is adequately catered for . 
There is also a need for greater focus on education and training of the nursing personnel . 
Under the 12th Five Year Plan , a budget of Rs . 2 , 150 crores has been allocated to the programmes and schemes for the improvement of nursing services in India . 
For the improved implementation of these initiatives , new technologies are being made available and applied for monitoring their progress . 
I am confident that the new measures that have been taken will go a long way in achieving the desired results . 
H’ble Minister for Health , Ladies and gentlemen , 
I do believe that India’s nursing fraternity – both in the Government as well as the private sector , have earned tremendous admiration and respect wherever they have served - and continue to serve – because of their uncommon devotion and dedication to their calling . 
As a key constituent of the workforce of our country , they are an invaluable asset . 
While serving in challenging conditions abroad , they have brought credit to our nation and contributed significantly through their remittances . 
Through their disciplined attitude and high level of proficiency , they have earned tremendous goodwill in all parts of the world . 
As we recognize and honor , on this day , the noble contribution of the nursing community of India , I wish them every success . 
May they grow from strength to strength as they serve their country and people . 
The nation is grateful for their gift of service and compassion . 
I once again congratulate the H’ble Health Minister and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for their efforts towards the growth and advancement of the nursing community in India . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE MEETING OF INDIAN AND RUSSIAN UNIVERSITIES
I am happy to be amidst a group of academicians representing some of the best educational institutions in India and Russia . 
In the present - day knowledge societies , where innovation is at the core of growth , progress and prosperity , educational and research institutions play a critical role . 
Each of your institutions is a key participant in the national development of India and Russia . 
Russia’s educational institutions have a great legacy of accomplishment . 
As far back as 1930 , during his visit to the Soviet Union , Rabindranath Tagore had described your universities as " miracles in the realm of education” . 
It is this educational system that has led to Russia’s enviable success as a nation of learning . 
It has enabled Russia’s technological achievements in areas such as material sciences , aerospace , nuclear science , petrochemicals , mining and heavy engineering . 
This hallowed institution where we stand now – the Moscow State University – has produced 17 Nobel Prize and Fields Medal laureates in the last sixty years . 
India today seeks to accelerate her economic growth and development through a strong emphasis on technology and innovation . 
Our educational and research institutions are making vigorous efforts to rise to these ambitious national goals and the aspirations of our people . 
This includes a significant expansion in the reach of quality education , up - scaling our research capacities , and linking more closely research output to industrial needs . 
Research is the cornerstone of academic endeavour . 
Its quality determines the academic calibre of an educational institution . 
Indeed , without strong research programmes , no institution of higher education can truly accomplish its central mandate of promoting learning and knowledge . 
It is , thus , imperative that all educational institutions place research at the core of their future plans and activities . 
India and Russia have benefited from bilateral programmes of scientific cooperation . 
These include our Integrated Long Term Programme dating back to 1987 , the establishment of joint centres of excellence as well as mutual research support programmes . 
In recent years , India and Russia have launched new cooperation programmes in areas such as basic sciences and health research . 
I am glad that our Department of Science & Technology and Russian Science Foundation have finalized a cooperation agreement which will offer another platform for supporting joint research projects . 
India and Russia have a long history of educational cooperation . 
In the late 1950s , the Soviet Union supported the Indian Institute of Technology , Bombay in its formative years . 
Tens of thousands of Indian students studied in Russia in the 1970s , 80s and 90s . 
Though the numbers have dropped somewhat in recent years , even now , over four thousand Indian students study at Russian universities . 
Some of our institutions have active programmes of cooperation - exchange of students , researchers and faculty members , and sharing of research publications . 
Notwithstanding this , there is a need for a broader and institutionalized engagement between our educational institutions . 
At the last Summit meeting between India and Russia in December 2014 , the two countries had decided to support a network of partnerships between our universities . 
I am glad that over recent months , many of you have been involved with your counterparts in identifying opportunities for cooperation and are ready to formalize arrangements for systematic cooperation in the future . 
The establishment of a Network of Indian and Russian Universities would facilitate establishment of more institutional linkages , including exchanges of faculty , researchers and students , joint research activities and scientific conferences and symposia . 
I extend my best wishes for fruitful cooperation in the Network . 
KEYNOTE ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE RUSSIAN DIPLOMATIC ACADEMY
It is my privilege to be here today at the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs . 
At the outset , I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Academy for honouring me by conferring an Honorary Doctorate . 
A matter of pride as it is for me , I see this as a manifestation of the enduring affection that the Russian people have for India . 
At the same time , it also reflects the depth and resilience of the relationship between our two countries , which I have experienced personally in my many decades of public life . 
The Russian Diplomatic Academy was established in 1934 . 
Since then , it has made a stellar contribution to Russian diplomacy in its role as the principal training institute for serving and aspiring Russian diplomats . 
This prestigious institution represents the finest ideals of humanity by training practitioners in the art of negotiations and preparing them to find diplomatic solutions to the challenges of peace and development . 
Active interactions with similar institutions in other countries have made this Academy an agent of diplomacy itself . 
I am in Moscow for the Commemoration of the 70th Anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War . 
The crucial role played by Russia and the sacrifices made by the Russian people during that historic period are well - known and widely recognized . 
I would like to convey warm felicitations to the Russian people on this historic occasion . 
Indians too made significant sacrifices during the War . 
In fact , our nations are united by our suffering and sacrifices in the fight against the forces of Fascism and Nazism . 
It is , thus , entirely appropriate that we today cherish and celebrate our shared victory . 
Formal diplomatic ties between India and Russia have a relatively short history of 68 years . 
Even then , numerous threads have linked our peoples and civilizations over the centuries . 
Afanasy Nikitin journeyed from Tver , near Moscow , to India in 1469 almost three decades before the Portuguese Vasco da Gama reached Kozhikode . 
His travelogue about his experiences in India , " Journey Beyond the Three Seas " , is still read with interest in Russia and India . 
As early as 1615 onwards , merchants from Gujarat reached Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga River where a thriving Indian community flourished till the middle of the nineteenth century . 
They were extremely well regarded by the Tsar in Moscow , to whom they supplied fine textiles . 
It is said that the Indian traders introduced a textile industry in the Russian capital in the middle of the seventeenth century . 
Our two countries also share a robust tradition of intellectual , literary and philosophical inquiry . 
The Indologist , Gerasim Lebedev , was a pioneer of Bengali theatre in Calcutta in the late eighteenth century . 
Leo Tolstoy was fascinated by Hindu and Buddhist scriptures . 
He was familiar with the thinking of Sri Ramakrishna and was impressed by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda . 
On the other hand , Mahatma Gandhi was deeply influenced by Tolstoy ' s thoughts about non - violent resistance and the renunciation of force as a means of opposition . 
The artist and philosopher , Nicholas Roerich , came to India in 1923 . 
With his wife Elena , he founded the Urusvati Institute of Himalayan Studies in 1928 . 
He lived near Kullu , Himachal Pradesh , till his death in 1947 . 
It gives me great pleasure to join youon the occasion ofthe 62nd National Film Awards function . 
The National Film Awards stands for immense honour befitting the highest governmental recognition in the field of cinema . 
I welcome and congratulate all the recipients of the 62nd National Awards . 
You have done India proud and placed our cinema yet again on the global radar . 
I also compliment the Chairpersons and Members of the Jury for a job well done . 
My special congratulations to Shri Shashi Kapoor who has been honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award this year . 
His contribution to cinema has been manifold and tremendous . 
He is a true living legend . 
Shri Kapoor began his career as a child artist in the films Aag and Awara , and then we saw him as a flamboyant hero in many blockbuster films . 
He made his mark not only as an actor but also as a producer with remarkable contributions to Indian Cinema even while he expertly balanced two lives in theatre and cinema . 
Shri Shashi Kapoor is the third person to win the Dadasaheb Phalke Award from his illustrious family , the others being – Shri Prithviraj Kapoor and Shri Raj Kapoor . 
My compliments to the entire family which has given so much to Indian cinema . 
I wish Shri Shashi Kapoor a long and healthy life . 
Cinema has been an integral part of Indian culture and entertainment from the days of Dadasaheb Phalke’sRaja Harish Chandra of 1913 , the first film made in India . 
Indian cinema transcends national boundaries and is a powerful purveyor of ideas and values that impact the consciousness of millions of people . 
Our movies not only showcase the multicultural diversity of our country but is also a tribute to our linguistic richness . 
They are a national treasure and our country’s " soft power” in the true sense of the term , forging international ties and navigating global horizons with ease . 
The Indian film industry is today the largest film industry in the world in terms of number of movies being produced . 
With about 1600 films made every year , the film industry is today a force to reckon with , having a turnover of a magnitude of Rs . One Lakh Two Thousand Six Hundred crores or US $ 16 . 14 billion . 
With the world’s youngest demography and the growing smartphone market , our country is likely to soon embrace a completely digital ecosystem which would help us connect with even larger numbers transcending geographical and cultural barriers . 
Digitization of film screens have allowed distributors to release films simultaneously across multiple screens which allows 60 to 80 per cent of theatrical revenues to be collected in the first week itself , something which was unheard of in the past . 
We need to reinforce this trend by ensuring the building of more screens for the overall health of our cinema . 
By now mainstream Hindi cinema is internationally recognized . 
We must also make focused efforts to project our regional films whose numbers as well as content are equally impressive and deserve global attention . 
We live in a rapidly changing world to which the film industry will have to adjust and adapt . 
Technology has brought down the costs of production and expanded the mechanisms of dissemination . 
Still cameras and cell phones that record video can be now edited on a home computer and uploaded on the net . 
Promotion and marketing of films have now taken on a new avatar with substantial marketing happening on social media – news of a good film now spreads quicker on twitter than by word of mouth . 
I also understand 2014 saw the launch of four film and entertainment focussed investment funds which is welcome evidence of the growing corporatisation of the sector . 
Cinema in India crosses all boundaries of region , caste , creed and religion . 
It reflects the immense diversity of our nation which is home to different cultures , religions and languages . 
It shows the confluence of modernity and tradition as well as our ancient past and billion aspirations for the future . 
Digitization and the advent of modern technologies do not mean that we lose touch with the grass roots . 
Our content has to be our strength as it is entrenched deeply in our vibrant cultural milieu . 
Today’s Awards are testimony to the fact that Indian cinema continues to brim and overflow with amazing talent . 
I am told that this year yet again the youth have made their mark . 
The winner of the Best Film Award , Chaitanya Tamhane is only 27 years old . 
His film " Court” has already created waves in the International Film Festivals . 
I am also delighted that the winner of the Best Female Playback Singer this year is young Uthara , who is all of ten years old . 
The flowering of creativity amongst our youth holds tremendous promise for the future . 
It reassures us that we will continue to lead the world not just in number of films produced but also in the quality of our cinema and the top class talent in our industry . 
The Government of India is taking a number of steps for strengthening and promoting Indian cinema and the film industry . 
The Government is planning to set up a National Centre of Excellence for Animation , Gaming , and Visual Effects . 
A National Film Heritage Mission is to be undertaken by the National Film Archives of India for conservation / preservation , restoration and digitization of films made in the country . 
The Government also proposes to set up a Film Facilitation Unit which will act as a facilitation point for filmmakers and production houses from foreign countries to enable them come to India and shoot their films in India . 
I am confident these measures will provide significant impetus to the growth of our film industry . 
Rabindranath Tagore ' s poetry , which made a passionate plea for universal peace , love and harmony , was widely admired both in Tsarist and post - revolutionary Russia . 
Several Russian translations of Tagore ' sGitanjali were brought out soon after its release in 1913 . 
Tagore predicted that Russia would be victorious against the fascists , foreseeing the heroism of the Russian people . 
It is noteworthy that India established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union as early as April 13 , 1947 , over four months before India became independent . 
Since then , India and Russia have built a durable and multi - faceted partnership . 
The Bulganin - Khrushchev visit to India in November 1955 heralded a new era in bilateral ties . 
The emergence of military - technical cooperation in the 1960s , and the Indo - Soviet Treaty of Peace , Friendship and Cooperation in August 1971 , were major milestones in our relationship . 
The launch of India ' s first satellite Aryabhatta in 1975 by a Soviet launch vehicle and of the first Indian in space - Rakesh Sharma - in a Soviet spacecraft in 1984 underlined our close cooperation in space . 
It was this powerful legacy of mutually - beneficial cooperation cutting across varied sectors that enabled our two nations to swiftly overcome the difficulties posed by wide - ranging changes of the early 1990s . 
It is no exaggeration to state that our unique and multi - dimensional ties have proved their resilience . India and Russia today enjoy what we have termed a ' special and privileged strategic partnership ' , based on unmatched mutual confidence , trust and goodwill . 
. Our Annual Summits are at the apex of an elaborate multi - layered mechanism for bilateral interaction , more detailed than India has with any country in the world . 
It has helped deepen and diversify our bilateral relationship over the past 15 years and evolve common approaches to major regional and international issues . 
At the last India - Russia Annual Summit on 11 December 2014 , our two countries agreed on a strategic vision to further strengthen and diversify cooperation in the years ahead . 
India values her close and extensive cooperation with Russia in defence , nuclear energy and security . 
Russia is and will remain our most important defence partner . 
It is also a key partner for our energy security , building on its leading role in the development of nuclear power generation in India . 
There are evidentcomplementarities that underlie our cooperation in hydrocarbons . 
Russia is one of the world ' s largest oil and gas producers while India is one of the largest consumers . 
India ' s largest investment in Russia is in the oil and gas sector . 
This can increase significantly and emerge as the driver of a resurgent economic partnership . 
Both countries are committed to do so . 
In this 40th anniversary of the launch of Aryabhatta , we have agreed to re - invigorate our cooperation in space . 
We have an extensive inter - governmental scientific collaboration programme . 
Joint centres of excellence have been set up to promote research in areas as diverse as powder metallurgy , vaccine development , super - computing , bio - technology , bio - medicine , gas hydrate studies , and earthquake research , to name a few . 
We are also looking at intensifying cooperation in innovation - driven projects in high technology areas . 
During President Putin ' s visit to India in December 2014 , we jointly agreed to the need to move our trade and economic ties to a higher level . 
We must build on synergies in areas such as engineering , pharmaceuticals , chemicals , fertilizers , coal , diamonds , metallurgy , civil aircraft , automobiles , and information and communication technology . 
Concerted and joint efforts will be needed to overcome structural and other impediments to India - Russia trade and economic collaboration . 
Indian businesses need to reach out to Russia ' s regions and be more responsive to business opportunities in Russia . 
Russian companies need to do the same . 
We need to comprehend each other ' s achievements and capabilities , and recognize the huge opportunities for investment and technological tie - ups in our dynamic markets . 
Cultural and people - to - people ties bind us closely . 
We appreciate the warmth and openness with which Indian culture , philosophy and cinema are received in Russia . 
The exchanges between our Universities , institutes of higher learning , scholars , artists and intellectuals are of the highest significance and must be encouraged . 
A Festival of Russian Culture was celebrated in India last year . 
The Year of Indian Culture " Namaste Russia " is being celebrated in Russia this year . 
Tourism between India and Russia has grown significantly in recent years and can develop further . 
The world of today is equally one of unprecedented opportunities and grave challenges . 
Even as living standards and technological capabilities improve with each passing day , we are also witness to a re - emergence of conflict and serious economic and ecological crises in different parts of the world . 
Terrorism and extremism emanating from our shared neighbourhood remains a major security threat for India and Russia . 
Dealing with this challenge requires not only a strong commitment by our two countries but also cooperation among the international community . 
Indeed , the international community requires cooperative and representative structures more than ever before . 
Though the world has become increasingly multi - polar and emerging economies have grown in strength , this is not fully reflected in international institutions and decision - making processes . 
Cooperation between India and Russia in multilateral fora , including G20 and BRICS is thus of great importance . 
We congratulate Russia on its Presidency of two important fora - BRICS and Shanghai Cooperation Organization - this year . 
We will work closely with our Russian friends to enhance multi - sectoral cooperation within these fora . 
We appreciate Russia ' s support for India ' s permanent membership of UN Security Council and membership of the multi - lateral export control regimes . 
We applaud Russia ' s efforts to promote a political settlement in Syria and its contribution towards a peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue . 
India - Russia relations , shaped as they are by our respective historical experiences , cultural affinities , political convergences and economic opportunities , will not be affected by winds of transient global political trends . 
Russia has been a pillar of strength at difficult moments in India ' s history . 
You have contributed to India’s development , growth and security . 
India will always reciprocate this support . 
Across Indian society and the spectrum of its political structures , there is unanimity that friendship with Russia is an important pillar of India ' s foreign policy . 
Let me also take this opportunity to emphasize that the dynamic development of our strategic partnership owes a great deal to the vision and leadership of President Vladimir Putin . 
His personal commitment has led us to new heights in our relations . 
We recognize President Putin as a great friend of India . 
I look forward to renewing my association with him on this visit . 
Once again , I thank you and the members of this great institution for the honour you have bestowed on me today . 
I also wish to thank you for this unique opportunity to share my thoughts with you . 
Over the years the national awards have stood for excellence in all aspects of cinema in various relevant categories recognising talent in feature , non - feature , regional , technical , parallel and popular genres . 
For those striving towards the pinnacle of success in celluloid , herein lies the greatest honour in this country . 
We must applaud the hard work and toil of all those who have been tireless in their efforts of achieving the end – which is to create a perfect work of art borne out by their creative imagination , technical prowess and knowledge of their field and choice of subject . 
In conclusion , I urge the film industry to look beyond markets and work together to help nurture universal human values that draw on our rich civilizational heritage that celebrates diversity and nurtures inclusiveness . 
We might remember here the iconic Ritwik Ghatak , a great filmmaker famously said ‘Cinema is no art for me . 
It is only a means to the end of serving my people’ . 
I take this opportunity to once again congratulate each one of the Award Winners and wish everyone of them as well as all from the film industry gathered here continued success in the pursuit of excellence . 
I am confident that your creativity will touch new heights in the years ahead and you will continue to provide the people of our nation and the world superior as well as value based entertainment . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE NATIONAL SUMMIT ON CSR ON THE THEME “PARTNERING THE NATIONAL AGENDA”
It is my privilege to join you for the inaugural session of this National Summit on Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) . 
At first , let me congratulate the Confederation of Indian Industry ( CII ) for organizing this annual conclave aimed at creating a strong , sustainable CSR movement in the country . 
I also compliment the National Foundation for Corporate Governance , with whom the CII has partnered for this 2015 edition of the Summit . 
The government has over the last few months articulated the key national priorities and programmes . 
It is , therefore , apt that this Summit has been convened at this time on the theme " Partnering the National Agenda” . 
I am glad to find many distinguished industry captains participating in this important event . 
You are leaders with sharp business acumen , valued experience and wide expertise . 
You are entrusted with the responsibility to manage the development of your business into models of excellence . 
Remember that this calls for not only sound application of management principles , but also better appreciation of the socio - economic reality in which your companies operate . 
You have a bigger purpose than to merely earn profits . 
Just as you add value to your shareholders’ wealth , it is equally important to add value to the society at large . 
You , as conscientious industry heads , would do well to build this emerging gospel of doing business into your corporate blueprint . 
The notion of CSR is not new to India . 
Mahatma Gandhi had espoused the socio - economic philosophy of trusteeship . 
It provided a means for wealthy people to be trustees to look after the welfare of the common man . 
CSR gradually evolved into the corporate framework . 
CSR refers to a company’s sense of responsibility extending beyond its shareholders to all stakeholders , notably the people and ecology who are in the domain of its operation . 
It indicates a sense of ‘corporate citizenship’ . 
Though a business entity incurs short - term costs without direct financial benefit , yet , it gains in the long run through the promotion of social and environmental change . 
Indian industry has displayed a keen interest in contributing to the betterment of the society . 
Shouldering the task of socio - economic development is increasingly considered a shared responsibility of the government and the industry . 
This CSR consciousness has received a renewed impetus through a legal framework in the Companies Act , 2013 . 
Section 135 of the Act prescribes every company eligible in terms of net worth , turnover or net profit to constitute a committee of the Board to formulate a policy for undertaking specified CSR activities . 
The Act also provides such companies to spend in a financial year at least two percent of the average net profits made by it during the three immediately preceding financial years . 
This legislation could help unlock a substantial amount - estimated to be in the range of Rs . 8 , 000 to 20 , 000 crore - for social sector engagement of Indian companies . 
A structured development strategy is now required to ensure that these funds are efficiently deployed in areas most beneficial to society . 
In a country as vast as India , scalability is critical to the success of programmes . 
Leading industry associations like CII must encourage pooling of funds by companies to create large high impact programmes . 
In this context , the Foundation set up by CII to reinforce the CSR initiatives of various businesses is commendable . 
Inclusive growth is an avowed objective of our public policy . 
It calls for intensive collaborative efforts of the government and the corporate sector to provide the basics for improving the quality of life in our rural and urban areas . 
The corporate sector must provide renewed impetus to CSR initiatives towards cleanliness , health and education . 
The Government has launched several important schemes in this direction . 
To mention a few - Swachh Bharat Mission aims at a Clean India by 2nd October , 2019 to coincide with the 150thBirth Anniversary of Gandhiji ; Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana envisages the integrated development of selected villages . 
The corporate sector can work at various models to develop a synergetic relationship in the implementation of these schemes . 
In the sphere of health and education , many companies have established reputed institutions . 
The private sector can extend the good work to rural areas by meeting the infrastructure requirements in government schools and investing in teacher up - skilling . 
Companies can adopt specific blocks or districts for such intervention . 
This can be synergized with efforts to tackle malaises like malnutrition and other health - related issues . 
It is heartening to note that CII through its member - companies has committed to build about 10 , 000 toilets in schools . 
This effort will not only help develop quality culture but also bring children , especially the girl child , to schools . 
A demographic transition is underway in India , with half our population of 125 crore under 25 years of age . 
In less than a decade , we will possess the largest working - age population in the world . 
India’s large , youthful population can become a dividend only if they are empowered and enabled to fulfill their potential . 
The onus is on us collectively to train and skill 50 crore youth by 2022 . 
I am confident that the industry will prove to be more - than - an - able partner in the efforts of the government . 
The corporate sector must also venture beyond the mandated CSR spend - to activities such as energy conservation ; environment protection ; and development of an innovative spirit among workers to foster productivity and industrial growth . 
To my mind , more than money , important socio - economic objectives need innovative ideas , technology and management for their speedy realization . 
The Indian industry must leverage its strengths and competencies , and lend its expertise in a wide array of programmes . 
Given the diversity and level of development in different parts of our country , CSR cannot be a one - size - fits - all approach . 
While developing programmes , industry leaders and CSR experts must look at issues that are relevant to different regions . 
At the same time , they must ensure that companies look across India and not concentrate on a few pockets . 
The industry must work closely with non - governmental organizations . 
They have the pulse of development needs at the grassroots and can provide last mile connectivity in the delivery of programmes . 
The corporate sector must also build a dedicated cadre of volunteers , who can bring individual energy and creativity for transformational change . 
The India @ 75 programme of CII was started with a vision to see India emerge as a world leader through economic strength , technological vitality and moral leadership by 2022 . 
It is a platform to bring together young entrepreneurs who want to make a difference to the country . 
CSR must become a critical component of this initiative . 
Disseminating information about the work done by companies is necessary to create a positive sentiment about CSR . 
Equally important is to sustain the work that a company has initiated in this area . 
I am told that the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs , Bombay Stock Exchange and CII have joined hands to develop the world ' s first CSR exchange . 
It will help the corporate sector to become socially responsible , connect with implementing partners , and comply with the new CSR requirements . I compliment you all for the same . 
I am sure this CSR Summit will generate many innovative ideas and methods towards building an inclusive , compassionate and responsive society in India . 
I look forward to receiving its outcomes and the work plan for the coming year . 
I wish the Summit great success . 
I also wish you all Godspeed in your endeavours . 
Let me conclude in the words of Mahatma Gandhi : 
" Man becomes great exactly in the degree in which he works for the welfare of his fellowmen” . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE BANQUET HOSTED IN THE HONOUR OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN , H . E . MR . MOHAMMAD ASHRAF GHANI
It is a great pleasure for me to welcome Your Excellency and the distinguished members of your delegation on your first State Visit to India . 
I am particularly delighted that you have honoured us by staying at the Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
Although you have travelled here in your previous capacities on a number of occasions , this is a special visit . 
This time , you are visiting India as a leader of the National Unity Government in Afghanistan , as President of a proud nation with whom India has a cherished history of profound cultural , religious and civilisational bonds . 
It has always been a matter of pride for us that India is Afghanistan’s first Strategic Partner . 
We are happy that our bilateral co - operation , rooted in the age - old bonds of friendship between our two peoples , has been so constructive and fruitful . 
We believe that the enduring trust and mutual understanding between India and Afghanistan goes beyond political and strategic considerations . 
Our shared history and geography are a compelling factor in nurturing our close ties . 
Because of this historical reality , there has been strong and sustained support in India for our engagement with Afghanistan in its post - conflict economic reconstruction effort . 
Over the last fourteen years , India and Afghanistan have effectively implemented a number of projects for the reconstruction of Afghanistan . 
In 2011 , our countries signed a Strategic Partnership Agreement to provide a carefully conceived architecture for our multi - faceted dialogue and collaboration . 
We are confident that over the next few years , Afghanistan will see a significant transformation across its sectors and in all areas of its social and economic advancement . We look forward to this with all sincerity . 
We consider it a privilege to share our capabilities and experience in nation - building and inclusive development with our Afghan brothers . 
We continue to be fully committed to this – and shall be happy to support their endeavours in every way that you may require . 
Our engagement with Afghanistan , Your Excellency , has neither an expiry date nor a timeline . 
As a friend and neighbour , India will always stand firmly beside Afghanistan . 
We remain deeply conscious that Afghanistan ' s unity , independence , security and stability are critical – not only for itself – but also for India and for peace and progress in our entire neighbourhood . 
To this end , our Strategic Partnership looks to strengthen and diversify our bilateral engagement in the coming years , including by forging a more robust trade and investment relationship between our private sectors . 
I am confident , Mr . President , that your interactions with our Government during this State Visit will give you a very clear perception of our purpose and commitment . 
With these words , Excellency , I once again welcome you to India and to the Rashtrapati Bhavan and wish you and your distinguished delegation a comfortable stay and a very successful visit . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , I invite you to please join me in raising a toast : 
- to the good health of His Excellency , the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan , 
- to peace in Afghanistan and the prosperity of its people and
- to the everlasting friendship and co - operation between India and Afghanistan . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE RELEASE OF THE COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP ON OLD SEMINARY , KOTTAYAM
It gave me great pleasure to release the postal stamp commemorating the 200 years of the " Old Seminary”in Kottayam . 
The seminary was set up by theMalankara Orthodox Church situated inKerala , a state known for the peaceful co - existence of different religions and communal harmony . 
The Seminary and the Orthodox Church too played their part in achieving the laudable goal which led to the state realizing the complete separation of spiritualism and communalism . 
For nearly 14 Centuries , the three major religions of Kerala , Hinduism , Christianity and Islam have existed in peace and harmony , respecting each other’s belief and cooperating to promote social welfare . 
In fact , Kerala was the first state in the country in which both Christianity and Islam took roots with people voluntarily choosing different religious beliefs . 
There is another significant feature of communal relations in Kerala . 
The absence of animosity between religions is considered tolerance . 
But this only means the absence of negativity . 
But in Kerala it has a different dimension . 
It is that the society has moved to a higher plane where religions have cooperated to promote other religions . 
It is this extraordinary feature of the society that led to the Hindu Kings of Kerala giving land to both Christians and Muslims to set up their places of worship . 
In fact , the land for initially setting up the Old Seminary and the first contributions for its development came from the coffers of the Travancore Ruler , Gowry Parvathi Bhai , Regent Queen . 
India’s tallest leaders like Dr . S . Radhakrishnan and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru acknowledged the long and glorious history of the Christian Church in Kerala , and lauded its religious tolerance and respect for other religions . 
Dr . Radhakrishnan noted that the Syrian Christians have only welcomed those who wanted to join the faith out of their own volition . 
Pandit Nehru recalled the fact that Christianity in India came in the 1st century itself even before Europe embraced it . 
It is significant that the St . Thomas or Malankara Christians in their 2000 years of existence has assimilated and in many cases retained some of the important social customs and rituals of the Hindus . 
An Orthodox Christian marriage ceremony incorporates many such Hindu customs for instance . 
The lighting of oil lamps in and around Churches , the raising of the flagstaff and flags during festivals and the custom of entering the Churches barefoot are all Hindu traditions that have become a part of the Church practice . 
These bear testimony to the sharing of traditions by both the religions . 
I have been given to understand that the Orthodox Church has made enduring contributions to the betterment of the life of the people of Kerala . 
If Kerala is the shining example of universal literacy , the role of the Church in spreading education cannot be ignored . 
One of the earliest contributions of the Christian Community is the setting up of a large chain of elementary Schools throughout Kerala , under the supervision of the Seminary and its leaders . 
The chain of elementary schools set up under the supervision of the Seminary was the first indigenous initiative towards universal literacy and education , which has today made Kerala the most literate state in the country . 
The charity and healthcare activities of the Syrian Church also originated in the Old Seminary under its leadership . 
It contributed to the improvement of the overall literacy in the state , created greater access to healthcare and empowerment of women leading to higher standards of living and quality of life in the state . 
This has resulted in Kerala having the lowest infant mortality , lowest birthrates , highest number of hospital beds per lakh population , best male to female population ratio and one of the highest life expectancy in the country . 
It is heartening to note that the example set by Christian Churches have been emulated by all religions and Communities . 
In the area of Human Development Index , Kerala has done remarkably well . 
The role of the Church in healthcare , Women’s empowerment and upliftment of the less privileged section of society are simply unparalleled . 
In many ways , the Old Seminary played a seminal role in the unique form of development of Kerala . 
The Seminary , on its part took upon itself the onerous task of overall development , education and welfare of the whole State instead of limiting its role to the narrow and limited task of teaching religious practices and liturgy to the clergy . 
It is inspiring to note that the benefits of all these humanitarian and charity work of the Seminary and the enlightened and progressive leadership were not confined to any particular religious group . 
It has benefitted all in the society , irrespective of religion , caste and creed . 
This has inspired the other communities to set up similar institutions all over Kerala . 
It is not without reason that the Seminary has to its credit several ‘firsts’ in the area of Human Development , apart from its contributions to the training and development of the clergy of the Church . 
I am informed that the ‘Cottayam College’ , which was co - located with the Seminary was the first English teaching institution in the State . 
The College taught , apart from Malayalam , Greek , Latin , Syriac , Hebrew and Sanskrit . 
The first printing press was also established in the premises and scholars of the Seminary took active part in unifying and standardizing the common Malayalam Script . 
Benjamin Bailey along with Hermann Gundert , were among the pioneers of the development of modern Malayalam language and script . 
To imagine that the first Malayalam Dictionary was developed and published by a Theological Seminary is a tribute to the commitment of the leaders of the Seminary and the Church itself to the overall development of Kerala . 
The credit of translating Bible into the first Indian language , Malayalam , also goes to the Seminary and College under the leadership of Benjamin Bayley . 
It is interesting to note that the Orthodox Theological Seminary continues the traditions of its predecessor to take active interest in developing nontraditional and liberal disciplines like Counseling , Devotional Music , Meditation and Fine Arts . 
I hope , in keeping with the great tradition of universal brotherhood , the portals of the Seminary would also accommodate centres for the study of comparative religions and Philosophy . 
I can say without hesitation that the Orthodox Church and its leaders trained in the great portals of the Old Seminary have not only made sterling contributions to the Human Development of the State but also worked hard to promote shining example of communal harmony and mutual respect among the members of different religions . 
This is in fact the true accomplishment of the old Hindu concept of " Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” – " The World is One Family” as envisaged in the ancient Hindu scripture , Mahopanishad . 
With these few words , I conclude hoping that the Church and the Seminary would continue with their good work for the society . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE FOURTH CONVOCATION OF INDIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT
It is indeed a proud privilege for me to be present amidst you today for the Fourth Annual Convocation of IIM Raipur to deliver the convocation address . 
Education enriches lives , advances thinking , propagates new thought and enhances human capacity . 
Given that knowledge will spur growth in the future , it is essential that we prepare a large pool of skilled and capable manpower who can drive rapid economic growth of our country and enable us to deal with poverty , deprivation and backwardness . 
Most prosperous nations and societies have built their economic success on the foundation of a sound education system and rich culture of research . 
Success in the 21st century will be increasingly dependent on innovation and the competitive use of knowledge . 
Keeping in mind the need to build a knowledge society , the Indian Institute of Management was set up in Raipur in 2010 . 
I am happy that IIM Raipur is relentlessly pursuing its objectives of excellence in teaching , learning and human resource development . 
I understand the new state - of - the art campus at Naya Raipur will provide amenities comparable to any world class institute . 
Setting up of more and more institutions to impart higher education is important . 
In fact , the Ministry of Human Resource Development has announced that 22 new higher education institutions will be established . 
These are six new IITs , seven new IIMs , three IISERs four new Central Universities / Tribal Universities and one NIT as well as an IIIT spread over several states in the country . 
It is however equally essential that with the physical expansion of educational infrastructure , the education imparted to our students should also be of a high quality . 
The Government is also taking proactive steps to ensure that students receive the required knowledge and skills that are essential to meet new needs . 
An important decision taken recently in this regard is the setting up of a National Ranking Framework for higher educational institutions . 
I hope this will generate healthy competition amongst our institutions for excellence , including IIMs . 
The Government of India also plans to start SWAYAM or ( Smart Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds ) Courses in OPEN , that is ( Online Platform for Education ) mode from 2015 - 16 for all learners interested in acquiring additional skills . 
This will enable our students and teachers obtain quality education at a fraction of the cost while solving the issue of access to higher education in remotest areas of our country . 
It will also help overcome the faculty shortage which is constantly a constraint in almost all our institutions . 
The Government along with the Indian Banks Association is also revising guidelines for ensuring financial support to each potential student so that no one is denied of higher education . 
This will empower meritorious students from low income groups benefit from quality education available at premier institutes such as yours . 
Management solutions are applicable to all domains . 
IIMs can partner with IITs and identify research goalposts that may have larger social relevance . 
While IITs could provide technical solutions for the same , IIMs can make available their managerial expertise . 
I am happy to know that IIM Raipur has partnered All India Institute of Medical Sciences in a novel initiative to develop programs in healthcare management . 
I am also glad that the centers for excellence planned at IIM Raipur are meant to address socially relevant problems , such as Resource Management , Energy Management , Disaster Management , Accreditation and Education , Healthcare Management , Innovation and Entrepreneurship Management . 
Our academic institutes have to be dynamic and hands - on in facing emerging challenges . 
Students today , far from being passive recipients of education imparted by the teachers , are active demand centres gradually seeking to re - define knowledge requirement . 
Institutions of higher education have to promote a culture of excellence and develop core competencies . 
They have to expand capacity to cater to more students and at the same time uphold the quality of instruction . 
They have to resort to technology tools like e - classrooms and knowledge to enable sharing of ideas and intellectual resources like lectures and tutorials . 
We must also be pro - active in developing a management research culture in the country for which IIMs need to collaborate with best of institutions in the world . 
The students of today would be engaged in their lifetime in jobs that perhaps do not exist today . 
They have to be taught critical skills and transferable competencies . 
They have to be infused with qualities of creative - thinking and problem - solving . 
They have to be encouraged in their quest to unearth the hidden and to experience joy in discovering the unknown . 
They have to be trained to possess a universal mindset to enable them interact in the melting pot of the globalized world . 
Research and innovation is the cornerstone of any academic endeavour . 
Their spin - offs could be large and immensely beneficial to wide spectrum of the society . 
It is innovation due to which industrial enterprises show high growth momentum and keep themselves ahead of their competitors . 
As per a 2014 international survey , there are only five Indian firms amongst the world’s hundred most innovative companies . 
We have to strive harder . 
Our academic institutions and industry have to engage with one another and benefit mutually from partnerships in joint research , curriculum development and setting up of chairs , incubation centres and research parks . 
IIMs must assume greater responsibility for overall development and mitigation of problems concerning our society , community and nation at large . 
The faculty in IIMs should provide consultancy for policy and project implementation challenges that both Union and State Governments face . 
Graduates from IIMs should take up projects of relevance to the people of the state and try start companies and corporation which would contribute to the economic development of the area . 
The Government has launched many important initiatives like Swachh Bharat Mission , Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao , Jan - Dhan Yojana , Make - in - India , Ease of Doing Business , Clean Ganga campaign etc . 
A concerted and determined effort to renew India , bolstered by ideas and imagination of a premier institution like IIM Raipur can help our nation realize Gandhiji’s dream of a Swachh and Samarth Bharat . 
Let me congratulate all the graduating students on their success and achievement . 
Convocation signifies the culmination of the phase of formal education . 
It also symbolizes the beginning of a new journey where the knowledge you have gained and the skills you have acquired will be put to sterner test . 
You will achieve success but at times you may face adversity . 
It is in mitigating those trying circumstances that you will prove your mettle . 
Your discipline , commitment and determination will help you navigate through difficult terrain . 
Remember that leaving this academic world does not mean you stop learning as there is knowledge to be gained everywhere and almost everyday from life . 
Life rewards those who engage in life - long learning . 
I request the student community of IIM Raipur to always keep in mind the fact that this wonderful education you have received is a contribution of the nation , state and community . 
The nation invests in its Institutions and Universities because students are our future . 
Students , in turn , have an important responsibility , not just to themselves and their families but also to this country and the community as whole . 
I am confident that the students who have earned their degrees today will take part in nation - building of this great country in a meaningful way . 
The youth of our country are the future stewards of this nation and inheritors of a glorious civilization . 
As we march towards becoming a developed nation , each one of you can play an important role in our progress . 
If the targets of eradication of poverty , health for all , education for all , power for all and higher living standards for all are to be achieved in the near future , it is our youth who must rise to the challenge . 
Strive hard not only to achieve your goals but also to make this country a better place for everyone who lives here . 
I wish you a bright career and fulfilling life ahead . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE TENTH CONVOCATION OF MIZORAM UNIVERSITY
It is a happy occasion for me to be here today and address you in this tenth Convocation of Mizoram University . 
I am also glad to have made use of this opportunity to visit Mizoram , which is my first occasion after I assumed the office of the President of India . 
Let me thank you all for welcoming me to your State and University . 
Mizoram is a storehouse of natural beauty , comprising hilly terrains , deep gorges , meandering streams , picturesque landscape , and rich flora and fauna . 
In particular , the Campus of Mizoram University with its pleasant surroundings and quiet atmosphere is ideally suited for the pursuit of learning . 
Mizoram was a district of the State of Assam before it became a Union Territory in 1972 . In 1987 , it became the 23rd State of our country . 
With a long international border of over 700 kilometres - having Bangladesh to its west and Myanmar to its south and east – Mizoram occupies a vital strategic position . 
The Mizo people are a close - knit society marked by a complete absence of class distinction and gender discrimination . 
They are well - known for their hospitality , and are of kind , selfless and helpful nature . 
Let me congratulate you all on this important occasion . 
It is hearty to see the joy of accomplishment in all of you . 
As you step out of your academic universe today , be assured that your education will always keep you in good stead ; you will thrive wherever you go and shine whatever you do . 
Having said that , I want to remind you all that you owe something to the society at large . 
You are now entrusted with the people’s hopes and expectations . The educated is a trustee of a special responsibility . 
The upliftment of your less fortunate compatriots is a sacred task that bright people like you must perform . 
This obligation to your country is something that you must always cherish . 
It is a bond that you must not sever . So , go ; live your dreams . 
At the same time , live the dreams of your country and countrymen . 
India is today a nation on the move . 
In every field of activity – be it business , industry , trade , education or culture – we are marching forward vigorously led by the ideas , enterprise and energy of our predominantly young population . 
An emerging India offers enormous opportunities for the youth of Mizoram . 
I call upon you to join hands with the youth from the rest of the country in forging the future of our nation . 
Some time back , the capital city of Delhi had witnessed certain tragic incidents of attacks on young people from the north - east . 
Both the Central Government and the Delhi Government have taken firm action , by not only apprehending and punishing the accused but also putting in place measures to ensure that such incidents do not recur . 
We must ensure that the pluralistic character of our nation and her thread of unity , which is the collective pride of all Indians , are not weakened by such unacceptable events . 
Education supports two fundamental objectives of human existence : proliferation of knowledge and formation of character . 
Higher education especially has a unique role to play in preparing the torch - bearers of tomorrow who will endeavour in different fields - from medicine to engineering , teaching , administration , business , politics and social service – to lead our nation to the high tables of global power . 
Though our higher education sector has rapidly expanded over the last few years , we have less to trumpet about the quality of our institutes . 
None of our institutions are ranked in the top two hundred positions by reputed international surveys . 
While I believe that a few renowned Indian institutions can be better placed with a little more methodical approach , a vast majority of our institutions are mired in mediocrity . 
Many meritorious Indian students pursue their higher studies from foreign universities . 
Nobel laureates – Har Gobind Khorana ; Subrahmanyam Chandrasekhar ; Dr . Amartya Sen ; and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan – did their graduate or post - graduate studies in Indian universities before they went abroad for higher learning . 
It is ironical that our higher education system , which is capable of producing world - class scholars , loses them to foreign universities . 
A serious scrutiny is necessary to counter this avoidable trend . 
The annual Conference of Vice Chancellors of Central Universities at Rashtrapati Bhavan provides an opportunity to discuss ways and means to quicken the process of change in our higher education sector . 
This year’s Conference was held in February and I am happy to mention that the Vice Chancellors had a fruitful engagement with other stakeholders and experts from different fields . 
I am confident that the takeaways would be implemented within the timeframe . 
Remember that central universities should be the torchbearers of transformation in India’s higher education . 
Strengthening academic management is urgently required . 
To make learning more effective , teaching pedagogy must be refined , curricula up - dated , inter - disciplinary approach adopted and evaluation mechanism reformed . 
To make faculty gain greater expertise in their field , faculty development programmes must be conducted . 
To achieve excellence , core competencies must be identified and nurtured . 
To create quality awareness , every institution must be benchmarked and accredited . 
It is heartening to note that Mizoram University has been accredited ‘A’ grade by NAAC in 2014 . 
A university must strengthen its linkages with other academic institutes through faculty and student exchange , participation in seminars and workshops , collaborative research , and sharing of academic resources . 
The National Knowledge Network must be put to good use in these endeavours . 
An interface with the industry can benefit a university in terms of involvement of industry personnel in curriculum design and project guidance , sponsorship of chair positions , and setting up of incubation centres and laboratories . 
For that , an industry - interface cell must be set up and industry experts in governance structure co - opted . 
The issue of lack of industrial presence impeding a healthy industrial interface with central universities located in North - East was discussed during this year’s Conference of Vice Chancellors . 
Ministry - level coordination is necessary to address the difficulties . 
A higher educational institution is a role - model for the society . 
It must leverage all expertise to contribute to the socio - economic development of the region . 
The central government has launched : ( i ) Swachh Bharat Mission , aimed at a Clean India by 2019 ; ( ii ) Digital India programme , to usher in a digitally - empowered knowledge society ; and ( iii ) Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana , to create model villages . 
In the Conference of Vice Chancellors , it was decided that every central university will adopt and develop at least five villages . 
I am confident that this University will live up to the expectations . 
Certain global trends are emerging in the higher education sector – be it Massive Open Online Courses ( MOOCs ) that offer the advantages of speed , scale and efficiency ; or Choice - Based Credit System that provides students mobility across the higher educational system . 
Universities must recognize these evolutions in education and prepare themselves to deal with this dynamic environment . 
Our universities have a duty to promote scientific temper amongst their students . 
A way forward could be to give wings to the ingenious ideas of students and grassroots innovators . 
Novel ideas that can be transformed into marketable products deserve mentoring . 
An initiative taken in several central universities is the setting up of Innovation Clubs . 
Activities of these clubs must be dovetailed with innovation incubators located in IITs and NITs in the region . I am hopeful that several new innovations will spring within a few years’ time . 
I thank you once again for inviting me to your annual convocation . 
Let me conclude in the words of Confucius : " Education breeds confidence . Confidence breeds hope . Hope breeds peace” . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF NATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AWARDS 2013
I am indeed happy to be amidst you this evening to confer the National Geo - science Awards for the year 2013 . 
At the outset , I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the recipients of these Awards who have contributed to the growth of geo - sciences in our country through their inspirational and dedicated work . 
These Awards were instituted in 1966 as the National Mineral Awards with the objective to honour and recognize individual and teams of scientists for their extraordinary achievements in the field of fundamental or applied geo - sciences , mining and allied areas . 
Over time , the scope of these Awards was widened to accommodate new and relevant fields of geo - scientific development . 
In 2009 , it was enlarged into the National Geo - science Awards to foster further research in Geo - sciences . 
I compliment the Ministry of Mines for this initiative . 
It is heartening to note that these prestigious Awards not only recognize lifetime contributions but also take cognizance of the outstanding efforts of young researchers . 
Geo - science is a comprehensive branch of science that deals with the planet Earth . 
The phenomena that make Earth the most magnificent spectacle of nature are diverse . 
The study of geo - sciences enables mankind to decipher the interplay of various forces of nature . 
This important science stream helps us to unravel the mystery of the origin and dynamism of the earth , the oceans , earthquakes , volcanoes , river systems and the like . 
It also contributes to our growing understanding of the evolution of life on this planet . 
Geo - science is an old discipline . 
Since ages , it has defined the trajectory of human civilizations and their transitions . 
The findings within the domain of this scientific field have shaped the Stone Age , Copper Age , Bronze Age and Iron Age . 
More recently , it has helped build the foundation of the modern industrial world - be it spaceship or aircraft , cell phone or computer , nuclear devise or missile system . 
Outcomes that have emerged from geo - scientific research have contributed to scientific progress in no small measure . 
India , with a unique geological diversity , has played a significant role in the evolution of geo - sciences . 
The concepts developed in our country on Gondwanaland , Charnockites , Carbonatites , Tectonics , Earthquakes and ore deposits in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century have been instrumental in the growth of this vast discipline . 
A noteworthy development in the 1890s’ India has been the introduction of petrological microscope for the study of rocks for the first time ever . 
India has a rich heritage of geological research work . 
The Geological Survey of India , established in 1851 , is the second oldest amongst such organizations in the world . 
Over the years , it has developed a huge depository of knowledge in diverse fields of geo - science . 
It has helped produce a large pool of talented geo - scientists who have left an indelible mark in different realms from the lofty Himalayas to the abyss of the oceans , the scorching deserts , the remote forests and the freezing Arctic . 
This apex organization has spawned a number of academic organizations , research institutes and exploration agencies . 
I am pleased to see the tradition of research and development being maintained and further nurtured in the different institutes and organizations in our country . 
India’s mineral and mining sector faces an acid test for sustaining the growth potential of our economy . 
Our mineral endowment poses both a challenge and an opportunity for geo - scientists . 
The Government is committed to promote research and development in this area . 
The geo - scientists should evolve an efficient work plan for development , conservation and augmentation of these precious mineral resources . 
They should put forward innovative ideas to achieve sustainable development of our country and at the same time address societal concerns . 
The adverse impact of ecological degradation and climate change has emerged as a major concern the world over . 
No part of the globe is today immune from the menace of environmental disaster . 
Our nation , too , has bore the brunt of a series of natural calamities in the recent times . 
They have resulted in a severe loss of life and property . 
The occurrence of many of these disasters is attributed to human interference with the natural balance . 
There is , therefore , a need for more objective research by the geo - scientific community in the field of disaster management to mitigate environmental hazards and ensure greater resilience to such adversities . 
Our geo - scientific organizations and other institutes have , over the last few decades , invested heavily in analytical and instrumental infrastructure . 
By making good use of these instruments , our scientists should accomplish significant outcomes to shape geo - science of the future . 
James Hutton , who lived in the eighteenth century and is considered the father of modern geology , had said and I quote : " In matters of science , curiosity gratified begets not indolence but new desires”
I am confident that with dedication and enthusiasm , our geo - scientists will beat all odds and come out with flying colours . 
I once again I take the opportunity to congratulate all the scientists awarded today and hope that they continue with their pursuits to set standards of excellence for others . 
With these words , I conclude . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE BANQUET HOSTED IN THE HONOUR OF HIS HIGHNESS SHEIKH TAMIM BIN HAMAD AL - THANI , EMIR OF THE STATE OF QATAR
It gives me great pleasure to welcome Your Highness SheikhTamim bin Hamad Al - Thani and the distinguished members of your delegation to India on your first State visit . 
We have fond memories and vivid recollections of the memorable visits of your respected father , His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al - Thani to India in 1999 , 2005 and 2012 . 
We also remember the visit of Her Highness Sheikha Mozah to India in 2006 . These are important milestones in our relations . 
The visit of the then Prime Minister , Dr . Manmohan Singh , to your country in November 2008 marked a significant step forward in further strengthening our bilateral ties . 
Your Highness , our two countries have deep and rich historical connections based on geographic proximity and cultural commonalities . 
Qatar is a part of our extended neighbourhood . 
Our civilizational links find expression in our mutually beneficial , growing economic and commercial exchanges and close people - to - people contacts . 
There is a lot that we can do together to realize the existing potential in our trade and investment ties . 
The rich experience of our globally reputed companies in executing infrastructure projects of the highest standards is at the disposal of our Qatari friends . 
We are confident that they would be worthy partners in Qatar ' s economic progress and would contribute meaningfully towards your country ' s preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup . 
India deeply values Qatar as a reliable source of energy . 
It is time that we convert our commercial synergies into a deeper energy partnership through India - Qatar joint ventures in refineries and petrochemicals projects in India , as also through joint exploration in third countries . 
Your Highness , India is currently among the fastest growing economies in the world . 
To meet the legitimate aspirations of our people , we need to continue on an inclusive and high - growth trajectory . 
This requires a capital injection of over US $ one trillion in the years to come in our infrastructure sector , including power , ports , highways , supply chains and warehousing , to name a few . 
India invites investors and entrepreneurs from Qatar to look at India’s infrastructure sector and to join in the " Make in India” and " Digital India” initiatives of our Government . 
Our 100 Smart Cities project is open for foreign participation .

- to the continued health and well being of His Highness SheikhTamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al - Thani , 
- to enhanced cooperation between India and Qatar , and
- to the continuing friendship between our peoples . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION CEREMONY OF THE NATIONAL SAFETY AWARDS ( MINES ) – 2011 AND 2012
It gives me great pleasure to be present amidst you to recognize the outstanding performance of award winners of the National Safety Awards ( Mines ) for the years 2011 and 2012 . 
These awards were instituted in 1983 to promote a competitive spirit amongst mine operators to improve safety standards in mines . 
I would like to congratulate all the outstanding performers in the field of mine safety who have been awarded today . 
The Indian mining industry has undergone significant change over the last few decades . 
Intensive mechanization and use of new technology has driven production to high levels . Despite a subdued performance in recent years , coal production was estimated at 492 million tonne and iron ore at 133 million tonne in 2013 - 14 . 
The total value of production of all minerals , including fuel , metallic and non - metallic minerals , was estimated at Rs . 2 . 3 lakh crore for 2013 - 14 . 
Robust output in the mineral sector has contributed to the achievement of our growth objectives in no small measure . 
To meet the growing demand for coal and other minerals , core mining operations are increasingly being outsourced to mining operators . 
The business model in this sector requires them to run on thin profit margins . Sometimes , investments in safety standards are ignored for short term gains . 
In the absence of adequate safety precautions , mining – which is a hazardous industry , constantly challenged by nature - becomes prone to accidents . 
A safe and decent work environment is asine qua non of industrial progress . 
Effective prevention of work - related accidents , injuries and occupational diseases could render sizeable socio - economic benefits . 
Organizations in the mining industry need to proactively address potential safety problems through a comprehensive approach . 
A culture of prevention rather than a culture of reaction is required in the mining industry as a value - driven commitment towards zero tolerance to such incidents . 
In the sphere of safety , a multi - pronged strategy - comprising legislation ; self - regulation ; worker participation in safety management ; and introduction of safety management systems based on risk assessment of workplace - has resulted in a steady decline in fatality rates . 
Moreover , mine safety has benefitted from improvements visible in mode of access into mine , transportation system for men and materials , strata control , ventilation of underground workings , mechanization of operations and use of safety gadgets , improved rescue procedures , better training , and health surveillance . 
Though we are yet to reach the goal of ‘zero harm’ , this paradigm shift in approach to mine safety can justifiably be termed a silent revolution . 
Yet , there are emerging challenges to face . 
With expanding scale of mining operations , intensification of mechanization and extension of mining activities to adverse geo - mining conditions , the management of occupational health and safety ( OHS ) issues are likely to become more complex . 
OHS challenges have to be dealt at both the mine level as well as business level . 
The mining industry has to address crucial aspects like standardisation of OHS programmes , deployment of effective communication tools , measures for enhanced productivity and expectations of the society . 
Mitigating these challenges call for enhanced application of information technology solutions . 
An OHS management system can deliver considerable benefits , including minimizing operational risks and liabilities , meeting regulatory requirements and customer demands , improving corporate image , and achieving competitive advantage . 
Introduction of state - of - the - art technology in mining activity can lead to improvement in safety , besides productivity and financial gains . 
Mines that have adopted modern technology have expanded their businesses by exploiting deposits of lower grades which were hitherto considered uneconomic . 
At the same time , they have gained extensively in terms of safety as improved technology has raised the safety profile of mining operations . 
Another important factor that can elevate safety standards and prevent accidents is training of the mining workforce . 
It is necessary to have in place an effective industry - wise skill development mechanism to achieve accident - free mining . 
For that , a proper understanding is needed about the inter - dependence between work - place environment , technology and operational skill requirement . 
Government initiatives to augment mineral production ought to have a large skilled manpower which calls for modern training facilities . 
Along with that , the demand for trainers will also be high . 
The mineral industry should take the lead in filling this gap by setting up world - class centres for capacity building and skill development of mine workers . 
Such training should impart real life skills to mine workers for identification of hazards and avoidance of dangers in routine and non - routine tasks . 
Concerns about worker safety should engage attention at the highest corporate level . 
Safety and employee health should not only be a part of a company’s mission but also core elements of its business plan , inseparable from productivity and profitability goals . 
I urge the apex management in mining companies to usher in an effective safety management system . 
Mahatma Gandhi had said and I quote : " The future depends on what you do today”
Health and safety of workers should become an important shared agenda for all stakeholders in the mining industry . 
Everyone should come together to make mines safe for our miners . 
I am confident that substantial improvement in mines safety will occur in the years to come . 
Let me once again compliment all the award winners and wish everyone the very best for their endeavours . 
With the hope that the National Safety Awards ( Mines ) will continue to be the catalyst in enhancing occupational health and safety standards among our mine workers , I conclude . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE SECOND CONVOCATION OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY , MANDI
I am happy to join you for this Second Convocation of the Indian Institute of Technology ( IIT ) , Mandi , one of eight IITs established during the Eleventh Plan period . 
It is a sheer delight to visit your institution situated in the Kamand valley , which beckons with its pristine and natural beauty . 
The simple lifestyle of the local agrarian people ; their traditional songs , dances and crafts , enhance the innate grandeur and magnificence of this place . 
Established in 2009 , IIT Mandi is the first among the new IITs to shift to its permanent campus , Kamand . 
The tranquility of this place provides the perfect setting for a seat of higher learning . 
IIT Mandi has gradually expanded its academic programme . 
It offers B - Tech in the streams of computer , electrical and mechanical engineering . 
It has plans to introduce B - Tech in Civil Engineering from August , this year . 
This Institute has more than 650 students , including 148 research scholars . 
Undeterred by the relative remoteness of the location and paucity of physical infrastructure , this Institute has made best efforts to maintain the quality of education . 
I compliment the management , faculty and staff of IIT Mandi for their energy , dynamism and commitment in nurturing this Institute most admirably in its formative years . 
IIT is a global brand today . 
It stands for excellence in scientific and technical education . 
The alumni of IITs have made them and our nation proud , irrespective of the profession they have pursued – be it science or engineering , teaching or research , entrepreneurship or corporate sector , or public service . 
They have earned respect for their intellect , diligence and professionalism . 
I am sure that with hard work and determination , IIT Mandi will keep up the good name of the IIT brand , and its students will shine wherever they go . 
I congratulate all of you who have been awarded degrees today . 
A lot of effort has gone into your success , especially of your teachers , family , friends and well - wishers . 
The nation at large has invested in your well - being in terms of academic infrastructure and physical amenities that you availed of during your stay here . 
As you leave the portals of your alma mater today enriched and fulfilled by your training , remember that you have a duty to respond to the needs of your society . 
A Vedic verse says and I quote : " Vidya dadati vinayam ; vinayat yaati patratam ; Patratva dhanamapnoti ; dhanaddharmaha tataha sukham” , that is , " knowledge creates humility ; from humility comes good fortune ; with good fortune one performs dharma ; in performing dharma , one becomes happy” . 
I am sure that you all will take the path of sincerity , industry and conviction to be a winner in life . 
Our technical institutions must usher in social consciousness amongst our budding engineers and scientists . 
Developing professional competence apart , these centres of scientific learning must induce social orientation in their students . 
They must help create a pool of bright and motivated youth who will use their knowledge and ingenuity to find solutions to socio - economic problems . 
I am glad to learn that IIT Mandi has established an Inter - disciplinary Socio - technical Practicum in collaboration with the Worcester Polytechnic Institute of USA . 
It engages students in projects aimed at deriving solutions to problems like traffic , cleanliness and drinking water . 
Our higher educational institutions are an integral part of the local eco - system . 
They must assume greater responsibility for overall development of their region . 
The Government has taken important initiatives , aimed at financial inclusion , creation of model villages , Clean India and digital infrastructure . 
I have urged our institutions of higher learning to adopt five villages each and convert them into model villages in line with the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana . 
I am confident that IIT Mandi will take active part in this drive . 
I also call upon you to play a key role in realizing the objectives of the ‘Digital India’ programme in this region . 
The growing demand for engineering education has resulted in the establishment of a number of technical institutions . 
Yet in this proliferation drive , quality of instruction and physical infrastructure has taken a backseat . 
The educational standard of our country at the tertiary level has been starkly brought out by two reputed international surveys . 
They have graded not a single Indian institution amongst the top two hundred universities in the world . 
We do have a few institutions that can do much better in the rankings with a more proactive and methodological approach . 
A higher rank can open fresh avenues of growth and placement for students . 
It can also encourage a greater flow of faculty and students from abroad , opening new vistas of frontier technology . 
Newly - created institutions will take some time to be in the reckoning . 
Nevertheless , you must take keen interest in the process not only with the objective of securing a rank but also to achieve all - round academic development . 
Rejuvenating our higher education sector calls for greater dynamism amongst our institutions . 
They must identify one or two departments , in which they have core competence , and nurture them into centres of excellence . 
The quality of faculty must be of a high order to provide students world - class instruction . 
With fast occurring changes in various disciplines , the faculty must keep themselves abreast with the latest developments . 
To bring about qualitative changes in teaching , the newly - established IITs must leverage the expertise available in the older IITs . 
The National Knowledge Network offers a platform for academic institutions to collaborate peer group learning in emerging areas . 
Additionally , this network can compensate for shortages in faculty , infrastructure and resources . 
Our educational institutions must make an effort to develop linkages with international academic institutions . 
In this context , it is heartening to note that IIT Mandi had signed an MOU in 2011 with TU9 , the nine leading technical universities of Germany . 
You must make full use of these inter - linkages to provide global exposure to your faculty and students . 
Knowledge and innovation are the keystones of progress . 
Competitive advantage can be derived from an eco - system conducive to new learning , research and innovation . 
Inter - disciplinary approach in course curricula and research , strengthening under - graduate research and making research integral to the teaching - learning process must garner focused attention . 
You must build strong linkages with the industry . 
An industry - interface cell must be in place . 
The cell must engage itself in sponsoring of chair positions by industry ; drafting of experts from industry in project guidance and curriculum design ; and setting up of incubation centres , laboratories and research parks . 
Success of initiatives like ‘Make in India’ hinges on manufacturing quality industrial products where academia - industry interface would play a critical role . 
The older IITs have a strong alumni network . 
They leverage the expertise of many of their alumni who have done well in their chosen fields . 
The newer ones must make every effort to connect with their alumni . 
They could be made a part of governance structures , or engaged in business and project mentoring and curriculum design . 
I am certain that the alumni of IIT Mandi will involve themselves , in due course , in the affairs of this Institution in a meaningful manner . 
Before concluding , let me say that higher educational institutions , particularly engineering institutes , must promote a scientific temperament and a spirit of inquiry in their students . 
They must encourage their students to follow their curiosity and explore their creativity . 
They must equip their students to think beyond their textbooks . 
They must spur ingenious ideas in them . 
I wish all the students the very best for the future . 
I also wish the management and faculty good luck for their endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE 58TH SESSION OF THE ALL INDIA AYURVEDIC CONGRESS
It is indeed a privilege to address this distinguished assembly of Vaidyas and practitioners of Ayurveda . 
I would like to , first of all , congratulate the All India Ayurveda Mahasammelan and Vidyapeeth for organising this 58th All India Convention on Ayurveda and providing an important forum for the experts in this field to exchange views , deliberate on the modern application of this ancient science and collectively address the task of promoting its use . 
Ayurveda , as a science , belongs to India . It is the oldest surviving system of medicine in the world . 
Its origins have been traced back more than 5000 years . 
It is believed that the concepts of Ayurveda were known to the people of the Indus Valley Civilization . 
The science was significantly developed during the Vedic period of our history . 
In fact , the main source of knowledge in this field are the Vedas – particularly the Atharvaveda believed to have been written around 1000 B . C . 
By the 8th Century , these texts were translated into Arabic and Persian . 
We know that in the 5th Century the erudite treatises of the greatest of our Vaidyas , Sushrutha and Charaka were translated from Sanskrit into Chinese and in 700 A . D . Chinese scholars were studying medicine in India at the University of Nalanda . 
We see that Arabic works derived from our Ayurvedic texts reached Europe by the 12th Century . 
Today , it is a matter of satisfaction that Ayurveda has not only sustained itself in many of the countries of South Asia , but is also popular across the seas in some of the countries of Europe and in the United States of America . 
In India , most of us consciously - or as a matter of traditional practice - are relying on Ayurveda in our daily lives . 
Even those of us who are not formally trained in Ayurveda have embraced its principles in our dietary preferences and day to day routine . 
In all the diverse cultures of the different regions of India , herbs , spices , plants , leaves , flowers and oils , in countless combinations are prepared by households and administered as preventive supplements or medicinal remedies for addressing ailments - big and small . 
There is , for example , a specific reason for turmeric to be a key ingredient in our everyday food ; the tulsi leaf is , similarly , incorporated in the holy water or charan amrit consumed after daily prayers and ghee made of cow’s milk has been a staple cooking medium down the ages . 
Due to the simple nature of the ingredients in Ayurvedic remedies , many of us prefer to rely upon Ayurveda to avoid the harmful side effects of modern medicine . 
It is unfortunate that Ayurveda , as a science , had been suppressed for a long period when India was under colonial rule - due to which training and education in this ancient science suffered . 
Fortunately , in post - Independence India , both our Central and State Governments have taken a number of steps to revive this invaluable treasure of ancient medicinal secrets . 
Government of India has , today , a full - fledged Ministry of AYUSH for the development and promotion of Ayurveda , Yoga & Naturopathy , Unani , Siddha and Homoeopathy . 
This Ministry has been working with the practitioners of our indigenous medicinal systems to develop and strengthen education and training in these sciences . 
The Sushruta Samhita and Charaka Samhita are now available to students in Hindi and English . 
I am confident that such efforts will significantly encourage the development of Ayurveda in our country and abroad . 
I would like to emphasise that Ayurveda should not be regarded as merely a system of healthcare : it is , rather , a set of disciplines that work together to create balance and harmony within us . 
It is based on the perception that life represents a relationship between the atma or soul , mana or mind , indriya or senses and sarira or body . 
It is a unique combination of science and philosophy for balancing the body’s physical , mental , emotional and spiritual components . 
Ayurvedic doctors believe that this equilibrium is necessary for good health . 
Creating such a balance helps to heal the sick , to maintain the health of those who are well , and to prevent disease and promote quality of life . 
For too long has Ayurveda been dismissed as an ‘unproven’ discipline . 
I would like to see Ayurvedic medicine being demystified and popularized through informative marketing and user friendly packaging ; I would like to see the day when we have mobile clinics delivering Ayurvedic treatment and medicine through the villages in all parts of India . 
I would particularly like to encourage the youth of India to study , safeguard , practice and propagate this ancient knowledge system . 
It is believe that centuries ago , the medicinal systems of Ayurveda and Siddha had laid down protocols for successfully treating diseases that resembled the diseases that we know today as HIV and tuberculosis . 
If these remedies could be researched and the findings pursued , they could bring new hope to millions and revolutionize modern medicine . 
To achieve this , I would like to see greater collaboration between ayurvedic and allopathic researchers to widen the database of treatment protocols and successful medical practices for the benefit of our people . 
It would also be appropriate to establish channels of direct connectivity between Ayurvedic laboratories and drug manufacturers . 
Some modern hospitals are additionally offering Ayurveda in the name of integrative medicine . 
I would definitely encourage hospitals all over India to add the facility and service of Ayurvedic treatment in whichever way they can . 
In the same context , the importance of Yoga has been acknowledged for protecting health and curing disease . 
This year , the United Nations adopted without a vote , a resolution , declaringJune 21stas International Day of Yoga , recognizing that " Yoga provides a holistic approach to health and well being” . 
As Yoga and Ayurveda are complimentary to each other - and the practice of Yoga can increase the beneficial effects of Ayurveda – a combination of yoga and ayurveda can go along way in giving good health and preventing disease . 
I am confident that the deliberations at this 58th Convention will serve to give a new impetus to the awareness and practice of Ayurveda and enhance its relevance in our contemporary society by simplifying and popularizing it through modern scientific interventions . 
With these words , I once again congratulate the organizers of this conference and convey to them my best wishes for its success . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE SIXTY FOURTH CONVOCATION OF PANJAB UNIVERSITY
I am happy to be here today and be a part of this Sixty Fourth Convocation of Panjab University , one of the country’s oldest and leading centres of higher education . 
At the outset , let me thank the University for inviting me and giving the opportunity to address this august gathering . 
Punjab University has a long history dating back to the Nineteenth Century . 
It was established in 1882 at Lahore as the University of Punjab . 
In 1947 after India’s Independence , it was re - established at Shimla as the East Panjab University . 
Consequent to the re - organization of the State of Punjab in 1966 , Panjab University with its main campus in Chandigarh acquired the status of an ‘inter - state body corporate’ , which is unique for an educational institution in our country . 
Punjab University is today a vibrant centre of higher learning . Its 78 Departments , four Chairs and four Regional Centres profess in the wide range of faculties from Arts to Science , Law , Management , Engineering , Medicine and Agriculture . 
With a long tradition of pursuing excellence in teaching and research , several departments of this prestigious University are covered by the University Grants Commission ( UGC ) and the Department of Science and Technology for special assistance and fund support . 
Two centres of excellence – one , on nano technology , and the other , on gender audit – were supported by the UGC during the Eleventh Plan period . 
With facilities for Stem Cell Research and Drug Development , Panjab University has also been recognized by the UGC as a " University with Potential for Excellence in Bio - medical Sciences " . 
This University has research collaborations with leading research and technology institutions in India and abroad . 
Punjab University has educated generations of students , many of whom have risen to occupy eminent positions in various walks of life . 
It counts amongst its distinguished alumni a former Prime Minister and such others including Nobel Laureate Late Dr . Har Gobind Khorana , leading figures in public life and civil servants . 
That this University has excelled in providing quality education has been recognized internationally . It is heartening to note that at the 276 - 300th bracket in the Times Higher Education Survey 2014 - 15 , Panjab University is the highest - ranked Indian institution . 
I applaud you all for this achievement . I am confident that you will touch greater heights through the same spirit of dedication and commitment . 
Let me congratulate you on coming out successful and deserving of this joyous occasion in your life . 
I can see a palpable sense of delight in you . 
In this moment of glory , you must comprehend the hopes and expectations that your near and dear ones , the society and the nation at large have from you . 
India is a shining example of democratic polity and pluralistic society . 
Democracy not only gives rights but also entails responsibilities . 
Educated youth must play a vital role in building a resurgent new India . 
Your education has given you an opportunity to make a difference . 
This is the time to engage with our beautiful , complex , and sometimes noisy democracy . 
I am particularly happy to note that two thirds of the PhD graduates are women . My special congratulations to them . 
Competent and committed individuals are necessary to build the country of our dreams . 
Our universities must produce men and women of character and integrity . 
Mahatma Gandhi had said and I quote : Real education consists in drawing the best out of yourself . 
What better book can there be than the book of humanity ? 
Bapu ' s call to follow the book of humanity can resolve the dilemmas of society today . 
I am confident that you will live your dream , and that of your country and countrymen . 
A country’s ascent is determined to a large extent by human capital . 
As such , education plays a decisive role in shaping the destiny of nations . 
At the apex of the education system is the university . 
Indian universities have potential to be the leading institutions in the world . 
For that , urgent improvements in academic management are needed . 
To make learning more effective , teaching pedagogy must be refined , curricula up - dated regularly , an inter - disciplinary approach adopted and evaluation mechanism reformed . 
To make faculty up - to - date in their field of knowledge , faculty recharge programmes must be conducted . 
To pursue excellence , core competencies must be identified and centres of excellence nurtured . 
To create quality consciousness , every institution must be benchmarked and accredited . 
There are four kinds of stakeholders with which a higher academic institution can gainfully leverage its linkages , to develop into a world - class institution : 
oOne , it can gain from interacting with other academic institutes in India and abroad through : exchange of faculty and students ; participation in seminars and workshops ; joint research papers ; collaborative research ; and sharing of academic resources like course material and resource persons . 
It would be worthwhile to make full use of the National Knowledge Network in these endeavours . 
Two , an industry interface can benefit in terms of : involvement of industry personnel in curriculum design and project guidance ; sponsorship of chair positions ; and setting up of incubation centres and laboratories . 
These could be facilitated through an industry - interface cell as well as by induction of industry experts in governance mechanisms . 
Three , an institute can reach out to its alumni who retains an emotional connect with their alma mater . 
Some of them could be associated for academic management through governing bodies ; and for business and project mentoring and curriculum design . 
Four , a higher educational institution interacts with the society at large . 
As the persuasive power of a university extends beyond the classroom and teaching , it can act as a role - model to usher in socio - economic development . 
The central government has launched : ( i ) Swachh Bharat Mission , aimed at a Clean India by 2019 ; ( ii ) Digital India programme , to usher in a digitally - empowered knowledge society ; and ( iii ) Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana ( SAGY ) , to create model villages through their holistic development . 
Our academic institutions must take active part in these initiatives . 
They should adopt at least five villages and leverage all academic and other resources to offer solutions to their problems and develop them as model villages . ·
Higher educational institutions would do well to recognize emerging global trends that are creating new models of knowledge dispensation . 
Rising costs of higher education and changing profile of education seekers , aided by technology , has led to Massive Open Online Courses . 
Due to its advantage of speed , scale and efficiency , it is fast catching up as the preferred mode of learning . 
Blended MOOCs - online instruction supplemented by periodic classroom interaction – also have the potential to gain ground . 
Choice - Based Credit System has been introduced that will provide students mobility across the higher educational system . 
Universities must note these evolutions in education and take steps to maximize benefits . 
Many innovative ideas are born out of the ingenuity of the common man . 
Mentoring them to validate ideas and design viable products calls for the development of an innovation value - chain . 
Higher learning institutions , due to their multiple linkages , can propel this eco - system . 
Many central institutions have started Innovation clubs to spur an innovation culture and translate ‘inclusion in innovation’ into a workable framework . 
Your University is a pioneer on many fronts . 
You , too , can open such a club and link some of the ingenious ideas of grassroots innovators in this region to innovation incubators in technical and research institutions . 
A scientific temper , which takes one’s imagination beyond the realm of grades and classroom , is essential in our students . 
Our institutions must fire the power of imagination of their students . 
The teacher must encourage the taught to think beyond books , question concepts and accept a proposition only after investigation . 
Students must have a grand vision which they can , through research and inquiry , translate into reality . 
With these words , I conclude . I once again compliment the graduating students and wish them a bright future ahead . 
I also wish the management and faculty of Panjab University the very best for the future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE ROUNDTABLE ON FINANCING OF INNOVATIONS WITH LEADERS OF BANKING AND FINANCIAL SECTORS
It is my pleasure to attend this concluding session of the Festival of Innovations . 
To begin with , I thank NABARD for taking the initiative to organize a Round - table on " financing of innovations” with leaders of the banking and financial sectors . 
It is heartening to see the enthusiastic participation of many leading banks and financial institutions in today’s forum . 
The high growth that we have envisaged is possible only with productivity improvements across all sectors of the economy . 
Innovations in different segments , at different levels and for different sections will aid this process in no small measure . 
The course of development of innovation involves the conversion of a novel idea into a viable product . 
Financing of innovation , being a critical step , the role of the banking system is paramount in the entire innovation value - chain . 
A nation which performs high on innovation has , among other factors , a buoyant and supportive financial sector to leverage innovations . 
In India unfortunately , there are many instances of innovations that are languishing for want of financial support . 
There is an urgent need to deliberate on the strategy required for changing the climate of cooperation between innovators , investors and entrepreneurs . 
I am told that this week - long festival was marked by fruitful interactions between grassroots innovators and various stakeholders of the innovation eco - system , both within and outside the country . 
The government has taken several initiatives to encourage innovations and start - ups that will help generate jobs and overcome poverty . 
Under thePradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana , the banking sector - primarily the public sector banks - successfully embarked upon an ambitious drive to provide access to the weaker and poorer sections to a bank account and other financial products . 
Within a span of six months , the coverage under the scheme has been close to hundred percent , with a record 13 . 2 crore new bank accounts opened , 11 . 5 crore RuPay debit cards issued , and over Rs . 11 , 000 crore deposited . 
Despite the achievements , there are challenges to overcome still . 
Only a small number of those who open accounts have access to credit for improving their livelihood opportunities . 
In particular , I would like to draw your attention to the financial needs of our ingenious youth both in rural and urban areas that are yet to be adequately met by the banking sector . 
It would be appropriate if banks open dedicated counters in towns and cities to meet the needs of innovators . 
Grassroots innovators are constrained by the lack of a well - established market . 
Some do not even possess the requisite skills and acumen to convert their innovations into sustainable and marketable products . 
These potential entrepreneurs require technical assistance . 
Hence provision of financial assistance apart , mentoring is also a significant influencing factor in the innovation - development framework . 
For want of mentoring and financing , many bright students who possess innovative solutions to problems either go abroad or pursue a different profession , resulting in what one may call ‘brain drift’ . 
Arresting this trend calls for the formulation of special schemes in the banking sector to make the ideas - to - market transformation possible . 
The banking system , in collaboration with the National Innovation Foundation , can help create a pool of mentors in every district to assess and meet the financial needs of the innovators . 
Bankers have to take the initiative to reach out to the innovators , mentor them , and wherever possible , connect them with their other clients who may help them in expanding their market . 
This role of creating linkages between creative people and successful clients could be a game - changing institutional innovation . 
A bank manager can open more doors for an innovator in an hour than what an innovator could possibly be able to do in a year . 
The banks would do well to have in place a monitoring mechanism to ensure managerial facilitation for innovators . 
An increased awareness amongst the innovators - that help is round the corner - is required to be built up . 
It is pertinent that sensitization and capacity building form an important agenda of inclusive innovation system . 
In this context , I urge the banks present in this forum to consider sending some of their managers to the Festival of Innovations next year . 
This will provide the banking personnel an opportunity to interact with the innovators and gain insights about how best to support them . 
Central universities , IITs and NITs have set up Innovation Clubs to build linkages with the grassroots innovators . 
Banks may also join hands with these clubs to provide them requisite advice about taking innovative ideas forward . 
New inclusive institutional arrangements are needed to give innovators and innovation - based enterprises a fair chance of success . 
Recent initiatives like the Atal Innovation Mission and the Self - Employment and Talent Utilization ( SETU ) scheme will help spring up thousands of start - ups across the country . 
The banking network in our country should be fully geared to meet the challenge of supporting these new entrepreneurial ventures . 
I have fond remembrance of the time 32 years back when , during my first tenure as the Finance Minister , NABARD was established . 
Over these years , NABARD has carved a special place for itself in unfolding the story of India’s economic development . 
I applaud NABARD for incorporating in its corporate mission the promotion of innovative initiatives , and for working towards its achievement through a systematic and strategic approach . 
Particularly , the effort of NABARD in the sphere of financing rural innovations through the creation of a separate fund is praiseworthy . 
Leveraging its experience of over three decades , NABARD will have an important role to play in fulfilling the objectives of an innovation - oriented India . 
I once again compliment NABARD for organizing this meaningful dialogue on financing of innovation . 
I call upon all the concerned agencies to start working on the various recommendations that have emerged from the deliberations . 
I urge the Ministry of Finance to support the banks in whatever manner possible to enable them to be more accessible and accountable towards innovators . 
In the end , I compliment the National Innovation Foundation for their singular contribution in making this first Festival of Innovations a great success . I declare the Festival closed . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURAL CEREMONY OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON “CLEAN AND CAPABLE INDIA OF GANDHI’S DREAM”
It is my privilege to be here with you today for the inauguration of this International Seminar on " Clean and Capable India of Gandhi’s Dream” . 
At the outset , let me compliment the Rajghat Samadhi Committee for organizing this symposium on a topic of great relevance . 
I also thank the Committee for giving me the opportunity to share my views before this august audience . 
It is only apt that this seminar is being held on a day , which 85 years back , marked a defining moment in our freedom struggle – the start of theDandi March by Mahatma Gandhi for Salt Satyagraha . 
The breaking of the unjust salt law by Gandhiji through the symbolic act of salt - making triggered the larger Civil Disobedience Movement across the country . 
It not only shook the foundations of the British Empire towards India’s independence , but also helped garner world - wide attention about our nation’s plight . 
Gandhiji was a revolutionary of an extraordinary nature , with a rare farsightedness clearly demonstrated , a century ago . 
Throughout his life , Gandhiji learnt from each and every experience . 
He had the insight and ingenuity to suggest measures to root out a problem rather than search for ways to subside it . 
Philip Noel - Baker , the British representative to the United Nations Security Council , had once stated that ‘Gandhi was the friend of the poorest and the loneliest and the lost’ . 
He had also predicted that Gandhiji’s ‘greatest achievements are still to come’ . 
On the sad demise of Gandhiji , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had rightly said and I quote : 
" The light is gone and yet it will shine for a thousand years”
Since then , the world has witnessed sea - change in social , political and economic landscapes . 
Yet , the importance of Gandhian thought of truth , morality and ethics remain integral to our national consciousness . 
Gandhian philosophy never turns obsolete , as even decades after his death world leaders continue to follow his ideals to achieve human development . 
We have recently embarked upon two important initiatives : ( i ) Swachh Bharat Mission – to achieve a Clean India by 2nd October 2019 , to coincide with the 150th Birth Anniversary of Gandhiji ; and ( ii ) Make - in - Indiacampaign – aimed at enhancing the manufacturing capability of our nation . 
The noble aims ofSwachh andSamarth ( or capable ) Bharat comprised a significant part of the Gandhian discourse . 
I hope the discussions by scholars at this forum through the prism of Gandhiji’s vision would lead to greater public awareness of the long - drawn imperative to have a clean and capable India . 
Gandhiji visualized cleanliness as having three dimensions - a clean mind , a clean body and clean surroundings . 
Holding that ‘cleanliness is next to godliness’ , he had said and I quote : 
" We can no more gain God’s blessing with an unclean body than with an unclean mind . A clean body cannot reside in an unclean city”
Taking a clue from what Gandhiji had asserted , the Swachh Bharat Missionenvisages the provision of sanitation facilities , including toilets , waste disposal systems and safe drinking water , to every family . 
A winning strategy to achieve a state of cleanliness , to my mind , would comprise engaging the citizenry , addressing the reduction of waste and improving the processing of waste . 
Gandhiji highlighted the necessity of self - reliant villages to achieve equity and sustainability in economic growth . 
Firm in the belief that India lived in her villages he suggested a lifestyle structure comprising education , employment and health facilities that will encourage people to reside happily in rural areas . 
For him , reconstructing villages was the foremost step in rebuilding the nation and in achieving self - sufficiency and social equality . 
He espoused the spirit ofSamarth or capability for India to achieve economic self - reliance at large . 
The Make - in - India campaign envisages turning Gandhiji’s dream of a self - sufficient and productive India into a reality . 
It aims at India becoming ‘Samarth’ on all fronts of economic development by facilitating investment , promoting innovation , fostering skill development and establishing best - in - class infrastructure . 
The advantages of democracy , demography and demand are on India’s side . 
It is a push through a comprehensive strategy that is required to usher in a world - class manufacturing set - up in our country . 
Steps in this direction include : a facilitatory governance mechanism ; building of smart cities and industrial clusters ; development of specialized skills in the youth ; and establishment of dedicated freight corridors for improved connectivity . 
More concretized action is necessary . 
Select domestic companies having leadership position in innovation and new technology should be identified to turn them into lead global businesses . 
Advanced and environmentally - sensitive manufacturing companies should be encouraged to make them an important part of the global value - chain . 
Overall , the ‘Make - in - India’ programme should lead to an attitudinal shift in how India relates to investors : not as a permit - issuing authority but as a true business partner . 
A concerted effort to refurbish India will help realize Gandhiji’s dream of aSwachhandSamarth Bharat . 
The support and contribution of the wider section of society , including key stakeholders , is necessary . 
Gandhiji’s dream was guided by the light of knowledge and wisdom gained over centuries . 
Hence , a great responsibility is on the shoulders of those who understand his vision , to play a key role in this transformation . 
I expect the deliberations in this seminar to cast new light on the depth and expanse of Gandhiji’s vision , and the ways in which it can become the guiding path for our effort . 
Gandhiji’s dream is our dream ; his vision must lead us through the challenges of the present towards a clean , green and self - sufficient Bharat . 
With these words , I conclude . I once again applaud the Rajghat Samadhi Committee for convening this important seminar . 
I also wish them the very best for all its future pursuits . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE COMMEMORATIVE EXHIBITION ON THE THEME “INDIA AND WORLD WAR - I”
It gives me immense pleasure to be here this evening at the Manekshaw Centre for inaugurating the Commemorative Exhibition on the theme , " India and World War – I” . 
At the outset , let me compliment the Indian Armed Forces for organizing this exhibition to walk down the memory lane to recognize and celebrate the bravery of the Indian soldiers who laid down their lives during the First War . 
The centenary of the First World War is an important landmark in world history . 
This occasion reminds the world community of the immense loss of life and material that the world had to endure in pursuit of global peace and stability . 
In this effort the Indian soldiers played an important role in the various theatres of the War . 
The Indian contribution of a volunteer army to the war effort was large in comparison to many other contributing nations . 
During the War , Indian soldiers were in active service on virtually every war front . 
They carved a niche for themselves by their outstanding loyalty , courage and selfless service and played a significant role in influencing the outcome of the War . 
The Allied Forces were also in a position to sign an armistice because of the support of the Indian soldiers . 
A hundred years ago , the world was different . Even though our country was under colonial rule , Indian soldiers etched their name in world history through their bravery and valour . 
The gallantry of the Sikhs and Gurkhas in the battlefields of Gallipoli is well - known . 
So is the bravery of the Garhwali , Dogra , Punjabi and Maratha Soldiers , who fought in the battlefields of Flanders and Somme . 
These soldiers not only won the pickets and trenches but also the hearts of the local population . 
The humble upbringing of these soldiers in their villages , the teachings of the Ramayana and Mahabharata , infused in the Indian soldier’s conscience a strong set of values – the value of being ‘just’ in their dealings with those whom they have vanquished and of ‘resolutestance’ against the adversary when under siege . 
There are numerous battles of this War which highlight the perseverance of the Indian soldiers where along with the British battalions they stoically withstood the fierce attacks of their adversaries . 
It was for the fine soldierly attributes that by the end of the Great War , the Indian soldiers were decorated with 11 Victoria Crosses , 5 Military Crosses and numerous other awards . 
To my mind , these men made their sacrifices with a sense of pride and righteousness . 
This needs to be recognized and celebrated . Today , we pay our respects and honour these men . 
A hundred years ago , the youth of many a nation was wasted on account of human greed and misguided notions . 
Today , conflicts arising out of pernicious designs of some terror outfits are claiming thousands of valuable lives in many parts of the world . 
The rise of non - state actors and lethal terrorist entities is a threat to our nation . 
The Armed Forces of our nation are capable of meeting all challenges and threats to our national integrity and contribute to world peace and security . 
We have developed an effective deterrence and stand ready to defend our territorial integrity . 
The professionalism which our armed forces display today is a continuation of what was so bravely exhibited by the Indian soldiers in the First World War . 
It is to acknowledge the role played by the Indian soldiers during this historic War , that this Commemorative Event has been organized . 
It will remind us all once again about the sacrifices made by our valiant soldiers and the role they played for peace and security in the world . 
I once again compliment the Indian Armed Forces for organizing this memorable event . 
I wish all of you the very best for the future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF THE STREE SHAKTI PURASKARS AND NARI SHAKTI PURUSKARS FOR THE YEAR 2014 THE OCCASION OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY
I would , first of all , like to extend to you and through you , to all the women of India , my warm greetings and hearty felicitations on the occasion of International Women’s Day . 
We , in India , have been celebrating this day by recalling the heroism and unparalleled legacy of some of the great women in India’s history - that continues to inspire our vision and efforts for women’s empowerment in our country . 
It is only fitting that Government of India pays tribute to these iconic women by conferring , every year , national awards in their names to outstanding contemporary women who have made an uncommon contribution to women’s empowerment . 
As we know , " shakti” , in Sanskrit , denotes a concept and a personification of feminine creative power . 
‘Stree shakti’ denotes the ability of women to be in command of their lives and regulate themselves in social , political and economic terms It means that they have the power to move from the periphery of society to its mainstream and wield influence from its core . 
I am glad to see that we have instituted eight additional Nari Shakti Awards . 
I am also very glad to see that all the awardees have , through their exceptional endeavours , strong grass root presence and deep insight into women’s concerns , made inspiring initiatives for the empowerment of women . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , I would like to take this opportunity to convey my heartfelt appreciation of the countless women who are the silent backbone of our economy . 
They toil shoulder to shoulder with our men in the agriculture sector for our food security , in factories for our nation’s economic growth , they work on project sites to build our national infrastructure and they strive in corporate offices and in banks . 
As professionals , they are second to none in their achievements and their services as doctors and nurses , as space and nuclear scientists and in Government offices and politics are invaluable in forging a path of progress and growth for our people . 
Therefore , it is only appropriate that we should remind ourselves that the empowerment of women and their equality , liberty and dignity are not a distant goal or fond aspiration of the women of our country . 
It is one of their sacred rights . 
It is not a privilege that they should seek . 
It has been a key element in the codes of conduct that our ancient societies prescribed for themselves more than 3000 years ago . 
In the Vedic civilization , women were always given the highest level of respect and freedom and at the same time , their protection and safety was a sacred duty of society . 
This is our culture , this is our heritage . We should not allow ourselves to forget this . 
When the founding fathers of independent India drafted our constitution , they ensured that its principles and provisions duly emphasised women’s rights and equality . 
Our Central and State Governments have been duly prioritizing women’s development . 
There are , nevertheless , enduring societal perceptions and attitudes which inhibit the pace of improvement in the condition and position of Indian women in our society and economy . 
These call for urgent individual as well as collective introspection . 
We must identify these weaknesses and their root cause . 
We must make the required effort to remove the structural and institutional barriers that inhibit the economic and social transformation of women in India . 
For example , violence against women continues to threaten the safety , well being and potential of women and girls across our country . 
Even their perception of their respective vulnerabilities constrains their freedom of movement and access to education , work and essential services . 
The pace of progress in providing the desired level of safety and security to our women needs to be hastened through better enforcement of legislation towards this end . 
There is an urgent need for all our people to be more conscious of their attitude and demeanour towards women . 
I cannot emphasise enough that all women must be addressed and treated with due respect and courtesy . 
This training should be given to our children from a very young age . 
The key issue , that must be stressed , is that for true empowerment , an effective convergence of all aspects impacting a women’s life is required - be it social , economic or political . 
Due to cross - cutting linkages and the interrelated dimensions of a holistic approach to empowerment , absence or weakness of efforts in even one area will lead to a failure in the sustainability of outcomes or the momentum generated by the other components . 
Therefore , such an engendering process has to be built into our Government schemes . 
Some of the best practices adopted by States and Union Territories for development of women need to be identified , adopted and up - scaled in Government of India schemes . 
The efforts and initiatives of women’s groups and the wide network of non - governmental organisations should be built upon by Central Ministries / Departments . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , let us , on International Women’s Day , reaffirm our commitment to ensure gender equity and empowerment of women in India to enable them to realize their full potential and participate meaningfully in all aspects of our country’s development . 
With these words , I once again congratulate the winners of Stree Shakti and Nari Shakti Puruskar . I thank the Ministry of Women and Child Development for organizing this event and encouraging the distinguished awardees to work towards a noble cause . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE RAPPORTEURS’ SUMMARIZATION ON GLOBAL ROUNDTABLE ON INCLUSIVE INNOVATIONS
At the outset , I extend a warm welcome to the distinguished national and international participants of this Global Round - table on Inclusive Innovations . 
I have listened with interest the summary of outcomes of the discussions that took place in this forum , as presented by Prof . Gupta . 
I also thank the two distinguished delegates for sharing their perspectives . 
This topic , according to me , is pertinent for any nation desirous of ensuring inclusive development for all sections of society through innovation . 
India has had a long tradition of grassroots innovation . 
. From time to time , the common people in this country have ushered in novel solutions to overcome their day - to - day difficulties . 
The drivers that influence the pursuit of innovation are many – from basic survival to propulsion of growth . 
A healthy eco - system is needed for harnessing the innovative potential of various segments in different sectors and at multiple levels in our society . 
Creating an inclusive eco - system calls for linkages between grassroots innovators on the one hand , and academic institutions and market forces , on the other . 
Countries successful in building such a network have become innovation leaders . 
As an attempt to bring educational institutions and grassroots innovators within the ambit of an inclusive innovation system , a programme for Innovation Scholars In - Residence was started in Rashtrapati Bhavan last year . 
I am glad that the second batch of innovation - scholars has joined us today . 
During their two - week stay at the Rashtrapati Bhavan , they will be mentored and connected with relevant stakeholders to give wings to their ideas . 
Educational institutions have a critical role to play in nurturing innovations in the society . 
India , with a large network of 713 universities and over 36 , 000 colleges , is poised to play a leading part in developing an innovation eco - system . 
To catalyze the institutions of higher learning in this process , I have been urging the leaders of the higher education sector to establish a connection between their institutes and grassroots innovations in their hinterland , and to also set up Innovation Clubs . 
Youth power has to be galvanized for nation - building . 
Thus , the students have to be encouraged tosensethe unmet needs of the common man , and search , spread and celebrateinnovations . 
The members of these Innovation Clubs are participating in the Festival of Innovation , which is taking place for the first time in Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
The presence of distinguished participants from India and abroad will definitely provide a global platform to all the innovators and participants of this important Festival . 
Many outstanding social , educational and corporate leaders present here have pioneered initiatives aimed at taking the Indian grassroots story forward . 
Our traditional knowledge has contributed to the introduction of many popular ayurvedic medicines and other such products . 
At the same time , modern applications of science and technology have increased livelihood opportunities for the people . 
A significant breakthrough in our march towards development and progress is possible ; but with challenges , to overcome which , a collaborative effort of all stakeholders is necessary . 
Noble Laureate Prof . Yunus had created an outstanding model for micro - finance that has led to the emancipation of poor in developing countries . 
To my mind , the next major breakthrough will come through micro venture innovation finance , which has been pioneered by the Honey Bee Network and National Innovation Foundation . 
By partnering with companies and colleges in India and abroad , our grassroots innovators will propel a different kind of globalization . 
The products and services based on grassroots knowledge and creativity will reach global markets in an affordable , accessible and accountable manner . 
The Union Minister of Science and Technology , Dr . Harshvardhan , is spearheading the scientific and technological strategies for an inclusive growth under the leadership of the Prime Minister , Shri Narendra Modi . 
The Make in India , Clean India , and Inclusive India , under which financial inclusion is of prime essence , needs a significant push . 
Many amongst you have shared your experiences about how your countries and institutions have made progress in the direction of inclusive innovation . 
I am also happy at the interest evinced by you to engage with stakeholders from India . 
Some of you will share your insights tomorrow as well . 
You may take this opportunity to give your valued suggestions for a strategic roadmap for India to become much more inclusive and innovative . 
I assure you of our highest consideration for your suggestions and ideas . 
An ‘Atal Innovation Mission’ as an Innovation Promotion Platform involving academics , entrepreneurs and researchers has been announced recently . 
It will draw upon national and international experiences to foster a culture of innovation , R & D and scientific research in India . 
The platform will also promote a network of world - class innovation hubs to address the grand challenges of our country . 
I call upon you to participate in the Indian development story , which will exhibit frugal and sustainable pathways for other countries and communities . 
In this era of globalization , the Indian innovations and development will not only benefit India but the rest of the world as well . 
he ingenious goods and services developed through inclusive innovation , and by blending affordability , accessibility , acceptability and availability , will have the potential to transform the global landscape . 
In the end , I do hope that your interactions with various innovators at this forum are productive and trigger long - term partnerships for peace , progress and prosperity in the world . 
I wish a pleasant stay to the visiting dignitaries from abroad . 
I invite you all to visit the Mughal Gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
I wish you the very best for the future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE EIGHTH NATIONAL PRESIDENTIAL BIENNIAL AWARD FUNCTION FOR GRASSROOTS INNOVATIONS AND OUTSTANDING TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATION EXHIBITION
I am indeed happy to be a part of this Presentation Ceremony of the Eighth National Presidential Biennial Award for Grassroots Innovations and Outstanding Traditional Knowledge . 
At the outset , let me congratulate all the award winners for their work and contribution in the field of innovation . 
I take this opportunity to also compliment the National Innovation Foundation ( NIF ) - India for unleashing the creative potential of the grassroots innovators and for championing the cause of inclusive innovation through its various initiatives . 
In particular , I would like to place on record my high appreciation for the outstanding contribution of Prof . Mashelkar and Prof . Anil Gupta in making innovation take the shape of a movement in our country . 
Innovation is the key to progress and prosperity . 
There are many social needs that public , private and civil society institutions have not been able to meet fully . 
At the same time , there is tremendous ingenuity amongst the people , which if tapped , could address the necessities of the common man . 
Much as the blooming of the spring , the innovations by local communities , students , farmers and others could bring smiles on the faces of millions of our people . 
The process of innovation converts knowledge into social good and economic wealth . 
It encourages the engagement of talent with the society to improve the quality of life . 
India always has had a strong tradition of knowledge . 
Our knowledge system offer tremendous scope for research involving land - to - lab investigation and lab - to - land transfer of technology . 
It is important that the vast repository of indigenous knowledge is protected , documented and preserved in active collaboration with prominent practitioners of traditional knowledge . 
Inclusive development is possible only when ideas and innovations of common people are supported whole - heartedly . 
Mid - way through this Decade ( 2010 - 20 ) of Innovations , we perhaps need to assess and if necessary recalibrate our approach towards harnessing the creativity of our grassroots innovators and students . 
Increasing the scalability of grassroots innovations necessitates a strong linkage between the invaluable knowledge bank prevalent in our society and the formal education system . 
To use our innovation potential for the greater good , the nodal governmental agencies must play an enabling role . 
Building viable linkages between formal and informal sectors also call for deepening the involvement of the leaders of technological , financial and educational sectors with the creativity of common people and young students . 
A Festival of Innovation has been started at the Rashtrapati Bhavan this year . 
It will help to provide a platform to bring different stakeholders together and make these entities active partners in inclusive innovation . 
The innovators participating in this programme have come from various parts of our country . 
I hope that an empathetic value chain for disseminating good ideas can be built upon this initiative . 
I am told that the Innovation Exhibition will showcase novel solutions to problems in multiple domains such as engineering , agriculture , health and other socio - economic sectors . 
These innovations are aimed at improving productivity and efficiency , and enhancing affordability and environmental quality . 
They provide a veritable impetus to the ‘Make in India’ mission in our country . 
Apart from developing appropriate linkages with investors , entrepreneurs and financial institutions , the Union and State governments should also consider taking up these innovations for wider diffusion through their administrative channels , particularly in economically backward regions , and tribal and remote areas . 
In this context , it is only appropriate that agricultural universities , public sector R & D laboratories , IITs and NITs are supporting the NIF in validating and value - adding grassroots technologies . 
Even then , NIF faces a potent challenge in scouting more women innovators and outstanding traditional knowledge holders . 
I am sure that with sustained effort , NIF will overcome these hurdles . 
Greater involvement of crucial stakeholders will provide the stimulus required for inclusive growth and development . 
India has the potential to be at the forefront of innovation . 
The encouraging steps in this direction notwithstanding , our country lags behind many others . 
India is ranked 76thin the Global Innovation Index 2014 , much below China which is at the 29thposition . 
Even Russia , at the 49th place and Brazil at 61 , performed better than us . 
The contribution of grassroots innovators and innovations by the MSME and the informal sector are considerable in our country . 
Yet , there are lessons to be learnt from others and experiences to be shared with countries and organizations , which have taken the lead in the field of inclusive innovation . 
I am glad to learn that this pertinent topic - inclusive innovations - will be the subject of round - table discussions today and tomorrow . 
I look forward to the summary of the deliberations today evening and I hope that the discussions with delegates from various countries will help India take this agenda forward . 
Through the conferences of vice chancellors of central universities and of directors of IITs and NITs , I have been urging our higher educational institutions to set up Innovation Clubs . 
These clubs are intended to be a platform for exchange of innovative ideas between the teaching and student communities , and grassroots innovators . 
These clubs are expected to sense the unmet social needs , and search , spread and celebrate grassroots innovations . 
Once these unmet needs are mapped , our pedagogy and research process could be reoriented suitably . 
The representatives of Innovation Clubs will meet here during this week to discuss their achievements and future strategies . 
This Festival will provide a forum to the faculty and student representatives to learn from the grassroots innovators about frugal and sustainable innovations . 
To promote and nurture the creative potential of our people , the Rashtrapati Bhavan has been opened for innovation scholars , writers , artists , scholars from NITs and inspired teachers . 
Today , the second batch of innovation scholars , writers and artists have joined us here for the In - Residence Programme . 
I welcome all of them to the Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
I hope that this Festival of Innovations will create synergy amongst these creative people . 
I once again applaud the award winners and call upon all the innovators present here to continue generating ingenious solutions to overcome poverty , create employment and make the society healthier , happier and harmonious . 
I wish the Festival of Innovations a great success . Let me conclude in the words of Albert Einstein : 
Concern for man and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors . 
Never forget this in the midst of diagrams and equations . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESIDENT’S STANDARD PRESENTATION TO 21 SQUADRON AND 116 HELICOPTER UNIT
It gives me immense pleasure to be here today at Air Force Station Jodhpur , one of the oldest and premier air bases of the Indian Air Force in the Rajasthan Sector , to award Standards to 21 Squadron and 116 Helicopter Unit . 
These distinguished flying Units have a glorious past and a rich tradition of professional excellence . 
Since their inception , they have rendered illustrious service to the nation and done us proud . 
Their rich heritage and stellar efforts in the pursuit of excellence have set a benchmark for others to emulate . 
For their selfless devotion , professionalism and courage in the face of adversity , the nation honours them today with a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation . 
The Indian Air Force has been fulfilling its role of protecting the Indian skies and safeguarding the sovereignty of our Nation , and has also provided aid to its citizens during natural calamities . 
The resilience and tenacity displayed by the Air Warriors is a great source of encouragement and a matter of pride for the Nation . 
The massive relief operations undertaken by the Indian Air Force in the past is etched in our memories . 
The nation is immensely proud of Indian Air Force and remains indebted to the air warriors for their selflessness and sacrifice . 
As a responsible nation , India is firmly committed to peace and stability for which we need an effective deterrence and a strong defence force . 
While the nation is striving for an all - round economic growth and social empowerment of its citizens , we remain equally focused on building our defence capability that safeguards our sovereignty and territorial integrity . 
Thus , the confidence inspired by the Armed Forces , for the nation to progress resolutely on the path of development is really praiseworthy . 
The Air Warriors , who stand before us today , epitomize grit and determination in fulfilling their responsibilities towards the Nation by upholding the highest standards of service ethos . 
I take this opportunity to congratulate all the Air Warriors on parade for their impeccable drill and smart turnout . 
21 Squadron known as the " Ankush” was formed in Ambala in October 1965 with Gnat Mk - I aircraft . 
The Squadron has actively participated in the1971 Indo - Pak war carrying out 108 Air Defence missions and was decorated with three Vayu Sena Medals . 
During " Operation Safed Sagar” in 1999 the squadron was handed over the responsibility to guard the Srinagar Valley . 
The commendable performance of the personnel of the squadron during various operations has been recognised and appreciated in the form of gallantry awards . 
Over the years the squadron has successfully operatedGnat Mk - I andMiG 21 aircraft , from nine different locations . 
The squadron has always lived up to its motto of " Siddhirvasti Sahase” which translates into ‘Success Lies in Courage’ and I am sure they will continue to excel in the times to come . 
116 Helicopter Unit has had a glorious operational record . 
It was formed in Sarsawa in August 1967 with Mi - 4 Helicopters . 
Later , the Unit has operated Chetak and recently , the Dhruv helicopter with distinction and accomplishment . 
This was also one of the first helicopter units to be equipped with Anti Tank Guided Missiles , thus assuming the name of ‘Tankbusters’ that the unit bears proudly till date . 
The unit undertook various operations in different roles like Casualty Evacuation , Logistic Support , Armed Reconnaissance and also operations in support of the Army . 
The Unit has carried out extensive flying on numerous occasions to bring relief to the stranded people and saved innumerable lives . 
Hence their motto " AAPATSU MITRAM”meaning " Friends in Distress” truly reflects the Unit’s noble and gallant involvement towards the conduct of relief and rescue operations . 
I am confident that the ‘Tankbusters’ will continue to grow from strength to strength in the years to come . 
In acknowledgement and recognition of their outstanding performance , I award Standards to 21 Squadron and 116 Helicopter Unit . 
On this occasion , I take the opportunity to compliment the personnel and families of 21 Squadron and 116 Helicopter Unit , both past and present , for their selfless service and dedication towards the nation . 
The nation is indeed proud of you . I wish you all the very best for a glorious future .

In this New Year full of aspirations and hope , I welcome you to the Joint Sitting of the Two Houses of the Parliament with the belief that your deliberations will be productive and useful . 
Dr . Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had said , " the greatest strength of India is her rich spiritual and civilizational heritage " . 
The core values of our civilization emphasize universal good - welfare of all human beings . 
The fundamental tenet of my Government isSabka Saath Sabka Vikas– All Together , Development of All . 
Within a span of nine months , my Government has articulated and embarked on a comprehensive strategy for unleashing the full potential of our country and its precious resource of 125 crore people .

A strong beginning has been made . A promising future awaits us . 
Poverty is a bane to dignified human existence . 
Development is actualized only when the last person gets a sense of fulfillment , especially , regarding his minimum needs . 
Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya had laid emphasis on holistic development of each and every human being - Ekatm Manavata darshan ( Integral Humanism ) . 
My Government is pledged to work for the welfare of the poor , the marginalized and the vulnerable sections of the society . 
Financial inclusion is critical to poverty elimination .

It gives me great pleasure to welcome His Excellency Mr . Maithripala Sirisena , President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka , First Lady Mrs . Jayanthi Sirisena , and the distinguished members of his delegation on his first State Visit to India . 
Allow me , Excellency , at the outset , to felicitate you on your electoral victory last month . 
It was an unequivocal expression from the Sri Lankan people for change , as well as a clarion call to pursue the path of harmony and genuine reconciliation . 
The reforms that your Government has initiated hold the promise of a better tomorrow for Sri Lanka and the region . 
As your immediate neighbour and the world ' s largest democracy , India takes pride in the strengthening of democracy in Sri Lanka , and stands ready to continue to extend all necessary support as Sri Lanka embarks upon a new chapter in its history . 
Excellency , the emerald isle that you come from , has from its ancient name of Serendipa gifted to the English language the word ‘Serendipity’ , a word which at once signifies a certain mystique as well as all that is pleasant . 
Sri Lanka occupies a special place in India ' s worldview . 
I would like to recall a couplet from the Tamil classic Thirukkuralon friendship which roughly translated into English means ‘True friendship is rare and hard to gain ; once achieved , it protects against unpredictable woes’ . 
The symbiotic relationship between India and Sri Lanka is not based merely on geography , which is compelling enough , but is also predicated on shared religions , cultural practices , family ties , linguistic commonalities , economic cooperation , political understanding , and much more . 
In a testimony to this fraternal bond between our two countries , we jointly celebrated the 150th anniversary of Swami Vivekanada in 2013 and of Angarika Dharmapala in 2014 . 
Not many would know that a Sri Lankan student of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore , Ananda Samarakoon , composed the Sri Lankan national anthem , " Sri Lanka Mata” . 
In contemporary times , our relations have become multi - faceted , encompassing trade and investment , science , education , security and defence , and above all , people - to - people exchanges . 
As two cricket playing nations , we rejoice as much in the achievements of Sanath Jayasuriya and Muthiah Muralidharan as we do in our own players . 
In terms of foreign tourist footfalls in Sri Lanka , India ranks number one . 
The first FTA that India signed with any country was with Sri Lanka . 
It is time to take our economic engagement to the next level . 
am also happy that we are promoting cooperation in the knowledge sector . 
There has been a resurgence in the Indian economy over the last year , and Sri Lanka is well - placed to take full advantage of this . 
We should look at steps to enhance connectivity between our two nations . 
India is privileged to be a partner in Sri Lanka ' s development efforts , focusing on capacity building , human resource development and infrastructure support . 
I am delighted that the flagship Indian Housing Project in Sri Lanka continues to make excellent progress . 
The recommencement of the iconic ‘Yal Devi’ train service , after three decades , between Jaffna and Colombo through the Indian - assisted Northern Railway Rehabilitation project is a matter of particular satisfaction . 
Sri Lankan investment in India has also seen some remarkable success stories in the garments sector . 
Excellency , your electoral victory has opened new opportunities for further strengthening our bilateral relations . 
We must build on our deep and enduring links of history and culture , and work towards the shared prosperity of the people of our countries and the region . 
A vast vista of cooperation beckons us . 
Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen , may I request you to join me in raising a toast –
- to the good health of His Excellency , President Maithripala Sirisena ; 
- to the continued progress and prosperity of the Sri Lankan people ; and
- to closer friendship and cooperation between India and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF RASHTRAPATI SCOUT / GUIDE / ROVER / RANGER AND ADULT LEADER AWARD CERTIFICATES FOR THE YEAR 2013
I am , indeed , very happy to be amidst you this morning and to welcome you to the historic Darbar Hall to participate in today’s award ceremony . 
The tradition of the Rashtrapati Award Certificates has continued since 1961 , when my illustrious predecessor , and the First President of India , Dr Rajendra Prasad , associated himself with The Bharat Scouts and Guides organisation . 
The due recognition of the highest achievers , at this award ceremony , has always inspired generations of scouts and guides towards giving their best for community - service and nation - building . 
The founding - father of Scouts and Guides , Lord Baden Powell , started the movement in our country in 1909 , a mere two years after the first experimental Scouting Camp at the Brown Sea Island in Great Britain . 
Being a voluntary , non - political and educational movement for young people , bereft totally of any distinction in terms of race or creed , the Scout / Guide Promise of ‘doing one’sdutyto God and Country , and service to fellow beings’will forever ingrain , in each one of you , the timeless virtues of mutual respect and universal brotherhood . 
Therefore , veritably , the participation in this movement enables all of you to realise your own intellectual , physical and spiritual potential . 
Today , I am especially happy to note that your dedication and purposeful activities , at such a tender age , are paving the way for national integration as well as international harmony in equal measure . 
I take this opportunity to convey my simple message to you all ; that , ‘the country stands proud of each one of you’ . 
My dear young friends , ladies and gentlemen , as the world becomes increasingly globalised , we are , only too aware of the rampant social conflicts that threaten the continued well - being of all citizens . 
Our nation is going through an unprecedented demographic transformation . 
In another five years’ time , the average age of an Indian would be 29 years ! 
The statistical fact is not only indicative of how important it is , for the country , to focus on the aspirations of our youth ; but equally , for each one of my young friends here , and across the country , to strive and become the much - needed ‘agents of change’ . 
The Bharat Scouts and Guides can be the perpetual platform to nurture leadership at the grassroots level , precisely as needed . 
I will like to draw your attention to the recently - launched ‘Swachch Bharat Abhiyan’ , the pan - India movement that is truly based on ‘dignity of labour’ , a value that was so dear to Mahatma Gandhi . 
It is my firm belief that The Bharat Scouts and Guides stands poised to inculcate the basic sense of self - confidence , self - reliance and passion for national duty in each and every one of you . 
Young friends , as a message of sagacity , I would only emphasise , that we must seek the measures to create a higher standard of social order . 
Each one of us must be mindful of the sensitivities of those around us , and the effect of our words and actions on them . 
We must collectively preserve the core values of pluralism and secularism that have served , over the years , to safeguard the fabric of our society . 
" The Bharat Scouts and Guides” must infuse a greater sense of tolerance in young minds , whilst allowing them to summarily reject any divisive agenda . 
It is with a sense of great satisfaction that I note the wide spectrum of activities The Bharat Scouts and Guides have been engaged in over the past years . 
The efforts and the events have encompassed humanitarian aid during natural calamities , social campaigns to combat disease and debilitative habits , community workshops for skill - development , joint activities related to Millennium Development Goals , and participation in international meets . 
I thank each and every member of the organisation for the selfless services rendered that not only bring succour to the deprived and the needy , but also enhance the reputation of our country in the eyes of the international community . 
Dear young friends , in the end , I would like to take the opportunity to underscore the apt words of the vision - statement of The Bharat Scouts and Guides , and I quote , ‘By 2024 , The Bharat Scouts and Guides will be a globally - visible , consistently - growing and self - reliant premium youth movement that is gender - balanced , vibrant and responsive to trends . ’
With these words , I once again , congratulate the award winners , including the Adult Leaders , of The Bharat Scouts and Guides . 
May your meritorious service be the lodestar for others to follow suit in the coming years .

In the last Conference of Vice Chancellors , we took a number of decisions . 
While I await a detailed analysis of the action taken report later today , a quick look at the progress made on these action points reveals a disappointing picture . 
The vacancy position remains alarmingly high - in terms of percentage , vacancies have increased from 37 . 3 percent as on Mar 31 , 2013 to 38 . 4 percent as on Dec 1 , 2014 . 
Performance is marginally better in setting up innovation clubs and inspired teachers’ networks . 
However , only four universities have so far established centres of excellence while another five are working towards these . 
Efforts aimed at engagement of central universities with industry and alumni need far greater focus and direction than at present . 
During this Conference , I would want you to devote considerable thought and effort on the successes , failures and difficulties in implementation of last year’s recommendations . 
The modified format of the Conference will enable you to collectively identify difficulties and evolve collaborative strategies towards overcoming these . 
Over the last two years , I have been insisting upon a rigorous follow - up of the decisions taken in these Conferences . 
Earnest efforts have been made to fulfil the commitments I made last year . 
Non - availability of Visitor’s nominees in the Selection Committee of faculty has been addressed . 
Consequent upon my approval , each Central University will now have a panel of five names of nominees who can be called as per extant instructions . 
As a short - term measure to overcome faculty shortage , engagement of eminent scholars and researchers , both from within the country and outside , was suggested in the last Conference . 
During my visit to Norway and Finland , where I was accompanied by an academic delegation from central universities , IITs and IISERs , I called upon academicians and experts to come and teach in India . 
Under the Global Initiative of Academic Networks ( GIAN ) , the HRD Ministry has asked you for a list of eminent scholars and researchers for inviting them as guest speakers or scholars . 
An e - platform needs to be developed to facilitate scholars from within and outside the country to log in their details . 
It shall , in due course , lead to creation of a robust database of global experts for the Indian higher education system . 
The recently - launched ‘Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching’ will set performance standards and create world - class facilities for innovative teaching . 
The Indian Constitution is the holy book of democracy . 
It is a lodestar for the socio - economic transformation of an India whose civilization has celebrated pluralism , advocated tolerance and promoted goodwill between diverse communities . 
These values , however , need to be preserved with utmost care and vigilance . 
The freedom inherent in democracy sometimes generates an unhappy by - product when political discourse becomes a competition in hysteria that is abhorrent to our traditional ethos . 
The violence of the tongue cuts and wounds people ' s hearts . 
Religion , said Gandhiji , is a force for unity ; we cannot make it a cause of conflict . 
Much is said about India ' s soft power . 
But the most powerful example of India ' s soft power , in an international environment where so many countries are sinking into the morass of theocratic violence , lies in our definition of the relationship between faith and polity . 
We have always reposed our trust in faith - equality where every faith is equal before the law and every culture blends into another to create a positive dynamic . 
Wisdom of India teaches us : unity is strength , dominance is weakness . 
The multi - nation conflict has converted boundaries into bloodlines , and turned terrorism into an industry of evil . 
Terrorism and violence are seeping across our borders . 
While peace , non - violence and good neighbourly intentions should remain the fundamentals of our foreign policy , we cannot afford to be complacent about adversaries who will stop at nothing to disrupt our progress towards a prosperous and equitable India . 
We have the strength , confidence and determination to defeat architects of this war against our people . 
Repeated violations of the ceasefire along the Line of Control and terrorist attacks must get an integrated response through incisive diplomacy and impregnable security mechanisms . 
The world must join India in fighting the menace of terrorism . 
Economic progress is also a test of democracy . 
Year 2015 is a year of hope . Key economic indicators provide for much optimism . 
Strengthening of the external sector , move towards fiscal consolidation , moderation in price levels , early signs of rebound in manufacturing and record agricultural production last year augur well for our economy . 
Achieving five percent plus growth rates each in the first two quarters of 2014 - 15 is a healthy sign for an early reversion to the high growth trajectory of 7 - 8 percent . 
The success of a society is measured by both survival and strengthening of its values , institutions and instruments of governance . 
Our national narrative has been shaped by the principles of its past , triumphs of today and is now ready to own the future by powering its latent potential . 
Our national ambition is to raise the quality of life of Indians by quantum leaps and raise generations enlightened by learning , patriotism , compassion , honesty and a sense of duty . 
Thomas Jefferson had said and I quote : " Educate and inform the whole mass of the people . . . They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty”
We must strive for the highest quality in our educational institutions so that we can take our place , within a visible future , among the knowledge leaders of the 21st century . 
I would urge , in particular , that we lay special stress on the culture of books and reading , which takes knowledge beyond the classroom and frees imagination from stress of the immediate and the utilitarian . 
We must be a creative people , nourished by innumerable , interlinked rivers of ideas . 
Our youth must lead the way to mastery of technology and communication in a universe where the cloud has become a library without frontiers , and vast opportunity awaits within the computer in your palm . 
The 21st century is within India ' s grasp . 
This future will remain both visible and elusive if we do not discover the ability to continually cleanse ourselves of retrograde habits and social ills . 
Over the past century , some have died , others have faded , but many still exist . 
We are celebrating , this year , the centenary of Gandhiji ' s return to India from South Africa . 
We can never cease to learn from a Mahatma . 
The first thing he did in 1915 was to keep his eyes open and his lips sealed . 
It is advisable to follow his example . 
While we are , rightly , focused on 1915 , perhaps we should cast a glance on what Gandhiji did in 1901 , the year when he returned home for his first break . 
The annual Congress session was held that year in Calcutta , then the capital of British India . 
Gandhiji was a delegate . He went to Ripon College for a meeting . 
He discovered that the whole place had been dirtied by fellow - delegates . 
A shocked Gandhiji did not wait for any allotted cleaner . 
He picked up a broom and cleaned the area . 
No one followed his example in 1901 . 
114 years later , let us follow his example , and become worthy children of a magnificent father . 
NEW YEAR ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE TO HIGHER EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS ON THE TOPIC , “PARLIAMENT AND POLICYMAKING” THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCING
Let me start by wishing you and your families a very happy and prosperous New Year . 
I am happy to have the opportunity of sharing some of my thoughts with you at the beginning of the year . 
I express my appreciation and gratitude to the National Knowledge Network ( NKN ) team , particularly Prof . S . V . Raghavan , and the NIC team , who have made it possible for me to reach out to you in such large numbers through this video conference . 
Last year , it was decided that I will address you twice – once at the beginning of the New Year in January and again at the beginning of the new academic session in August . 
The year 2014 was an eventful year for India’s polity . 
After three decades , Indian electorate decided to give a single party the majority to form a stable government . 
Outcome of the Elections to the 16thLok Sabha provides political stability and gives mandate to the elected government to fulfill its commitment to the people by using its majority in formulating policies and making laws to implement those policies . 
Distinguished heads of the institutions , faculty members and dear students : 
In a democratic polity , building and strengthening the nation is the collective responsibility of all the major organs of the government . 
In Parliamentary Democracy , all three wings - the Executive , the Legislature ( Parliament ) and the Judiciary - are the most important functional organs . 
All three derive their authority from the Constitution , which clearly defines their role of policymaking , legislation , implementation of the policies and programmes , and interpreting the law by Judiciary as and when required . 
Today , I have chosen to speak on the theme of " Parliament and Policymaking” or , more generally , on the relationship between law and policy . 
You would recognize that by posing the issue on those lines , the Judiciary , along with the Parliament and the Executive , also becomes a relevant player in steering the development process in the country . 
All three organs are expected to operate within their limits as prescribed by the Constitution without over - stepping them . 
In a democracy , the Parliament has three vital functions – representation , law - making and oversight . 
Though the formulation of policy and initiation of legislation is mainly the function of the Executive , enactment of legislation or its rejection is within the domain of the legislature . 
Interpretation of law falls in the domain of the Judiciary . 
The Parliament stands for the will and aspirations of the people . 
It is the platform where through debate and deliberations , this ‘will’ and ‘aspirations’ have to be prioritized and translated into laws , policies and concrete programmes of action . 
When that does not happen , an important element in the functioning of a democracy gets compromised to the disadvantage of the people . 
Law refers to principles and rules , codified or enshrined in customary practices , established for mediation of social relations between people and communities in a society . 
It serves two important purposes . It gives shape to social values and strengthens their aspirational dimension . 
It also helps in guiding human behaviour towards desired social ends . 
Thus , by definition , law provides the normative basis and the architecture for the conduct of public policy . 
Law - making or legislation is the exclusive domain of the Parliament and the legislative assemblies in our Parliamentary democracy . 
In law - making , the easy part is the act of passing a Bill ( not so easy when you do not have majority ! ) 
The harder part is the negotiations for reconciling the interests of different groups for the legislation . 
A legislature is effective only if it is able to address the differences amongst stakeholders and succeeds in building a consensus for the law to be enacted and enforced . 
When the Parliament fails in discharging its law - making role or enacts law without discussion , it breaches the trust reposed in it by the people . 
This is neither good for the democracy nor for the policies anchored in those laws . 
Policy refers to a definite course of action adopted for expediting or facilitating desired results in a given situation . 
It is normative in nature . 
These norms come from laws and social practices prevalent in a society , or from international conventions that a state becomes party to . 
Policies have to essentially address the concerns of different stakeholder in a society , in the larger national interest . 
The policymaking in India’s context is guided by its Constitution . 
The Directive Principles of State Policy represent affirmative instructions to provide the basis for all executive and legislative action . 
While these principles are non - justiciable , they are fundamental in the governance of the country . 
In the landmark 1973 Judgment inKesavananda Bharati vs . State of Kerala , theSupreme Courtobserved that both Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights are equally ‘fundamental’ even though Directives are not directly enforceable by the courts . 
In the past decade , people have been given entitlements for right to information , limited job security in rural areas , education and food through legal guarantees . 
Each legislative intervention has resulted in a shift in policy towards the objectives laid down in our Constitution and in furthering human well - being . 
The Parliament having aided policy formulation also ensures that policy and programmes that it has helped define through legislation is implemented in the envisaged manner . 
It exercises oversight , to ensure that programmes are carried out by the Executive legally , effectively and for the purposes they are intended . 
Parliamentary oversight extends also to two other important functions . 
Parliament enjoys exclusive power of total control on money and finance . 
Every taxation and every receipt and expenditure to and from the Consolidated Fund of India is subject to the approval of the Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha . 
The other important supervisory power of the Parliament over the Executive is that the highest Executive authority i . e . the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers function as long as they enjoy the confidence of the popularly - elected House and can be removed by a simple majority of the House through a motion of no - confidence . 
According to our Constitution , in certain exceptional circumstances , the Prime Minister can recommend to the President the dissolution of Lok Sabha when composition of the House is fractured and its functioning becomes erratic and in - cohesive . 
Therefore , these two very important functions of the Executive are subject to the total control of the popularly - elected House . 
The Parliament’s role in policy articulation , its implementation and oversight is critical . 
It is , therefore , incumbent on the Members of the Parliament to discuss and undertake adequate scrutiny of all business transacted in the House . 
Unfortunately , the time devoted by the Members in Parliament has been gradually declining . 
The first three Lok Sabhas had677 , 581 and578 sittings , respectively . 
Compared to that , the 13th , 14th and 15thLok Sabhas had356 , 332 and357sittings , respectively . 
We all should hope that the 16thLok Sabha reverses this trend . 
There is a growing tendency to resort to disruption as a means of Parliamentary intervention . 
Dissent is a recognized democratic expression , but disruption leads to loss of time and resources , and paralyzes policy formulation . 
The cardinal principle of Parliamentary Democracy is that the majority has the mandate to rule while opposition has the right to oppose , expose , and if the numbers permit , to depose . 
But , under no circumstances should there be disruption of the proceedings . A noisy minority cannot be allowed to gag a patient majority . 
To meet certain exigencies and under compelling circumstances , the framers of the Constitution deemed it necessary to confer limited legislative power upon the Executive by way of promulgation of Ordinances when the legislature is not in session and circumstances justified immediate legislation . 
The framers also deemed it necessary to impose certain restrictions on this extraordinary legislative power by constitutionally mandating replacement of such Ordinances within a timeframe by the legislators . 
Article 123 ( 2 ) provides that an ordinance must be replaced by a law not later than six weeks from the re - assembly of the two Houses . 
Article 85 further provides that six months shall not intervene between the last sitting of one session and the first sitting of the next session . 
Distinguished heads of the institutions , faculty members and dear students : 
India’s diversity and the magnitude of its problems require that the Parliament becomes a more effective platform to build consensus on public policies and a bulwark of our democratic ideals . 
The proceedings in Parliament must be conducted in a spirit of cooperation , harmony and purpose . 
The content and quality of debates should be of a high order . 
Maintenance of discipline and decorum in the House and observance of etiquette and decency are necessary . 
The Parliament must not yield its space for legislating and policymaking to mass mobilization and street - protests , for that may not always provide considered solutions to our problems . 
To retain the trust and faith of the people , the Parliament must enact laws to put in place policies that address the concerns and aspirations of the people . 
You as educators , researchers , opinion makers and future leaders have a role to play in contributing to improve the quality of policymaking and its implementation . 
Many amongst you will enter public life to serve the nation . 
Take time to decide before entering as it is never a short - term option . 
But having decided once , give your best . 
I conclude by once again wishing you all a very happy and fulfilling year ahead . 
Let this be a year of great opportunities and successes in all that you pursue . 
VIDEO MESSAGE BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE FOR THE FUNCTION ORGANIZED BY THE INFOSYS SCIENCE FOUNDATION TO AWARD THE INFOSYS PRIZE 2014
Good evening , distinguished trustees of the Infosys Science Foundation ; esteemed jury chairs , winners of the Infosys Prize 2014 and guests . 
I am happy to address this distinguished gathering and I congratulate the Infosys Science Foundation for instituting these awards which recognize and honour outstanding achievements of researchers and scientists across six categories . 
India , under the guidance of our first Prime Minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , adopted science and technology as a priority from the early days of our independence . 
The creation of institutions for research and higher education began from 1950 itself . 
As early as 1951 , the country decided to set up an Atomic Energy Commission which has enabled India build her own nuclear reactors . 
Soon , our space programme started enabling us to launch satellites into space . 
At the time of independence , our agriculture sector was under - developed and we were importer of food grains . 
The excellence of our scientists and toil of our farmers , together led to the Green Revolution of the sixties . 
Today , we are self - reliant in food and a major exporter of food grains . Such a transition has few parallels in human history . 
The years that followed have seen the emergence of strong Information Technology , Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical industries . 
A few months ago , we made history with the successful entry of the Mangalyaan into the Mars Orbit . 
India is the fourth in the world to reach the Mars . 
It is also the first to attain this goal in its very first attempt and at a cost of US $ 74 million , a fraction of the money spent by others . 
While these milestones are a matter of pride for the nation , they also remind us of the distance still left to cover . 
Science is one of the creative endeavours of human mind . 
It plays a vital role in the advancement of human life and is central to technological progress . 
A scientific culture must determine the choices and decisions made by individuals , societies and nations . 
Research endeavours must advance the realms of knowledge and improve the lives of the common man . 
It must bring about social , environmental and economic betterment of our people . 
I am convinced that India’s future is inextricably linked to the progress we can make in establishing strong foundations for scientific research within our country . 
I congratulate all the winners of the Infosys Prize 2014 and thank them for their contributions to the world of knowledge . 
I am confident that their achievements will inspire our youth to dedicate themselves to the service of science and society . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE LAUNCH OF THE MOBILE GOVERNANCE PROJECT , ‘KARNATAKA MOBILE ONE’
I am happy to be here this afternoon for the launch of ‘Karnataka Mobile One’ , the Mobile Governance project of the Government of Karnataka . 
I compliment the State Government for this pioneering effort of starting an integrated mobile - enabled services delivery system . 
This unique initiative , which I am told is the first - of - its - kind in the country , signals a new era in Governance . 
This Mobile Governance project will make available services like bill payments , traffic alerts , traffic fine payments and other utility services through the mobile phone . 
It will also enable access toSakala , the platform for time - bound delivery of services , as well as prompt redressal of grievances . 
It is commendable that Karnataka , which is a leading centre of IT , has cohesively merged technology , innovation and governance to create a novel process of citizen - government engagement . 
Good decision - making calls for pooling of knowledge , experience and views of all stakeholders including citizens . 
Recognizing this mantra of statecraft , Karnataka pursues the deepening of bond between the government and the governed . 
This , according to me , epitomizes the philosophy of governance that our ancient treatises likeBhagavat Gita , Arthashastra and Manusmritihad propounded . 
These treasured scriptures provided a prescription for governance based on collaborative system between government and citizens . 
Happiness of citizens is the foremost objective of a welfare state . 
It is the fulcrum on which rests it’s other goals . 
Driving its fulfilment calls for good governance that has such sacrosanct elements as adherence to rule of law , participatory decision - making , equity , inclusiveness , responsiveness , transparency and accountability . 
The Constitution of India is a model of good governance principles . 
The Preamble , the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy comprise the tenets of governance . 
They provide a reference point for value based governance of our country . 
Fundamental rights are essential for the development of personality of every individual and for the preservation of human dignity . 
TheDirective Principles of State Policyis a blueprint for good governance . 
Parliamentary enactments , and government policies and programmes have helped transform these directives into actionable points for governance . 
For instance , entitlements for food , education and job , backed by legal guarantees , have empowered citizens . 
Schemes for universal healthcare and education have shown good results . 
Recently , the Government has provided further boost to inclusive development through a slew of innovative schemes aimed at complete financial inclusion , provision of digital infrastructure , cleanliness campaign and creation of model villages . 
The key parameter of success of public programmes is the meeting of the expectations of people . 
In the context of good governance , it implies the availability of effective delivery mechanisms . 
Responsiveness in catering to the needs of the citizens is a challenge the public administration of our country has to deal with . 
The efficacy of public institutions depends on the delivery mechanism and the institutional framework of rules , regulations and procedures , which has to evolve continuously to respond to the changing times . 
. There is a pressing need , on the one hand , to improve organizational capabilities to cater to the increasing demand for services and improvement in the quality of service delivery , and on the other , to improve transparency and accountability . 
This underscores the need for innovative solutions based on technology . 
Late Carl Sagan , the astrophysicist , author and science communicator , had said and I quote : 
" We have arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology”
The ‘Aadhaar’ project was initiated providing every resident with a unique identification number aimed at improving delivery and easy access to benefits and services . 
The Direct Benefits Transfer Scheme launched in January 2013 leveraged the Aadhaar system to improve targeting , eliminate waste , usher in greater transparency , reduce transaction costs and enhance efficiency . 
This initiative demonstrated how good governance practices can be consolidated using suitable technology models . 
E - governance holds great promise for a quantum leap in governance standards . 
The need of the hour is to leverage India’s leadership position in ICT to introduce technology - intensive solutions for governance . 
Dramatic developments in the IT sector have transformed the society . 
It has created an eco - system for the Government to tap technology - enabled solutions for deployment in the area of governance for the benefit of the common man . 
Karnataka , for one , is an IT hub portraying a success story that has few parallels . 
It contributes to thirty percent of the total software exports of our country . 
Not only has the State created a conducive environment for the expansion of the IT sector , it has skilfully combined innovation and government vision to bring about reforms touching the lives of citizens . 
E - initiatives like Bhoomi , which is an on - line system for land records management ; Kaveri , which is a valuation and e - registration system of the Department of Stamps and Registration ; e - swathu , which is a software that lists properties in urban local bodies and that has now been integrated withKaveri ; and e - procurement have set governance benchmarks . 
Karnataka also has the distinction of being the first Indian state to have a dedicated secretariat for e - governance . 
I commend your passion to deploy technology in governance . 
In this context , I want to express my delight at having been associated with the demonstration of 3D holography , which is a cutting - edge technology . 
Mobile phone has revolutionized the communication system like none other . 
It has brought people closer , shrunk distance and alleviated geographic separation . 
The total number of mobile phone subscribers in India is 93 crore with a density of 75 percent . 
41 percent of the subscribers reside in rural areas . 
The monthly growth rate of mobile phone subscription of 0 . 76 percent in the rural areas is higher than the 0 . 55 percent in the urban areas . 
These numbers have significance from the policy perspective of governance . 
The ‘Digital India’ programme launched in August this year envisages the creation of a digitally - empowered society and knowledge economy by breaking the divide between digital ‘haves’ and ‘have - nots’ . 
One of the components of this programme is the availability of government services in real time from mobile platforms . 
It is in this context that I consider the ‘Karnataka Mobile One’ to be an initiative of great foresight . 
It is heartening to note that nearly five hundred G2C and over four thousand B2C services have been integrated into this platform and I am told more services are being on - boarded . 
This , to me , will translate into ‘meaningful governance’ and take e - governance to the next level . 
The name ‘Karnataka’ , according to one of its etymological strands , originated from ‘Karu - Nadu’ . 
True to its meaning ‘elevated land’ , I expect this State to continue pursuing its lofty goals . 
In a rapidly changing world , it is the learners , pioneers and doers who will usher in a new era for citizens . 
Through your endeavours , you have displayed that and I compliment you for the same . 
Do not rest on your laurels ; continue with your efforts to improve governance . 
With the thought that creativity in the present is essential to create a better future , I conclude . 
I wish you all good luck for a successful implementation of the mobile governance programme . 
Thank you , Jai Hind . 
It is estimated that there are about 1 , 100 qualified clinical neurologists in our country of which 36 percent work in the four metropolitan cities leaving many areas dependent on single neurologists . 
It is incumbent on our health sector to create adequate capacity in our medical colleges to churn out more specialists and perform cutting - edge research ; and expand infrastructure in our hospitals and healthcare centres for investigation and treatment . 
Faculty is the custodian of knowledge . 
Advances in medical sciences occur at lightning speed today . 
It is important that our medical schools undertake faculty development , up - grade the syllabi and review the horizon of their research activities . 
A thought that should seriously engage our attention today is the nature of health system that we ought to have in our country - a commercial , profit - driven system or a system conversant with the socio - economic conditions prevailing in our society . 
I feel medical institutions like yours have a pivotal role to guide our health sector . 
You have a responsibility to inculcate a humanistic approach in the minds of the young doctors and health professionals and orient them towards a value - based career in medicine . 
There are doctors who are desirous of undergoing higher studies in premier institutions abroad to acquire greater expertise . 
They should be encouraged . Yet at the same time , they have to remember that the nation has invested in their education . 
Wherever they go , they have to retain the sacred bond with their motherland . 
They have to be fired by the spirit of patriotism and a sense of social responsibility . 
I hope that your institution would lead by example and infuse the higher objective of selfless service to society in the rest . 
I once again compliment everyone associated with this noble venture and wish them the very best for the future . 
Let me conclude in the words of Mahatma Gandhi : 
" A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history”
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE ANNUAL CONVOCATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALCUTTA
I consider it my good fortune to be here this afternoon for the Annual Convocation of the University of Calcutta , an institution whose origin is near about synonymous with that of modern higher education in India . 
The Education Despatch of 1854 , also called the Wood’s Despatch , sent by the Court of Directors of the East India Company had suggested the establishment of Universities at Calcutta , Bombay and Madras . 
This University came into being when the legislative edifice – the University Act – was passed on January 24 , 1857 . 
The colonial rulers envisaged this institution to cater to the educational requirements of the nobility and upper classes of India . 
Yet , University of Calcutta in due course became the guiding light for revolutionary ideas and nationalistic pursuits . 
Speaking on the occasion of the Centenary Celebrations of this University in January 1957 , Dr . Rajendra Prasad had said and I quote : 
" The Calcutta University was associated with the Indian renaissance and the awakening of nationalism through its alumni…… I might say that the fountain - head of this nationalism was largely opened up by the products of this University”
Allow me a moment here to recollect my connection with this historic University . 
Suri Vidyasagar College , where I did my education , was then affiliated to this University . 
I also pursued a Law degree from the Department of Law . 
It is my good luck to have been associated with this esteemed Institution at a time when a young , free Indian nation was making rapid strides at national development . 
As you honour me today by conferring on me the Honoris Causa , I express my profound sense of gratitude to the University of Calcutta . 
I also thank the University for bestowing upon me the Asutosh Mookerjee Memorial Medal that was introduced a year ago to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of this towering personality of Indian education . 
Sir Asutosh Mookerjee was a man of great intellect , courage and exceptional administrative ability . 
Under his stewardship as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Calcutta , which he headed for five two - year terms , he transformed this institution into an important centre of learning and research . 
It is indeed a rare honour to be presented with a decoration instituted in his name . 
Dear graduating students : 
Let me congratulate you all on your success and achievement . 
You are richly deserving of the applause and admiration . 
Convocation signifies the culmination of the phase of formal education , which you have secured through labour , resolve and devotion . 
It also symbolizes the beginning of a new journey where the knowledge you have gained and the skills you have acquired will be put to sterner test . 
You will achieve success but at times you may face adversity . 
It is in mitigating those trying circumstances that you will prove your mettle . 
Your discipline , commitment and determination will help you navigate through the rough terrain . 
Remember that leaving this academic universe does not imply you having to forfeit any further learning , as there is knowledge to be gained anywhere , anytime ahead . 
Life rewards those who engage in life - long learning . 
Education supports two elemental objectives of human existence : proliferation of knowledge and formation of character . 
Higher education especially has a unique role to play in preparing the torch - bearers of tomorrow who will endeavour in different fields - from medicine to engineering , teaching , administration , business , politics and social service – to lead our nation to the high tables of global power . 
It is therefore incumbent on our seats of higher learning to mould the next generation by inculcating in them the core values of patriotism , honesty , responsibility , discipline , respect for pluralism , respect for women and compassion . 
In crafting socially - responsive behaviour , educational institutions ought to lead by example . 
They owe to the society a duty to pay heed to its needs and aspirations . 
They can do so by actively participating in social development through actionable programmes . 
The Government has recently initiated theSaansad Adarsh Gram Yojana to set up model villages having improved facilities , smooth access to rights and entitlements and wider social mobilization . 
The scheme also envisages financial inclusion , provision of digital infrastructure and cleanliness campaign . 
I have called upon the Central higher level institutions to adopt five villages each and transform them into model villages by providing solutions to problems using resource persons and expertise available . 
I urge this University to pioneer this drive in the adjoining areas . 
The standard of higher education determines the level of development of a nation and the quality of life of her citizens . 
Though our higher education sector has rapidly expanded over the last few years , we have less to trumpet about the quality of our institutes . 
None of our institutions are ranked in the top two hundred positions by reputed international surveys . 
While I believe that a few renowned Indian institutions can be better placed with a little more methodical approach , a vast majority of our institutions are mired in mediocrity . 
If we delve into our past , one could find seats of higher learning – Nalanda , Takshashila , Vikramashila , Valabhi , Somapura and Odantapuri – having dominated the world for eighteen hundred years beginning sixth century BC . 
Scholars from round the globe flocked to these ‘poles of knowledge’ . 
A different scenario is noticeable today . 
Many meritorious Indian students pursue their higher studies from foreign universities . 
Nobel laureates – Har Gobind Khorana ; Subrahmanyam Chandrasekhar ; Dr . Amartya Sen , who studied at the Presidency College ; and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan – did their graduate or post - graduate studies in Indian universities before they went abroad for higher learning . 
It is ironical that our higher education system , which is capable of producing world - class scholars , loses them to foreign universities . 
Up - gradation of physical infrastructure apart , we need to improve the quality of teachers and the learning capacity of students . 
I was a teacher before I entered public life . 
I know how gratifying it is , as a teacher , to give students the joy of learning ; to make them appreciate , reflect and differentiate the strands of thinking . 
I wish all those associated with this University the very best for the future . 
I also wish the students Godspeed in their endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE ELEVENTH CONVOCATION OF SYMBIOSIS INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY
I am happy to join you for this Eleventh Convocation of Symbiosis International University , a prominent centre of higher learning in our country . 
At the outset , let me thank all of you for inviting me to be a part of an occasion which is both joyous and revered . 
I congratulate all the graduating students who have , through industry and perseverance , achieved success in their chosen education streams . 
A long journey with a bigger task awaits these new graduates , who I am sure will pass muster with their ability , knowledge and foresight . 
I am also glad at this opportunity to visit Pune , a historical city closely associated with our independence movement . 
It is the land of freedom fighters and social reformers like Bal Gangadhar Tilak , Veer Savarkar , Gopal Krishna Gokhale , Maharishi Karve and Mahatma Jyotiba Phule . 
Pune , over the years , has made tremendous progress in terms of industrial development and socio - economic change . 
It hosts major players in automobiles , IT and engineering sectors . Pune has established itself as an education hub . 
Commonly referred to as the ‘Oxford of the East’ , it has become a popular destination for students from different parts of the country and abroad . 
Symbiosis , established in 1971 with the motto ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’which means ‘the world is one family’ , has considerable number of students from outside . 
Of its 44 institutions , 28 fall within the Symbiosis International University that was established in 2002 . 
This University offers over 14 , 000 students 107 programmes in streams like management , computers , health , media , humanities and engineering . 
Symbiosis has transformed the fortunes of thousands of students . 
I applaud Dr . S . B . Majumdar , the Founder President , and his team for the progress Symbiosis has achieved through the years and urge them to continue moving ahead with the same vigour and vision . 
High economic growth is central to a developing country like ours as it is a panacea for ills like poverty , deprivation and backwardness . 
Creation of growth is increasingly happening through knowledge - based sectors . 
Given that knowledge will spur greater progress in the future , it is critical for us to prepare a pool of skilled and capable manpower by focusing on education . 
A country can neglect education at its own peril . 
The challenge of providing education with exacting standards to meet the growing aspirations of the youth , more so in a country of our size , is daunting . 
Having said that , we have been firm in our determination to develop the higher education sector . 
A credible set - up comprising 723 universities and over 37 , 000 colleges is in place . 
We are deficient , though , in terms of good quality institutions . 
No Indian institution is ranked amongst the top 200 universities in the world as per reputed surveys , though I believe , a few of our leading institutions can do better through a systematic and proactive approach . 
In the past , our seats of higher learning like Nalanda , Takshashila , Vikramashila , Valabhi , Somapura and Odantapuri were global leaders for eighteen hundred years beginning sixth century BC . 
These universities attracted scholars from round the world . 
Today , instead , bright Indian students – around two lakh every year – go abroad seeking higher education . 
It is a matter of introspection as to how we can bring our centres of higher learning back into the fold of leading institutions in the world . 
Our academic institutes have to be dynamic and hands - on in facing emerging challenges . 
Students today , far from being passive recipients of education , are active demand centres gradually seeking to re - define knowledge requirement . 
t . Institutions of higher education have to promote a culture of excellence and develop core competencies . 
They have to expand capacity to cater to more students and at the same time uphold the quality of instruction . 
They have to resort to technology tools like e - classrooms and knowledge networks to enable sharing of ideas and intellectual resources like lectures and tutorials . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF NATIONAL AWARDS FOR THE EMPOWERMENT OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
It is indeed a pleasure for me to be present amidst you on the occasion of presentation of the National Awards for the Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities . 
Today , is a significant day in the sense that on this day the United Nations General Assembly , by a Resolution in 1992 , had proclaimed the observance of this day as the International Day of Disabled Persons . 
The main objective of this initiative was to promote a worldwide understanding of the issues connected with disability and mobilize support for the dignity , rights and well - being of disabled persons . 
It was felt that such worldwide focus would encourage proactive efforts of the international community for the integration of the disabled in every aspect of political , social , economic and cultural life . 
It is entirely appropriate that the people of India should mark this date by honouring the selfless individuals among us and the altruistic organisations in our country who have generously worked for the empowerment of the disabled in our society . 
Today we recognize them for their contribution , and the time , resources and energies that they have dedicated to bring positive change in the lives of the differently abled persons . 
I congratulate them and deeply appreciate their humanity . 
Ladies and gentlemen , it is important to acknowledge that although we , as a people , have been conditioned by our religion and values to be especially mindful and sensitive to the needs of the differently abled , and although our Government has taken a number of measures to systematically address the challenges that they face , we still have a lot to do to facilitate them in their daily lives . 
Our Constitution , no doubt , guarantees the equality , freedom , justice and dignity of all individuals , including Persons with Disabilities . 
Our main law , " The Persons with Disabilities ( Equal Opportunities , Protection of Rights and Full Participation ) Act” of 1995 , provides very specific entitlements to Persons with Disabilities . 
Government of India has introduced a Bill forRights of Persons with Disabilities in Parliament . 
However , besides refining our policy framework , it is essential for us to reinforce our efforts to put better delivery mechanisms in place . 
In this context , one of the key instruments is education . 
Children with disabilities should have access , from the very beginning of their school lives , to the best possible educational opportunities that will enable them to cope with their disability and overcome any lack of confidence . 
Government has taken the necessary steps by providing scholarships for students , creating effective teaching - learning conditions , providing material in appropriate format and facilitating the access of the disabled to educational technology and equipment that is updated and appropriate . 
I would emphasize that special training of teachers is essential to enable them to be tuned to the needs of children with disabilities and guide them effectively . 
Government is also paying due attention to designing public facilities and services to make them " disabled friendly” . I am glad that Government of India has recently revised its scheme of Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase and Fitting of Aids and Appliances . 
The new scheme includes more devices that can be provided to students and other categories of persons with disabilities . 
I would also like to underline the significance of economic empowerment of the differently abled . 
Government has reserved positions for them and the private sector has launched similar initiatives . 
Both the public and private sectors should be partners in improving the skills of persons with disabilities and enhancing their employability . 
Many differently abled children are deprived from participating in games and activities that other children consider an integral and enjoyable part of their childhood . 
Women with disabilities feel particularly disadvantaged . 
Elderly disabled persons , in the twilight of their lives , are the most vulnerable . 
We need to involve people like these in more social and cultural activities where they can participate as per their ‘different’ abilities . 
The value of early detection and effective intervention cannot be emphasised enough . 
A number of simple precautionary steps can mitigate the effect of illnesses and chronic conditions that create disabilities - particularly in children in the susceptible age groups . 
Immunization , disease prevention , better hygiene , sanitation and nutrition , and access to healthcare and comprehensive maternal and neonatal care are the areas where we should apply ourselves with vigour . 
I would also highlight the useful role that the media can play - of focusing attention on the challenges and issues confronting the disabled and reminding the public of their duty to them . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , many among us must be wondering what they can do to make a difference : to them I would quote the words of Swami Vivekananda who said , " Arise , awake , sleep no more ; within each of you there is the power to remove all wants and all miseries . 
Believe this , and that power will be manifested . 
I would remind each one of you to recognise that there is a great potential within each differently abled man , woman or child . 
It is our duty , as a progressive society , to empower them to fully realize it . 
As I leave this thought with you , I once again congratulate all the National Award winners and convey to them my best wishes for the success of their endeavours . 
I am confident that they will continue to lead and inspire us , by their example , to work for a better life and future for the differently abled . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE on the Occasion of the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya
I am delighted to be amongst you today at the inauguration of the Golden Jubilee function of the Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya . 
The Mahavidyalaya was set up in 1964 by the then Chief Minister of Odisha , the late Biju Patnaik , an ardent lover of Odishan art and culture . 
I am happy to learn that the Mahavidyalaya is imparting education in the field of music , dance and drama from the plus two level to the post - graduate level in thirteen different streams such as Odishi vocal , Hindustani vocal , Odishi dance , Odishi pakhawaj , Hindustani violin , the flute and the sitar . 
The Mahavidyalaya is now affiliated to the Council of Higher Education at the plus two level and to the Utkal University of Culture at the graduate and post - graduate levels and is awarding degrees like any other Indian University . 
I am particularly happy to note that over the years this great institution has been living up to its vision of popularisation and dissemination of Odishan art and culture . 
The Gurus appointed since inception such as late Singhari Shyam Sunda Kar , late Shri Pankaj Charan Das , late Smt . Sanjukta Panigrahi , Dr . Bidut Kumari Choudhury and Shri Umesh Chandra Kar have been legends who have not only excelled in Odishan art and culture but have also been instrumental in propagating it throughout the world . 
Not surprisingly , the disciples who have emerged from the Mahavidyalaya such as Dhirendranath Mallick , Bhabani Charan Biswal , Subrat Pattnaik , Illian Citaristi and the late Gangadhar Pradhan have created a distinctive identity for themselves in the field of the performing arts . 
I am deeply appreciative of the efforts made by the Mahavidyalaya to keep alive Odishan art and culture . 
As you are aware , India is one of the oldest and culturally rich civilisations in the world . 
It is , therefore , only natural that performing arts have been an integral part of Indian identity and culture . 
They display amazing depth , richness and diversity developed over several millennia . 
Traditionally , these arts found patronage and flourished under enlightened rulers who themselves , at times , were great exponents of music and dance . 
This system of royal patronage of the arts , however , broke down during the colonial period . 
By the turn of the 20thcentury , classical music and dance in India witnessed a host of changes and re - inventions . 
The most important of these were that the masters of the performing arts were now seeking to find patronage for them beyond the traditional historical domain . 
This essentially meant spreading the performing arts to practitioners and audiences outside of the traditional families and communities that had been the repositories of these art forms in pre - colonial times . 
These new impulses resulted in India rediscovering its culture in a manner and scale not previously seen . 
The introduction of the gramophone , the radio and later on , cinema served to further popularise these classical music and dance forms across India . 
State funding of the performing arts was instituted by the Government of India post - independence and three national Akademis were set up in the early 1950s for documenting and disseminating knowledge of these art forms as also for their training and performance . 
Setting up of institutions like the Bhatkhande Music Institute , Lucknow and the Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya , Bhubaneshwar is a continuation of this tradition wherein the State funds and promotes various forms and aspects of Indian art , music , dance , drama and culture - inherent in this is the realization that our classical arts are our link with the past and , thus , both the foundation for our current thought and the platform for our future action . 
It is a matter of great satisfaction that the Mahavidyalaya has over the years lived up to the expectations that it had set for itself . 
I am confident that this great institution and its students will continue to excel in the performing arts . 
I once again take this opportunity to congratulate all of you on the occasion of the golden jubilee celebrations of the Mahavidyalaya and wish you all the best in your future endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF INAUGURATION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NEUROSCIENCES
It is a joyous occasion for me to be here this evening to inaugurate the Institute of Neurosciences , which is a state - of - the - art facility for Neurology , Neuro - surgery , Neuro - rehabilitation and Neuro - psychiatry . 
At the beginning , let me compliment the collaborators of this project – the Department of Health and Family Welfare , Government of West Bengal ; Kolkata Municipal Corporation ; and Neurosciences Foundation Bengal ( NFB ) – for having undertaken this difficult task of developing a super - specialty hospital for Neurosciences in Kolkata . 
I particularly applaud the Non - Resident Indian doctors of Bengali origin - Doctors Robin Sengupta , Chandranath Sen , Abhijit Guha and others - who have worked tirelessly and with vision under the aegis of NFB . 
This Institute started out - patient services in 2009 . 
It began in - patient services with 50 beds , a year later . 
I am happy to learn that neuro - scientists at this Institute are engaged in a collaborative effort with the Institute of Neurosciences , University of Newcastle , UK , to find solutions for Parkinson’s disease , motor neuron disease , gait disorders and dystonia . 
Neuroscience is one of the important disciplines in biological and behavioural sciences . 
Its scope has vastly increased to include experimental and theoretical analyses of the nervous system . 
The last few decades has seen substantial work being carried out to grasp the brain mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels . 
Speaking about the need for a much deeper knowledge of the brain , Late Rita Levi - Montalcini , the 1986 Nobel Prize Winner in Medicine had said and I quote : 
Scientific and technological research , from molecular to behavioural levels , have been carried out in many different places but they have not been developed in a really inter - disciplinary way . 
Research should be based on the convergence of different inter - connected scientific sectors . 
Neuroscience today is a distinct medical subject comprising basic neuroscience streams like neuro - anatomy , neuro - physiology , neuro - chemistry , neuro - pharmacology and neuro - pathology , as well as specialties like neuro - imaging , neuro - endocrinology , neuro - oncology and neuro - immunology . 
This holistic approach to neuroscience is essential to establish a credible healing system in a world - wide scenario of rising neurological disorders . 
Demographic change from youthful to an older population has taken place on account of increased life expectancy and reduced fertility . 
The resultant ageing of the population has caused a rise in neurological disorders like dementia and Parkinson’s disease that are pre - dominantly associated with the aged . 
Globally , about one billion people are affected by neurological disorders and the number is only going to swell in the years to come . 
Neurological disorders contribute to 6 . 3 percent of the global burden of disease . 
Disability - adjusted life years , which indicate the loss in future stream of healthy life due to incidence of disease , is a metric to comprehend this burden . 
The burden of neurological disorders , which was 92 million disability - adjusted life years in 2005 and estimated at 95 million in 2015 , is projected to rise to 103 million by 2030 . 
If comprehensive action is not initiated with due seriousness , the burden of neurological disorders will continue to increase and pose an even greater challenge for public health managers in the future . 
Neurological disorders lead to long - term disability and cause emotional suffering . 
Due to lack of social understanding , there is sometimes a stigma that is unfortunately associated with such incidences . 
This dissuades sufferers from seeking treatment . 
Efforts have to be made to preserve the dignity of patients and prevent their isolation through social integration . 
For that , public education and awareness campaigns involving all stakeholders are necessary . 
In some neurological disorders , care revolves around the family support system . 
For instance in India , where the incidence of dementia over the age of 60 years is about 1 . 9 percent , 50 percent of the carers are spouses . 
At the same time with socio - economic change taking place , family structures have evolved from joint to nuclear system resulting in greater dependence on private medical care , thereby leading to higher out - of - pocket expenses . 
The health insurance system has to be revamped to take care of the special needs of the aged . 
Immunization programme has been found to be an effective intervention for preventing neuro - infections . 
For that to really happen though , mobilization through public awareness and sensitization through grassroots health functionaries are necessary . 
Neurological disorders sometimes result in disability . 
This has to be addressed through suitable rehabilitation policies and programmes in wide - ranging sectors like education , employment and social development . 
Many neurological disorders are responsive to inexpensive yet effective treatment . 
Such interventions could thus be managed on a mass scale through the primary healthcare system . 
As per a report , 70 percent of epileptic patients could become seizure free with the drug Phenobarbital . 
In reality though , 80 percent epileptic patients in low income countries remain untreated on account of lack of drugs and trained personnel . 
A robust primary health service aided by secondary and tertiary health sectors , with specialists to diagnose and suggest remedial action , is necessary . 
Students are the core of our educational institutions . 
They are the ripening fruits of their intellectual enterprise . 
The students of today would be engaged in their lifetime in jobs that perhaps do not even exist now . 
They have to be taught critical skills and transferable competencies . 
They have to be infused with qualities like creative - thinking and problem - solving . 
They have to be encouraged in their quest to unearth the hidden and to experience the joy in discovering the unknown . 
They have to be trained to possess a universal mind - set to enable them to interact in the melting pot of an ever more globalized world . 
Our higher academic institutes would do well to provide exposure of foreign institutions to their students . 
In this regard , I am happy to learn that this University has innovative programmes like Global Immersion , Semester Exchange and Dual Degree through collaborations with over thirty foreign institutions . 
Faculty development is another important area for focussed attention . 
To keep pace with the information boom as well as continual refinements in disciplines , the faculty have to be trained in content and modern pedagogies . 
They have to be encouraged to attend seminars and workshops , and publish research papers . 
Research and innovation is the cornerstone of any academic endeavour . 
Their spin - offs could be large and immensely beneficial to a wide spectrum of the society . 
It is innovation due to which industrial enterprises show high growth momentum and keep themselves ahead of their competitors . 
As per a 2014 international survey , there are five Indian firms amongst the world’s hundred most innovative companies . 
We have to strive harder . 
Our academic institutions and industry have to engage with one another and benefit mutually from partnerships in joint research , curriculum development , and setting up of chairs , incubation centres and research parks . 
A sweeping up - gradation of India’s higher education sector calls for deepening of private sector involvement . 
Leading global universities like Harvard , Yale and Stanford have evolved out of private sector initiative . 
India’s private sector is engaged in several key areas like health , transport and financial services . 
In education too , private institutions play an important role as they account for nearly sixty per cent of total enrolment at the tertiary level . 
Yet at the same time , a disparity exists in the educational standards of the private system . 
Measures are therefore necessary to ensure better service delivery , benchmark and excellence . 
It is gladdening to note that this University , withan ‘A’ grade accreditation , has demonstrated its ability to deliver quality education . 
Higher level institutions have a larger role to play in the society . 
Their engagement with social issues has to be at a much deeper level . 
Some major initiatives aimed at inclusive development have been launched recently . 
The Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana envisages the adoption of villages for holistic development and their transformation into model villages for wider replication . 
I have urged Central higher educational institutes to work with at least five villages . 
I call upon your Institution to also take active part in this programme . 
Before concluding , I would like to tell my young friends what Aristotle had once said ; I quote : " Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all” . 
Your education should make you reflect inwards and help you engage with the world better . 
Never gauge success in the scales of money . 
Your success will be in the number of lives you will touch ; in the positives you will help usher in the society . 
It is human nature to seek truth and happiness . 
These should be your barometers of pursuit . 
I once again thank all of you for showering on me your warmth and affection . 
I wish you all best of luck for the future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH SCIENCE CONFERENCE
I am happy to participate in the inaugural ceremony of the Commonwealth Science Conference being organized by the Royal Society for the first time in India . 
The Royal Society is one amongst the great science academies of the world . 
It is not only one of the oldest but also an academy with a great history of accomplishments . 
The Royal Society has represented quality and defined directions in science for long decades . 
For a person to be elected Fellow of the Royal Society is a signal achievement and honour . 
Many of independent India ' s best scientists have been elected Fellows . 
A star amongst them is Professor C . N . R . Rao , one of the principal organizers of this meeting . 
India is particularly proud of Prof . Rao and his contributions to science and institution building . 
In recognition of his services to science and the nation , he was awarded earlier this year , our highest civilian honour - the Bharat Ratna . 
It is wonderful that Bangalore , India ' s IT hub and home to many scientific institutions is host to this Commonwealth Science Conference . 
I understand that several of the more recent Fellows of the Royal Society from India are from Bangalore’s Indian Institute of Science and the Tata Institute’s National Centre for Biological Sciences . 
The headquarters of the Indian Space Research Organization , whose scientists are the pride of India is also located here . 
The ISRO ' s most recent achievement of Mangalyaan or mission to Mars has been described by the Time magazine as one amongst the top 25 inventions of the year and something which portends well not just for our space programme but for science in general . 
India is the fourth in the world to reach the Mars . 
It is also the first to attain this goal in its very first attempt and at a cost of US $ 74 million , a fraction of the money spent by others . 
The Commonwealth is a unique international organization . 
It straddles the North - South divide in the world with an immense diversity of races , religions , cultures , geographical spread and stages of development . 
The bulk of its membership comes from 31 small states with a population size of 1 . 5 million or less . 
The larger member states at the same time share many similarities with them . 
Thus , the Commonwealth is a very useful forum for dialogue , promoting understanding on global issues and forging consensus on international action . 
India is a founding member of the Commonwealth and its largest member state , being home to nearly 60 % of the total population of the association . 
India is the fourth largest contributor to Commonwealth budgets and programmes . 
It is second only to the UK in providing technical experts to Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation for the purpose of extending assistance to developing Commonwealth countries . 
India is strongly committed to the fundamental values and principles of the Commonwealth . 
It believes the Commonwealth , has the potential to play an even greater role in relation to contemporary challenges facing the world and can be a bridge builder between the developing and developed countries . 
It is our view that the Commonwealth , with its diverse membership and democratic style of functioning based on consensus and informality , is well placed for global advocacy on contemporary issues . 
It is therefore important that all Commonwealth countries get together not only to discuss contemporary issues related to science and technology but also to explore how best science can be used to address the pressing challenges that confront humanity . 
India , under the guidance of our first Prime Minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , adopted science and technology as a priority from the early days of our independence itself . 
The creation of new educational and research institutions began from 1950 itself . 
As early as 1951 , the country decided to set up an Atomic Energy Commission which has enabled India build her own reactors . 
The space programme was also soon started enabling us launch rockets and satellites into space . 
At the time of Independence , our agriculture sector was under - developed and we were a net importer of food grains . 
It is the synergy between science and public policy which resulted in technologically upgrading our agriculture system . 
The excellence of our scientists and toil of our farmers , together led to the Green Revolution of the sixties , which made our country self - reliant in food and also , a major exporter today . 
Such a transition has few parallels in human history . 
In the years that followed , India based research led to the emergence of a strong pharmaceutical industry followed by more recently the Biotechnology and Information Technology industries . 
We in India see our future as inextricably linked to the progress we can make in the field of science and technology . 
ICT and the digital revolution is rapidly transforming our lives . 
The number of mobile phone users in India was around 930 million at the end of September 2014 which is the second highest in the world after China . 
Our mobile phone density of 74 . 55 compares favourably with other top ranking countries . 
India also ranks third after China and the USA in terms of number of internet users . 
At the same time , the penetration of internet use as a percentage of our population is only around 19 . 2 % at present indicating the huge potential that exists for further growth . 
The Parliament of India adopted in 1958 a science policy resolution which promised to " foster , promote and sustain” science in all its aspects . 
In 2013 , a Science , Technology and Innovation Policy was initiated by the Government aiming to shape the future of an aspiring India . 
Today , we are determined and committed to continued investment in basic science even as we use science to transform our society . 
Indian scientists were proud partners in the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle in 2012 . 
The Indian scientific community has been also part of projects such as the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research ( FAIR ) , Darmstadt , Germany ; Macromolecular crystallography and high pressure physics beam line at the Elettra Synchrotron Facility , Trieste , Italy ; Neutrino Experiments at Fermilab , USA ; the Thirty Metre Telescope ( TMT ) Project at Mauna Kea , Hawaii ; the Square Kilometre Array ( SKA ) Project , South Africa and Australia ; and experiments at the LargeHadron Collider ( LHC ) at CERN , Geneva . 
We hope to soon also launch international collaborative programmes in disease biology , marine biology and bioinformatics . 
Nanoscience and Technology is another area of focus . 
An umbrella programme , called the ‘Nano Mission’ has been launched to promote research and development in this emerging and active area . 
India today is placed third in the world in terms of scientific publications in this area . 
The ' Nano Mission ' is a good case study as to how capacity and capability in a specific field of Science can be strengthened through focused Government initiative . 
Professor C . N . R . Rao has led this successful effort . I take this opportunity to congratulate him for this wonderful initiative . 
Many new initiatives are also on the anvil in the fields of solar energy , electric mobility , high - energy physics , astronomy , vaccines and drug discovery , marine biology etc . , to name only a few . We hope to focus in the future on three types of scientific efforts : 
Blue sky research dealing with the important developments in fundamental science , including advanced materials and medical biology . 
Research and development related to man’s pressing problems such as water and diseases specific to India . 
Areas where India can emerge as one of the leaders in the world . 
We hope to identify such areas and support them adequately . 
I understand building scientific capacity in developing nations is one of the important topics which will be discussed in this Conference . 
I am also happy to learn about the initiatives the Royal Society is taking to stimulate science in Africa . 
The collaboration of young scientists from Commonwealth countries with leading laboratories of the world must be enhanced . 
There is also need to improve teaching and teacher quality at every level , especially schools . 
I believe this Commonwealth Science Conference can be transformative for our future if concrete programmes of action can be evolved in these areas . 
I understand one of the goals of this Conference is to recognize and encourage young scientists . 
I also see that young scientists have been invited to participate in the meeting and present papers . 
The attraction of talented students to study science and pursue a career in science is a big challenge in many developing countries and indeed the world over . 
Young boys and girls from every social and economic context from every corner of the world must have the opportunity to learn the rigorous tools of science to fulfill their dreams to understand the mysteries of our planet and the universe . 
I am happy to inform you of a major initiative of my Government in this regard called the Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research scheme or INSPIRE which is being implemented through our Ministry of Science & Technology . 
Over the past five years , more than a million students have been provided awards from which more than 230 innovations are being processed for provisional patenting . 
Commonwealth nations must join hands in bilateral and international ‘Mega Science’ initiatives . 
Because of their scale and technical complexity , such ‘Mega Science’ projects are manifestly multi - agency , multi - institutional and , most often , international in character . 
I encourage the Royal Society to develop programmes of international collaboration which could stretch from the West Indies to Australia , with support from national funding agencies and private philanthropy . 
Together , the brilliant intellects gathered in this room can promote science and the scientific method to young people worldwide and make the world a better place . 
India would be happy to collaborate in whatever manner possible , especially to strengthen the scientific base and research capabilities of the smaller countries of the Commonwealth . 
Science is one of the creative endeavours of human mind . Science seeks universal and fundamental truths . 
Science plays a vital role in the advancement of human life and its study is central to technological progress . 
Modern societies and nations must be built on scientific knowledge . 
A scientific culture and logic must determine the choices and decisions made by individuals , societies and nations . 
Let me conclude quoting Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru . 
Who often pointed out : " The future belongs to science and to those who make friendship with science” . 
I call upon all of you gathered here to do your utmost to ensure that the Commonwealth Science Conference acts as a platform for the flowering of ingenious ideas that benefit the common man . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE FIRST CONVOCATION OF NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY , ARUNACHAL PRADESH
It is my privilege to attend the First Convocation of the National Institute of Technology ( NIT ) , Arunachal Pradesh , one of the ten NITs established after 2006 - 07 . 
I am also happy at the opportunity to once again visit this beautiful state , whose pristine beauty and sylvan surroundings make it the ‘nature’s treasure trove’ . 
Its songs , dances and crafts only add to the magnificence of this place . Arunachal is a historical land finding mention in ancient scriptures like Kalika Purana and Mahabharata . 
It is an important centre of pilgrimage with the Tawang Monastery and Parasurakund located here . 
Arunachal Pradesh is in the throes of socio - economic change , aided by development in sectors like hydro - electric power and tourism . 
A facilitator to this transformative process is education , which has received considerable impetus . 
NIT Arunachal Pradesh was set up in 2010 . 
It has since progressed swiftly , overcoming the difficulties that crop up in the nascent stage . 
With 35 faculty members and 400 students enrolled in programmes ranging from graduation to PhD levels , it offers mainstream engineering disciplines as well as emerging subjects . 
Despite operating from a temporary campus , this Institute has made best efforts to maintain the quality of instruction . 
I compliment the management and faculty of NIT Arunanchal Pradesh for their energy , dynamism and commitment in steering this Institute most admirably in its formative years . 
This Institute has reached a major milestone today as the first batch of students has been awarded their degrees . 
I congratulate the new graduates , who by their dint of labour and perseverance have reached this culminating stage . 
You are now ready to step into the world outside your academic institution . 
I am sure you will make the best use of the knowledge you have gained here to attain professional success . 
Remember that you will have the occasion to learn at every stage of life . Never miss this opportunity . 
Mahatma Gandhi had said and I quote : " Live as if you were to die tomorrow ; learn as if you were to live forever” . 
You are going to be a part of the country’s scientific manpower , which is a crucial constituent of our developmental framework . 
It is incumbent on you to lend your hand in meeting the challenges of growth and industrial development . 
I am confident that you will more than fulfill the responsibilities entrusted upon you . 
A great responsibility is also on our engineering institutions , most notably the IITs and NITs , to produce socially conscious and professionally competent personnel who can take an aspirational India to greater heights . 
They would do well to not only equip our budding engineers and scientists to address contemporary issues with innovative solutions , but also inculcate in them an understanding of our society . 
Beyond the academic domain , our higher educational institutions including the NITs have a larger role to play in society ; in the progress of the regions in which they are based . 
They have to establish connection with stakeholders , identify problems hindering the development of the regions , and use their academic and research expertise to find solutions . 
In the Conference of NIT Directors held in Rashtrapati Bhavan last month , I had called upon the NITs to adopt five villages each and convert them into model villages in line with the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojanalaunched recently . 
I am confident that central institutions like NITs will spur the development of our nation through the collective development of her regions . 
A number of institutions have been started over the last few years to cater to the growing demand for engineering education in the country . 
Quality though has failed to keep pace with the expansion in quantity . 
While we have a few reputed engineering institutions , it is also a fact that they lag in international rankings . 
There is a need to provide greater impetus to the ratings process . 
At the same time , there is a need to arrest declining standards in a vast number of institutions . 
A sense of competition has to be developed amongst our higher level institutions including NITs . 
I am glad to learn that a national rankings system is being developed . This will propel our institutions to do better . 
Physical infrastructure is the lever of higher education and faculty is itsfulcrum . 
A lot needs to be done to have quality faculty render world - class teaching to prepare students for a highly competitive and globalized world . 
Vacant faculty positions have to be filled up with talented scholars . 
Refresher courses , participation in international seminars and workshops , and publishing of papers in peer - reviewed journals have to be accorded priority . 
Many NITs have forged MOUs with foreign universities for faculty and student exchanges . 
They have to see to it that these institutional linkages confer the greatest possible benefit on our academic community . 
Research and innovation in NITs have to be given precedence in academic development . 
Some of the steps , I feel , that require renewed focus are inter - disciplinary approach in course curricula and research , identifying the areas of core competency and nurturing centres of excellence , strengthening under - graduate research , and making research an integral part of the teaching - learning process . 
MOUs for research collaboration executed with foreign institutions have to be tracked regularly to ensure their efficacy . 
A suggestion was made in the NIT Directors’ Conference that an MOU for exchange of students and faculty , materials and publications , and joint education and research activities could be negotiated and signed on behalf of all NITs in the North - East with a consortium of institutions in Singapore . 
Such cooperation will provide fillip to our ‘Look East’ Policy as well . 
Turning NITs into world - class engineering institutes call for developing multiple linkages . 
NITs have to actively engage with other institutes for research collaboration and sharing of best practices . 
They have to be more proactive in their interaction with the industry . 
Most NITs have an industry interface cell in place . 
The cell has to explore possibilities like sponsoring of chair positions by industry ; drafting experts from industry in project guidance and curriculum design ; and setting up incubation centres , laboratories and research parks . 
The ‘Make in India’ initiative aimed at making our country a manufacturing hub depends to a large extent on the deepening of this academia - industry alliance . 
NITs have to also devise mechanisms to connect with their alumni , many of whom have excelled in their chosen field . 
They could be inducted in governance mechanisms , or utilized for business and project mentoring of students and in curriculum design . 
I hope the alumni of this Institute , with the first batch to graduate today , will retain their link and communicate frequently . 
Before concluding , I would like to emphasize that our educational institutions , particularly technical schools , should develop in their students a scientific temper . 
Dr . Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan had said and I quote : 
The scientific temperament is characterized by a passion for facts , careful observation and cautious statement of conclusions . 
It discourages reliance on vague impressions , second hand evidence and hasty generalization . 
It calls for a passionless and understanding contemplation of objective nature
Our institutions have to fire the power of imagination of their students . 
They have to prompt them to think beyond what is written in books ; encourage them to accept a proposition only after thorough investigation ; and persuade them to develop a grand vision which they can , through research and inquiry , translate into reality . 
I once again complement this Institute for their endeavour so far and wish them good luck for the future . 
I also wish the graduating students a bright career and fulfilling life ahead . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESIDENT’S STANDARD PRESENTATION TO 115 HELICOPTER UNIT AND 26 SQUADRON
It gives me immense pleasure to be here today at Air Force Station Tezpur , one of the premier Air Bases of the Indian Air Force in the Eastern Sector , to award Standards to 115 Helicopter Unit and 26 Squadron . 
These distinguished flying Units have a glorious past and a rich tradition of professional excellence . 
Since their inception , they have rendered illustrious service to the Nation and done us proud . 
Their rich heritage and stellar efforts in the pursuit of excellence have set a benchmark for others to emulate . 
For their selfless devotion , professionalism and courage in the face of adversity , the Nation honours them today with a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation . 
Indian Air Force has always been at the forefront in the projection of our Nation’s might . 
Besides its role of safeguarding the sovereignty of our Nation , it has always been a harbinger of humanitarian aid within our boundaries . 
The relief operations rendered in the disaster hit regions , often in the face of adverse weather and tragedy , bears testimony to the fortitude , professionalism and determination of the men and women in blue . 
From Kanyakumari to the mighty Himalayas , the resilience and tenacity of the Air Warriors has been a source of tremendous pride for the Nation . 
The professional excellence , grit and determination exhibited by them over the past few decades is highly laudable . 
Their excellent performance has been acknowledged both in India and abroad , during their participation in various International Exercises . 
Today our Nation is on the path of growth in all fields . 
While the Nation grows and develops in all realms , the subcontinent also faces varied threats especially from non - state actors . 
To preserve peace and harmony and promote all round development , it is imperative for us to have an effective deterrence and a strong defense . 
Though as a Nation we are firmly committed to peace , we must be prepared to use our might to safeguard the sovereignty of our Nation , should the need ever arise . 
We are a Nation which believes in equality in all realms . 
The men and women who stand before us today epitomize our grit and determination towards this underlying cause . 
I am immensely proud of our Armed Forces for leading the path in this respect . 
I also take this opportunity to congratulate all the Air Warriors on parade for their exemplary standard of drill , dress and deportment this morning . 
115 Helicopter Unit has had a glorious operational record . 
It was formed in Chandigarh in April 1967 with Mi - 4 Helicopters . 
This was also one of the first Helicopter Units to be equipped with Jet Engine Chetak Helicopters . 
During the 1971 Indo - Pak War , the Unit undertook various operations in support of the Army offensive , casualty evacuation and search and rescue operations . 
The personnel of the Unit have been decorated with several gallantry awards for their courage and valour . 
Since inception , the Unit has not only undertaken and executed various operational missions but has also actively carried out various rescue missions . 
The Unit has forever rendered selfless support during natural calamities . 
In the month of Aug 1975 , the Unit was involved in flood relief operations in Bihar and it was during these challenging operations that the National media aptly christened the Unit as " THE HOVERING ANGELS” , a name that the Unit bears proudly till date . 
Over the years , the Unit has lived up to it’s adage of " Saving Lives… . Always” . 
Hence the motto " AAPATSU MITRAM”meaning " A friend to all those in dire need” manifestly reflects the Unit’s noble and gallant involvement towards the conduct of operations in the region . 
The Unit has operated Mi - 4 , Chetak and Cheetah Helicopters with distinction and accomplishment . 
I am confident that the " Hovering Angels” will continue to grow from strength to strength in the years to come . 
26 Squadron was formed in Adampur in January 1968 and was the first Squadron to be equipped with the indomitable Sukhoi - 7 aircraft . 
The Squadron actively participated in the 1971 Indo - Pak War where it acted as a force multiplier in support of the army offensive . 
The commendable performances of the personnel has been recognised and appreciated in the form of Gallantry Awards . 
In 1977 , the Squadron was re - equipped with MIG 21BIS aircraft and moved to Pathankot . 
Since its inception , the Squadron has undertaken significant operational missions , including several missions flown during the Kargil conflict of 1999 and towards guarding the Northern Skies during the long period of activation as a part of Op Parakram . 
The Squadron has always lived up to its motto of " Yudhyaswa Vigatjwarah” , which when translated reads " Wage War with all your might” . 
I am sure that the Squadron will continue to excel even more , in the times to come . 
In acknowledgement and recognition of their outstanding performances , I award Standards to 115 Helicopter Unit and 26 Squadron . 
On this occasion , I take the opportunity to compliment the personnel and families of 115 Helicopter Unit and 26 Squadron , both past and present , for their selfless service and dedication towards the Nation . 
The Nation is indeed proud of you . 
I wish you all the very best for a glorious future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE INDIAN RED CROSS SOCIETY AND ST . JOHN AMBULANCE ( INDIA ) 
I am indeed very happy to be present amidst you at the Annual General Meeting of the Indian Red Cross Society and St . John Ambulance ( India ) . 
At the very outset , I would like to extend my warm felicitations to the Indian Red Cross Society and the St . John Ambulance ( India ) . 
I congratulate them for their selfless service and their humanitarian work in all parts of Indian society . 
The Indian Red Cross Society and the St . John Ambulance ( India ) are considered the pioneers and role models for voluntary workers and non - governmental organisations in India today . 
I would also like to extend my felicitations to the individuals and institutions who are being recognised today for their outstanding efforts to serve the needy , the ill , the helpless , the aged and all others on whom they have bestowed their kindness and care . 
As we know , the Indian Red Cross Society is the largest statutory humanitarian organisation established in India by an Act of Parliament in 1920 . 
Along with the St . John Ambulance , it has been carrying out a variety of charitable services with great dedication , through its 700 branches . 
It has the invaluable support of thousands of volunteers and members who implement their programmes and initiatives in the different parts of the country . 
I understand that the St . John Ambulance ( India ) centres are spread across 21 States and 3 Union Territories . 
The Indian Red Cross is linked to the 150 year old International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies along with 188 other member countries . 
In recent months , the people of India people have been collectively traumatised by four major natural calamities that have severely affected the populations in Uttarakhand , Odisha , Jammu and Kashmir , and Andhra Pradesh . 
These disasters have destroyed lives and livelihoods as swiftly as they have hit infrastructure and local economies in these places . 
The Indian army , as well as the civilian authorities , have , to their credit , risen to the occasion each time and set new standards through their heroic operations to save and rehabilitate the affected people . 
The Indian Red Cross Society , too , have helped by dispatching aid worth over5 crore rupees to Jammu and Kashmir , and mobilising scores of trained volunteers to assist with evacuations , relief and shelter for the affected communities . 
I take this opportunity to thank the Indian Red Cross Society , its staff and its volunteers , for their whole hearted and effective interventions . 
In most advanced societies , Governments as well as non - governmental organisations have taken the necessary steps to prepare , to the extent possible , for the kind of unforeseeable eventualities that we call disasters . 
In recent years , India , too , has learned from its experiences and taken similar measures . 
Thus , while the 1999 super - cyclone caused 10 , 000 deaths in Odisha , thanks to the pre - emptive arrangements made by Government , the negative impact of the last two cyclones in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh , resulted in very few casualties . 
We could manage to provide safety and security to maximum number of livestock , people and property located in the path of the approaching storms . 
Our success in doing this demonstrates the significant improvement in our technology , capacity and capability to pre - empt and thus mitigate the devastating effect of natural disasters on our territory . 
India’s achievement has been recognized internationally as a triumph of early warning and timely action . 
However , we are aware that more needs to be done : more vulnerable people need to be empowered ; they need to have a greater ability to secure and protect themselves . 
More communities need to be free from the risks of disease and the dangerous forces of nature . 
To achieve that , joint efforts of state institutions and civil society will be required . 
With additional volunteers and skill development – as well as stock - piling of essential relief materials and disaster risk reduction work Government , voluntary service societies and local communities can assist vulnerable populations with ever greater swiftness and efficiency . 
It is indeed a good initiative of the Red Cross that they are building up their human resources for disaster management and humanitarian assistance . 
The flagship project of the Indian Red Cross’ for " First Medical Responders” aimed at training community volunteers is a good step in the correct direction . 
I am glad to see that the Indian Red Cross is also involving young people , the future leaders , in their programmes and engaging with students and educational institutions in a sustained and systematic way . 
In the field of health - care , the Indian Red Cross Society and the St John Ambulance have beenspreading awareness about various aspects of health and sanitation among various target groups and sections of our population . 
Their programmes to facilitate inoculations , vaccinations and preventive treatment etc are well known . 
. I was happy to hear that the Red Cross National Headquarters is even promoting Ayurveda and Yoga for the prevention of non - communicable diseases . 
Through its 166 blood - banks , the Red Cross has , over the decades become synonymous with blood donation . 
I would like to take this opportunity to invite young men and women to come forward and take part in voluntary blood donation to the Red Cross , and thus help save many lives . 
I note that the Indian Red Cross Society , in cooperation with the Belgian Red Cross , have launched Indian guidelines for evidence - based first aid . 
The reference document that they have brought out is adapted to Indian needs and acknowledges traditional healing methods . 
This is a landmark initiative as it will serve as a basis for developing community - based first aid programmes . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , Gandhiji had believed , that " The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others . ”
I call upon all those present here today to reflect on these words . 
Let each one of us seriously consider making a contribution – big or small , to support and supplement the noble efforts of the Government and organizations such as the Red Cross and St John Ambulance in the service of our people . 
With these words , I once again compliment H’ble Health Minister , Shri J . P . Nadda , Dr . S . P . Agarwal and all the office bearers of the Indian Red Cross Society and St . John Ambulance ( India ) . 
I wish you a success in your Annual General Meeting and all your future endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE ANNUAL CONVOCATION OF JAMIA MILLIA ISLAMIA
It is a happy occasion for me to be here today for the Annual Convocation of Jamia Millia Islamia , one of the premier centres of higher learning in the country . 
To start with , let me thank the University for inviting me to be a part of this venerable occasion . 
This historic institution was founded in 1920 by luminaries like Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar , Maulana Mahmood Hasan , Hakim Ajmal Khan , A . M . Khawaja , Dr . Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari and Dr . Zakir Husain . 
In 1925 , its campus was shifted from Aligarh to Delhi . 
In 1962 , Jamia was granted ‘deemed university’ status and in 1988 , it became a Central University . 
Since its inception , Jamia has fostered understanding of India’s rich history and culture , including the cultural traditions of Islam . 
Through its academic programmes , it has instilled in students a national perspective . 
Jamia has a wide academic profile . 
It caters to learning in a variety of disciplines at various levels from under - graduate to PhD . 
It is heartening to know that there are over thirty centres dedicated to research in areas like peace and conflict resolution , women’s studies , media and governance , north - east studies , dalit and minority studies , and comparative religions and civilization . 
Jamia has been a proponent of gender and social equality . 
To support the academic ambitions of the disadvantaged , it runs special courses like Communicative English and self - enrichment programme . 
Jamia has also been a practitioner of Gandhiji’s principle of nai talim , an educational curriculum which does not distinguish between education and work . 
I am happy to learn that Jamia provides vocational training as part of its teaching model . 
I congratulate all of you on coming out with flying colours . 
Having toiled hard to earn your degree , you have a justifiable sense of pride and satisfaction . 
This is your moment of glory . 
At the same time , it is also an occasion to ponder over your priorities in life . 
Whatever field you choose to work in , make your contribution to the society . 
Being the bright young minds of our nation , help mitigate the problems afflicting us . 
As we grapple with issues like drinking water , sanitation , infrastructure , health , crime and gender bias , your perceptive insights coupled with initiative can help overcome them . 
You will find your education useful only if you make yourself useful to the society . Never be petrified by failure . Mahatma Gandhi had said and I quote : 
" The season of failure is the best time for sowing the seeds of success” . 
The road ahead is not easy to travel . But armed with knowledge and exposure that your alma mater has provided , you will sail through rough waters . 
This is my firm belief . 
Mankind has always been instinctive towards progress . 
And , it is education that is one of the differentiating factors . 
Education enriches human lives , advances human thinking , propagates new thought and enhances human capacity . 
Education is a potent vehicle for social emancipation and economic rejuvenation . 
Economic growth in the future will depend more on efficient use of resources and deployment of better technology and processes . 
Knowledge and education will propel economies even more in the years to come . 
It is therefore pertinent that our education sector , particularly higher education , is able to meet this challenge . 
We have made rapid strides in boosting our higher educational infrastructure . 
There are 723 universities and over 37 , 000 colleges in our country . 
Yet , many of our institutes lack quality that denies students world - class education
Many bright students leave the shores to pursue studies abroad . 
We cannot lose our talent , and for that , we have to up - grade our educational standards . 
There is not a single Indian institution amongst the top 200 universities in the world according to reputed surveys . 
I do believe that some of our institutions are better than what the rankings project . 
Our leading institutions have to approach the ratings process in a more systematic and proactive manner . 
However , it is also a fact that an all - out effort to revamp our academic system is the need of the hour . 
Some of the immediate steps would be to ramp up physical infrastructure including classrooms , fill up vacant faculty positions , attract talent from abroad , review and change curriculum to make it inter - disciplinary and industry - oriented , and promote centres of excellence after identifying core competencies . 
Technology has to be harnessed to overcome handicaps like faculty shortage and lack of competency in domain areas . 
The National Knowledge Network and the National Mission on Education in ICT are key technology initiatives in the education sector . 
They have opened a window of opportunity in sharing of course material , lectures and best practices . 
They can bridge distances , forge tie - ups amongst experts scattered by geography , and also make education less costly and more convenient . 
Our institutions have to build expertise to use these technology solutions in a more effective manner . 
Research is the key to the expansion of knowledge frontiers . 
Our country has capability in several areas like space technology and ICT . 
The successful Mars Orbiter Mission is a testimony to our growing scientific prowess . 
Nevertheless , there is a general neglect on research . 
Especially , the focus on research activity is lacking in our universities . 
Unless our institutions become hotbeds of research activity , we as a society will fail to realize the potential that we otherwise are destined to achieve . 
We have to make teaching and research an attractive career opportunity . 
We have to promote research amongst under - graduate students by adopting an inquiry - based approach to subjects and project work . 
We have to attract meritorious students for doing PhD . 
Cutting edge research calls for multi - disciplinary approach and pooling of expertise . 
We have to be proactive in seeking research cooperation with universities abroad . 
A number of MOUs have been signed by Indian universities with their counterparts in various countries . 
It is gladdening to note that Jamia has signed MOUs with institutions in France , Germany , UK , Finland , Canada , Japan and Australia . 
A concerted effort is now required to implement these agreements in letter and spirit . 
Technology development and innovative ideas can transform the lives of the common man , society and the nation . 
There are novel ideas that could be tapped for greater common benefit . 
Out higher academic institutions have to provide a platform where grassroots innovation can be mentored and moulded . 
Creative thinking and a spirit of inquisitiveness have to be promoted in our learning institutions . 
Scientific temper and analytical rigour have to be cultivated , and plurality in academic approach and autonomy of mind encouraged . 
Universities , being an integral part of the society , have to assume greater responsibility for overall development and mitigation of problems concerning our society at large . 
The Government has taken important initiatives recently , aimed at financial inclusion , creation of model villages , Clean India and digital infrastructure . 
Universities have to be active participants in these programmes and undertake outreach activities for their successful implementation . 
More importantly , universities have to produce socially - conscious individuals who are imbued with core values like patriotism , compassion , tolerance , honesty , discipline and respect for women . 
I am confident that the students who have earned their degrees today will take part in nation - building in a meaningful way . 
With these words , I conclude . 
I also wish the management and faculty of this University the very best . 
I once again compliment all the graduating students . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE VRINDAVAN CHANDRODAYA MANDIR
I am delighted to be amongst you in Vrindavan today . 
I congratulate ISKCON for conceiving a unique project of this kind . 
I understand that the Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir , the foundation stone for which was laid on 16thof March this year , shall be an architectural marvel seeking to recreate the glory and the times of Lord Shri Krishna . 
It shall enable thousands of pilgrims who congregate at Vrindavan every year the opportunity of experiencing new levels of spiritual consciousness . 
I also take this opportunity to convey my deep appreciation and respect for His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada , the founder Acharya of ISKCON , who spread the message of Krishna consciousness all over the world . 
A celebrated spiritualist and author , his influence continues to resonate in the hearts of Krishna devotees all over the world even today . 
It was the great saint and philosopher , Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu , who , alongwith his disciples , established temples in Vrindavan and led the cultural renaissance in the fifteenth century . 
He was instrumental in making Vrindavan the seat of bhakti and in disseminating its principles , as enunciated in our ancient texts , throughout India . 
I am happy that the proposed temple seeks to continue and build on this glorious tradition . 
Shri Madhu Pandit Dasa , who has conceived this temple project , has aptly stated that this temple will not be just a mere edifice of concrete and steel , but a living and dynamic institution , and a center of learning and education . 
The Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir will strive to disseminate the philosophical message of the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam in an easy to understand and rational manner –that message is particularly relevant for us as a society today . 
While we as a nation move up the developmental ladder , it is essential that our spiritual core , which forms the bedrock of our civilization , remains undiluted and strong as ever . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , India is one of the oldest and culturally rich civilizations in the world . 
As we now make the transformative change from being a developing to a developed economy , there will be immense pressures on our socio - economic and moral fabric . 
It is , therefore , imperative that we reconnect to our spiritual dimensions . 
There can be no better way of doing this than spreading the Bhagvad Gita’s message of universal love and humanity . 
I congratulate ISKCON for their efforts in highlighting and propagating the timeless teachings of Lord Krishna across the world . 
I am particularly happy to learn about the various initiatives that are being contemplated for the upliftment of society under the aegis of this Project , including welfare programmes for the widows of Vrindavan and the restoration , upgradation and rejuvenation of the important sites of Braj . 
The Akshaya Patra program through which ISKCON is providing mid - day meals to nearly 1 . 4 lakh children in 2160 schools in Mathura District for the last decade is a noble initiative indeed . 
Srimad Bhagavatam describes the four pillars of spirituality – truthfulness , compassion , austerity and purity . 
Civilized societies exist and operate within the framework of these values . 
Lord Krishna , through His timeless teachings in the Bhagavad Gita , has shaped the intellectual , cultural and spiritual mindscape of India for several millennia . 
It is , thus , only appropriate that Vrindavan strives to become a world renowned center for spiritual enlightenment , from where the message of divinity and peace resonates across all humanity . 
I am glad to know that Government of India and the Government of Uttar Pradesh have taken various initiatives towards making Vrindavan a hub of religious tourism . 
The present project adds a new dimension to these initiatives and shall hopefully generate positive spin - offs both for local society and the economy . 
I am confident that ISKCON will continue to partner both the Central and the State Governments in their efforts aimed at social change and reformation . 
I once again wish the Project and the entire ISCKON team all success in their endeavors . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE JAWAHARLAL NEHRU MEMORIAL LECTURE ON JAWAHARLAL NEHRU AND THE MAKING OF MODERN INDIA
I am honoured to deliver the 46thJawaharlal Nehru Memorial Lecture being organized on the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru . 
I am grateful to Mrs . Sonia Gandhi , Chairperson and the Trustees of the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund for this invitation . 
It is not easy to do justice to Jawaharlal Nehru ' s remarkable life as well as his contribution to the making of a modern India in a short lecture . 
I shall however strive today to briefly cover some of his views , his actions and the legacy he left behind . 
In May of this year , India saw a peaceful transfer of power from one political formation to another for the eighth time since 1952 . 
On September 24 , 2014 , the Mars Mission launched by the Indian Space Research Organization entered the orbit of the red planet . 
In 2008 , India and United States concluded a Civil Nuclear Agreement which recognized India as a State with advanced nuclear technologies and brought India into the international nuclear mainstream . 
What I have cited above are three important but different moments in India’s recent history . 
But , a common thread which runs through them and what they dramatically illustrate is how Nehru’s legacy is not just intact , but continues to lead modern day India to new heights of achievement . 
Nehru’s services to India are immeasurable . 
He was one of the greatest figures of our times . 
Nehru had a clear vision of what modern India should look like and he set out to realize his dreams by establishing strong pillars which would support the young nation . 
If India is a vibrant democracy today , it is because of the foundations laid by Nehru . 
If India has become the third largest economy in the world in terms of Purchasing Power Parity , it is because of the multi - purpose projects , the public sector undertakings and institutions of higher learning established by Nehru as well as the systematic planning process initiated by him . 
If India is today counted amongst the technologically advanced nations of the world , it is because of Nehru’s promotion of scientific temper and the chain of scientific research laboratories that he built across the country . 
It is Nehru who brought us from a backward and dependent economy to the emerging power we are today . 
It is he who has equipped Indians with the confidence and ability to ensure that our country obtains its rightful and honoured place amongst the leading nations of the world . 
Nehru and the Freedom Movement
Jawaharlal Nehru’s contribution to the freedom movement was unique . 
The end of the First World War saw the unravelling of major empires ruled by the Kaiser , the Caliph and the Tsar . 
In India , 1917 saw the Home Rule Movement commence under the leadership of Dr . Annie Besant . Jawaharlal Nehru , still in his twenties , began his political career as one of the Joint Secretaries of the Home Rule League in Uttar Pradesh with his father Motilal Nehru as President . 
Jawaharlal Nehru then plunged into the Non - Cooperation movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi and went to jail in December , 1921 . 
Thereafter , Nehru continued to be in the front ranks of the freedom movement . 
He became the Congress President at the age of 40 in the Lahore Congress of 1929 . 
The transfer of baton from the father , Motilal Nehru who presided over the Congress Session at Calcutta in 1928 was not just symbolic . 
It truly meant a transfer of leadership of the Congress to the younger generation . 
The Lahore Congress declared " Purna Swaraj” as its goal and authorised the launch of the Civil Disobedience Movement . 
Nehru then went on to become President of the Congress in the Lucknow Session of 1936 , Faizpur Session in 1937 and many more times . 
Long before freedom from foreign rule became a reality , Jawaharlal Nehru as President of the Indian National Congress declared in 1936 that India’s ultimate objective was the establishment of " a democratic state , ” " full democracy” and a " new social and economic order” . 
Nehru also popularized the demand for a Constituent Assembly to draft India’s Constitution and made it a central issue in the 1937 provincial elections . 
Nehru logged a total of 3262 days in jail during the freedom struggle with 1040 days during the 1942 Quit India Movement as the longest spell . 
It is during this period that Nehru penned the 1200 page manuscript ofThe Discovery of India while under arrest in Ahmednagar Fort . 
It was written in flowing hand using rationed war time paper with no cut , blemish or correction . 
Nehru was prodigiously productive in terms of writing and thinking during his different periods in jail . 
As is well known , Glimpses of World Historywas written by him in 1934 , based on 196 letters written to his young daughter , Indira from various prisons . 
He covered in these letters the entire history of humankind from 6000 B . C . to the time of writing these letters using only his personal notes and without any reference books . 
Nehru’s intense passion for India’s freedom can be seen from his words of April 1942 , " We want much” , " Our appetite for freedom is insatiable . We are hungry for it , and our throats are parched with thirst . 
Nehru and Parliamentary Democracy
The establishment of full Parliamentary Democracy in India was a momentous step in the history of de - colonization . 
Nehru played a central role in shaping the process by which limited representative government given by the British in progressive doses was transformed into vibrant and powerful institutions that suited the genius of the Indian people . 
Democracy , for Nehru , meant a responsible and responsive political system governing through consultation and discussion . 
There was in him what his biographer S . Gopal calls : " a granite core of intellectual and moral commitment to democratic values”
Moving the ‘Objectives’ Resolution in the Constituent Assembly , Nehru observed " Whatever system of Government we may establish here must fit in with the temper of our people and be acceptable to them”
Nehru established healthy practices and precedents as Leader of the House in the Provisional Parliament of 1950 and in the First , Second , and Third Lok Sabhas from 1952 to 1964 . 
He treated Parliament with great respect and sat patiently through long and often tedious debates as an example to his colleagues and young parliamentarians . 
He spoke frequently in Parliament , and used it as a forum to disseminate his views to the public . 
Letters from Members of Parliament were invariably replied to personally and promptly . Nehru laid down conventions of lasting value by upholding the Speaker’s position in the House . 
Nehru promoted frank discussions on subjects of importance in the Houses of Parliament and did not appreciate the use of public interest as a reason to deny information . 
Nehru was aware that the lack of an established Opposition meant significant weakness in the system . He said : 
" I do not want India to be a country in which millions of people say " yes” to one man , I want a strong opposition . ”
Most of the time of Parliament Sessions during the first to the third Lok Sabhas were devoted to discussing legislation , budget , Plan and matters related to money and finance . 
The volume of financial transactions in those days was very meagre . 
In fact , Jawaharlal Nehru once jokingly commented that the budget of the Government of India is less than the budget of the New York Municipal Corporation . 
But , this did not prevent Members of Parliament from having full debate on various financial issues , especially the Five Year Plans . 
Nehru frequently met Opposition leaders to exchange ideas on crucial issues and asked his Ministers to welcome probing questions and debates . 
Even though , there was no formal opposition party , Nehru gave highest respect to Opposition leaders like Dr . Shyama Prasad Mukherjee , Shri Hiren Mukherjee , Shri H . V . Kamath , Shri A . K . Gopalan and Shri Ashok Mehta , all of whom were members of the first Lok Sabha . 
Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee who was elected to the second Lok Sabha and Dr . Ram Manohar Lohia who became member of the third Lok Sabha also received special attention from Nehru . 
Nehru took keen interest in the Question Hour and was almost always present during the Hour . 
Nehru was attentive to the need to preserve and protect the rights and privileges of members . 
He was also particular that the dignity and prestige of the House should be maintained at all times . 
Nehru had tremendous faith in the capacity of poor , unlettered people to understand issues and exercise reasoned choices . 
He did not use the excuse of the partition of the country and the consequent communal violence or influx of refugees to postpone elections . 
On the contrary , he was impatient to go to the people and unhappy that elections could not be held earlier . 
In the campaign for the first General Elections of 1951 - 52 , Nehru personally travelled some 25 , 000 miles and addressed around 35 million people or a tenth of India’s then population . 
He educated the people about the value of adult suffrage and their duty to discharge their right to vote with responsibility . 
Nehru and Secularism
Nehru was secular to the core . When the French writer André Malraux asked Nehru late in life what had been his most difficult task , he replied , " creating a just state by just means , I think . . . . ” And , after a brief pause : " Perhaps creating a secular state in a religious country , especially when its religion is not founded on an inspired book . ”
It was because of Nehru’s consistent efforts that India established itself as a secular state with equal rights for all regardless of their religious affiliation . 
Nehru and Empowerment of Women
Nehru was keen that women play their part as equal citizens in the nation . 
Unlike in the West , women in India got the right to vote at the same time as men , a goal spelt out by the Congress as early as 1928 . He said in a speech at Kalyani in 1954 that : 
Women of India must play an adequate role in the building of the country . 
Without them the country cannot make rapid progress . 
The state of progress of the country can be known by the condition of its women because they are the makers of the people of the country . 
Nehru and Foreign Policy
The aftermath of World War II saw the globe split between two rival power blocs of East and West . 
For India , more so for Nehru , who as Prime Minister , held the portfolio of foreign affairs for seventeen long years , staying out of military blocs and alliances was essential to maintaining freedom of action for the nascent Indian state . 
Nehru refused to accept assistance under the Marshall Plan so as not to compromise India’s independence in foreign policy matters . 
Nehru’s policy of non - alignment did not mean equidistance or isolationism . 
It meant independence of judgment and action . 
t was not a passive but a pro - active and dynamic policy in which India was strongly committed to the goals of the United Nations and would do its best for peace in the world . 
Nehru did not wish to involve India in the conflict which the great powers were waging or become a camp follower of any group . 
As early as in 1946 , India moved a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly condemning racial discrimination in South Africa . India sent troops for peace keeping to the Gaza strip and Congo . 
India was a tireless campaigner against nuclear weapons and testing in the oceans and the atmosphere . 
It played an important role in the conclusion of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 . 
Today , when the Cold War has passed into history books , it should be kept in mind that Nehru’s foreign policy was rooted in the sound , consistent principle of " India first” . 
Nehru and the building of India’s economy
India emerged from colonial rule a mostly agrarian country . 
Agriculture had been virtually stagnant for half a century and the average rate of economic growth was less than one percent . 
Against this dismal backdrop , the first fifteen years saw an estimated GDP growth at 4 % and nearly 2 percent per capita ( as opposed to 0 . 1 percent in the years 1900 - 47 ) . 
This was a historic turning point and India was on par with the best performing economies of its time , ahead of China , UK , Japan . 
Congress President Subash Chandra Bose in 1938 set up a National Planning Committee with Jawaharlal Nehru as its Chairman . Jawaharlal Nehru included in it not just politicians but scientists , economists , businessmen and industrialists . 
Planning was seen by Nehru as a vast national endeavour and not just the task of the Planning Commission . 
The well known economist P . C . Mahalanobis described the Nehruvian approach to planning as the Middle Way or the Middle Path . 
The Mixed Economy and Welfare State emerged thereafter as important concepts . 
The setting up of the Planning Commission , the emergence of the public sector , of land reforms , of regulations on industrial monopoly , of state trading were all the result of Nehru’s multifaceted initiatives . 
Nehru also devised the institution of the National Development Council ( NDC ) to secure national and inter - regional consensus on development programmes . 
The NDC has been described as an example of federalism in action . 
Nehru oriented the country to the socialist path by including the Directive Principles of State Policy in the Constitution . 
It was at the historic Avadi Session of the Indian National Congress in 1955 , that the Congress gave itself , formally , the creed of a socialistic pattern of society . 
The Session coincided with the launch of the Second Five Year Plan . 
From then onwards , vigorous utilization of resources , rapid industrialization and achieving equitable distribution became the nation’s priorities . 
Nehru has been criticised in later years for having accorded primacy to the Government in economic matters . 
These policies must be however seen in the context of Nehru’s times . 
Capital formation in a society , exploited for 190 years was a huge task which could not be left to the private sector alone . 
Planning helped allocate scarce resources in accordance with national priorities . The relative merit of a regulated economy was widely accepted those days . 
Nehru’s efforts did not throttle private initiative . 
The private sector continued to play an important role , especially in agriculture and small and medium industries . 
In fact , during the early days of independence , even the private sector supported the idea of a key role for government in creating economic growth . 
Moreover , many private sector companies received strong support from public sector financial institutions , enabling them turn into domestic giants in their respective fields . 
Nehru’s speech at the inauguration of the Bhakra Nangal Dam still remains in memory as one of his finest ever : 
For me , the temples , the gurudwaras , the churches , the mosques of today are these places where human beings labour for the benefit of other human beings , of humanity as a whole . 
They are the temples of today . I feel more , if I may use the word , religious - minded when I see these great works than when I see any temple or any place of pure worship . 
These are the places of worship because here we worship something ; we build up Indians ; we build up the millions of India and so this is a sacred task , 
Investment in steel and fertilisers , hydro - electric dams and aluminium smelters had an all round effect on the economy . 
Growth rates in agriculture during 1950 - 65 averaged 2 . 6 percent , higher than in the entire first half of the 20thcentury in India . 
Gopal has summarised Nehru’s achievements as follows : 
" He consolidated a nation , trained it for democracy , constructed a model for economic development and set the country on the path to growth . ”
Nehru and Science
Nehru believed that caste prejudices , religious bigotry , social inequalities etc . could be eliminated only by developing a scientific spirit in our social relations and mental habits . 
Along with scientific achievement , the development of a scientific frame of mind and a scientific habit of thinking was equally important . 
Science was not only a search for truth , but also meant for the betterment of man . 
A Science Policy was adopted by the Government and scientific laboratories set up across the country . 
Indian Institutes of Technology were established to nurture manpower in engineering . 
Frontier disciplines such as space and atomic energy came under the personal supervision of the Prime Minster . 
Today we tend to take for granted the success of our Parliamentary Democracy . 
It must be however kept in mind that in many newly independent nations , first generation nationalist leaders concentrated all power in their own hands and were succeeded by military rulers . 
It was Jawaharlal Nehru and other founding fathers who ensured that on gaining independence , power was transferred to the people of India through adoption of the Constitution and regular free and fair elections . 
At the time of independence , it was widely believed that India would soon lapse into authoritarianism and the democratic experiment will collapse . 
India consolidated itself in the difficult formative years of its nation - building because of the strong and stable system of parliamentary democracy established by Nehru . 
The challenge that India faced and the importance of her success has been well described by former Prime Minister of Britain , Sir Anthony Eden : 
Of all the experiments in government , which have been attempted since the beginning of time , I believe that the Indian venture into parliamentary government is the most exciting . 
A vast sub - continent is attempting to apply to its tens and thousands of millions a system of free democracy . 
It is a brave thing to try to do so . 
The Indian venture is not a pale imitation of our practice at home , but a magnified and multiplied reproduction on a scale we have never dreamt of . 
If it succeeds , its influence on Asia is incalculable for good . Whatever the outcome , we must honour those who attempt it . 
Nehru when once asked what his legacy to India would be , replied : 
" Hopefully , it is four hundred million people capable of governing themselves”
In the words of S Gopal , " Achieved against daunting odds , democracy in India - Adult suffrage , a sovereign Parliament , a free press , an independent judiciary - is Nehru’s most lasting monument . ” [ 
Jawaharlal Nehru’s life and vision , his struggles and his achievements were no less than epic . 
But it is his deep democratic spirit and practice of a politics vested in the sovereignty of the people that is his most precious legacy to us . 
The manner in which 66 . 4 % of our 834 million strong electorate exercised their vote in the recent elections to the 16th Lok Sabha is the best validation of Nehru’s efforts in the above regard . 
Democracy has struck deep roots in India and survived against enormous odds thanks to Nehru’s stewardship of the nation in its early years . 
Every one of our institutions from the independent judiciary and free press to the legislatures and the Election Commission bear the hallmark of Nehru . 
Looking ahead , we must renew afresh the imperative of protecting and strengthening our democratic institutions and practices . 
Imperfect they may be , but they represent the best way forward for our nation as we forge ahead into the 21stcentury . 
I conclude this memorial lecture saluting and paying my humble respects to Jawahar , the Jewel of India . India is what it is today because of Nehru , his vision and his lifetime of dedication to the nation . 
Let us celebrate his legacy and draw inspiration from his life to take our nation towards greater and greater glory . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE CALL ON BY MEMBERS OF THE 54TH NDC COURSE AND STAFF OF NATIONAL DEFENCE COLLEGE
At the outset , I would like to express my deep gratitude to the National Defence College for giving me the opportunity to share some of my perceptions with participants attending the 54th NDC Course at the National Defence College which includes officers from the Civil Services , Armed Forces , and officers from friendly foreign countries . 
I welcome all of you to the historic Durbar Hall of Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
I need to hardly emphasize that the success of any nation depends on how effectively it can harness resources available at its disposal , foremost among which is human resource . 
The National Defence College of India , where senior officers from not only armed forces but also from civil services and friendly foreign countries are imparted domain knowledge , perform the task of development of human resources effectively . 
Their skills are honed to elevate them to effectively deal with national security issues . 
In a democratic system like ours , various organs of the state must complement each other in the goal espoused by the Political leadership . 
Senior civil service officers must be conversant with the capabilities , challenges and issues concerning the national security . 
Similarly , the officers of the armed forces must get a perspective of the constitutional frame - work under which the political executive and the civil services function . 
In this context , there should be synergy and coordination amongst them all to take informed decisions regarding national security . 
The global environment today poses numerous challenges because of its dynamic nature . 
Every country is guided in its actions by its national interests and objectives . 
Power relationships are constantly changing , and unless a nation fully understands and adjusts itself to the changes that are taking place , its own security could be in jeopardy . 
We , as a nation , are constantly pursuing the development of friendly relations with countries in all spheres . 
Security is an important aspect of international cooperation . 
It , therefore , transcends the traditional view that the armed forces of a nation are only concerned with the territorial integrity of a nation and where conflict is involved . 
Its role today encompasses economic , energy , food , health , environment amongst many others . 
The prestige and power of a nation is also significantly influenced by its military capabilities that have to be effective in countering security challenges . 
Today , we as a nation are faced with several challenges . 
They include the scourge of international terrorism . 
The problem has been compounded by non - state actors who are often sponsored , financed and armed by states . 
Not only our armed forces , but those of other peace loving nations too should brace themselves to meet this challenge . 
In order to counter the complex security threats , our defence forces should be equipped with modern and sophisticated weapons . 
Unfortunately , our forces are heavily dependant on imported wares . 
Today the dependency is around 70 percent in regard to our capital requirement . 
But this high level of dependency is fraught with danger for our armed forces . 
The technology denial regimes , and the availability of critical spares and support at crucial moments can pose serious challenges to our security forces . 
This level of dependency has to reduce substantially . 
A well calibrated strategy with primary focus on the development of indigenous military industrial complex should be implemented sooner than later . 
In such instances , the Cabinet Committee on Security would take decision on a case - to - case basis . 
We have recently enhanced the FDI ceiling in defence from 26 to 49 per cent . 
This ceiling would not be an impediment where state - of - the - art technology is involved . 
This measure is expected to strengthen the indigenous defence industry . 
National security demands a multi - dimensional , and a systematic and holistic approach . 
It calls for intense research across a wide spectrum of subjects . 
At the same time , the various subjects should not be studied in isolation . 
The emphasis should be on analysis maintaining cross linkages . 
Kautilya , in his famous treatise on statecraft , Arthashastra has given importance to multi - disciplinary approach . 
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , while inaugurating the National Defence College in 1960 had articulated his thoughts and I quote : 
Defence is not an isolated subject . 
It is intimately connected with the economic , industrial and many other aspects in the country and is all encompassing . 
I have been informed that six streams comprise the curricula of the National Defence College course . 
The Socio - Political Study is intended to help you comprehend the main features of the Indian society and polity and to assess issues which have a bearing on national security . 
The Economy , Science and Technology Studies have been intended to introduce you to the principles and practices that shape economic trends and the influence of science and technology in attaining self - reliance primarily in fields that have a bearing on security
The Studies on International Security Environment , Global Issues and India’s Strategic Neighborhood focuses on the international security environment as also its impact on India’s foreign policy . 
The Study on Strategies and Structures for National Security is a synthesis of all that you have learned and experienced during this course . 
The role of the armed forces has expanded with the revolution in military affairs and globalization . 
It is clear that future conflicts in the complex defence and security ecosystem will require a more integrated multi - state and multi - agency approach . 
Preparing military leaders , police officers and civil servants to deal with the security environment of the future will necessarily have to be addressed in a holistic and comprehensive manner . 
I am confident that this prestigious Course would enable you to take informed and reasoned decisions regarding security issues . 
I congratulate NDC for conducting this course every year with élan . 
I once again wish you all success in your future endeavours and hope that you all will bring laurels to National Defence College and the country that you serve . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF THE PRESENTATION OF THE 49TH JNANPITH AWARD
It is indeed a pleasure for me to present amidst you today on the happy occasion of the presentation of the 49thJnanpith award to the eminent Hindi poet , Dr . Kedarnath Singh , for his outstanding contribution towards Indian literature . 
I congratulate him for winning this coveted award . I am sure he will continue to enrich Hindi literature in the years to come . 
The philanthropist couple , Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain and Late Smt . Rama Jain , were the pioneers of the Bharatiya Jnanpith , initiating and then institutionalizing this noble endeavour of recognizing and awarding Indian authors for their contribution to Indian literature . 
It was indeed a significant and welcome step in shaping our country’s literary map . 
I congratulate Bharatiya Jnanpith and its trustees for working tirelessly towards translating the dreams of its illustrious founders into reality . 
I am delighted to know that for the last seven decades the Bharatiya Jnanpith is encouraging works of original modern literature in Hindi , besides publishing Hindi translations of works of eminent writers of various Indian languages . 
They have published more than a thousand books till date , admired by readers across all strata of society . 
The Bharatiya Jnanpith has creditably brought many regional languages and its authors to the forefront and has awarded them for their contributions to enriching Indian literature . 
It is indeed an act of commendable praise and I congratulate them for working for national integration through literary endeavors . 
India is a country of many languages and we celebrate our linguistic diversity by creating some magnificent works each year which contribute to our literary heritage . 
The endeavor now has to be to spread the beauty , depth and resonance of our literary mosaic to all corners of the world . 
I urge this distinguished gathering to work tirelessly towards this mission . 
The highest number of awardees from all Indian languages come from Hindi and Dr . Kedarnath Singh has , through this recognition , joined the pantheon of outstanding litterateurs like Pant , Dinkar , Ajneya , Mahadevi , Naresh Mehta , Nirmal Verma , Kunwar Narain , Shrilal Shukl and Amarkant . 
Dr . Kedarnath Singh , through his poetry , has offered us a rare assimilation of rhymes and lyrical prose , exploring both the realms of reality and fantasy with equal felicity . 
His poetry presents a collage of meaning , colours and acceptance . 
A poet of unique stature , his approach is not only sensitive to modern aesthetics but also to traditional rural communities while at all times being committed to the celebration called life . 
Dr . Singh is a celebrated teacher as well who has taught at JNU , one of the premier institutions of learning in India . 
I am delighted that a visionary and a poet like him has had the benefit of countless young minds as a canvas . 
I am sure a lot many of his students , having gained from his experience and insights , will contribute in various ways to enriching our national life and heritage . 
It is my fond wish that our younger generation delves deep into Indian classics . 
This will not only help in resetting the moral compass but would also go a long way in contributing to our efforts at nation building . 
I am sure that the Bharatiya Jnanpith will adequately work out ways of exposing our youth to the brilliance of our literature . 
I once again congratulate Dr . Kedarnath Singh on being presented the Jnanpith award and wish him many more years of creative excellence . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON “INDIA - BHUTAN RELATIONS”
It is always a delight to be in Thimphu among old friends . 
Over the last decades , I have had the good fortune of visiting the Druk Yul several times . 
On each occasion , I have felt a familiar sense of anticipation while flying over the Himalayan ranges towards the pristine heights of your magnificent country . 
The snow covered mountain peaks below seem to cheerfully remind me that I am approaching an abode of happiness , where economic progress is ameansand not an end , where there is a premium on contentment - and where development has not cast a shadow on the preservation of the natural heritage of an enlightened people . 
Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen , having served in my humble capacities while serving in the Government of India – including at the helm of our Defence , Finance and Foreign Ministries , I have had the opportunity to develop a unique perspective of the India – Bhutan relationship . 
I would , today , sum it up as an exemplary bilateral relationship between two neighboring countries , a unique and successful partnership for mutual benefit , and a symbiotic friendship between two peoples bound by age - old historical and cultural linkages . 
Despite the differences in our national situations , we are powerfully connected by our many commonalities and complementarities . 
There is a deep confidence and trust between our Governments and peoples and we have ensured that we remain sensitive , as closely co - operating neighbours , to each other ' s concerns and vital interests . 
That we forged our partnership in the decade of the 1950s is a result - and reflection - of the converging vision of the leadership of both our countries . 
The Third King of Bhutan , His Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and the first Prime Minister of India , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had not only recognised the infinite potential of our partnership , but taken many steps to reinforce it . 
The historic journey made by Pandit Nehru to Paro , through challenging terrain to reach here on horseback and the memorable reception that he was accorded by the Monarch and people of Bhutan are remembered even to this day . 
They are a testimony to the commitment and warmth that existed between the founding fathers of India and Their Majesties , the revered former Kings of Bhutan . 
Thereafter , in more recent times , the judiciousness and foresight of the successive Monarchs of Bhutan - including Their Majesties the Fourth and Fifth Kings , has contributed immeasurably towards building a fruitful , collaborative relationship between our two nations for the benefit of our respective peoples . 
I believe that as the inheritors of this legacy , we are duty bound to nurture every aspect of it and ensure that we continue to build on it and realise its full potential . 
In this context , I am happy to state that these last months have been marked by a consolidation and intensification of our close bilateral ties . 
It was an honour to receive His Majesty , Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Her Majesty , Ashi Jetsun Pema Wangchuck in India at the beginning of this year ; Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi chose Bhutan as his first overseas destination - within a month of assuming office and I am here on the first State Visit by a President of India after a gap of more than 26 years . 
We have taken a number of initiatives this year to strengthen our friendship and close co - operation - there is much to be very satisfied about and much to look forward to . 
Our exchanges at the political as well as official level and our frank dialogue on all issues have facilitated our mutual understanding and close collaboration in the inclusive development and socio - economic progress of our peoples . 
We have a common objective of sustainable development , education for all and the development of innovative solutions to address the specific needs of our populations from the grassroots upwards . 
It is India’s belief that it is also in India’s interest to see a strong , vibrant and prosperous Bhutan . 
We are told by our friends in Bhutan that they believe that a strong , united and economically dynamic India is in Bhutan’s national interest as well . 
Thus , we both have proven to the world that our nations find ourselves coexisting in perfect harmony - with our destinies inter - linked in many ways – and yet we remain distinct and independent as we pursue our many analogous developmental priorities . 
Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen , both India and Bhutan are proud democracies . 
Whereas Indians had to fight for their independence , the people of Bhutan were bestowed this precious gift by the reigning monarch himself . 
India chose to be a socialist secular democratic republic . 
Mahatma Gandhi , the apostle of peace and non - violence who led India to freedom from colonial rule , believed in the basic human tenets of freedom , liberty and independence which are at the core of the Indian Constitution . 
In Bhutan , His Majesty , King Jigme Singye Wangchuck , the Fourth King , himself guided the drafting of Bhutan’s Constitution , after a process of consulting Bhutanese citizens across the length and breadth of the country . 
The Constitution of Bhutan , in its final form , has been welcomed and embraced by the people of Bhutan . 
We stand by the people of Bhutan as they move ahead as a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy . 
One of the things that I have learned in my long association with Bhutan is - that there is so muchmore to be learned - from the way of life and philosophy of the people of Bhutan . 
You have chosen a growth paradigm that is not purely based on GDP but on the happiness of your people . 
The profound words of His Majesty , King Jigme Singye Wangchuk left a deep impression on me – when he stated that " Gross National Happiness has come to mean so many things to so many people but to me it signifies simply development guided by human values . ”
Your Excellency ! I could not agree more . In my conversations with students , politicians , professionals , representatives of the corporate world and people from all walks of life in India , since I took this office and gave up active politics , I have been stressing the need for Indians to evoke and rekindle in themselves the civilisational Indian values that have been an intrinsic part of theirdharma andsamskaras . 
It is significant that in Bhutan , the Gross National Happiness principle is the vision as well as the screening tool for Bhutan’s Five Year Plans : its four pillars – ( i ) sustainable development , ( ii ) preservation and promotion of cultural values , ( iii ) conservation of the national environment and ( iv ) establishment of good governance rely on the full and enthusiastic participation of the people for their success . India stands ready to assist in the realization of these important goals . 
From the time of Bhutan’s First Five Year Plan itself , India , herself a developing economy , has offered Bhutan her technical assistance and shared her resources to the best of her capabilities and capacities . 
India has , in the past - and will continue in the future , to offer seats in our premier educational institutions to our Bhutanese friends . 
Accompanying me is Professor Anil Gupta of the Indian Institute of Management , Ahmedabad who will sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Royal Civil Service Commission of Bhutan for , inter alia , advancement of quality of civic administration by training of public servants . 
In his capacity as Executive Vice Chair of the National Innovation Foundation , Professor Anil Gupta will sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Royal University of Bhutanfor enhancing the role of innovation in the education system and economy of Bhutan . 
Professor Sunaina Singh , Vice Chancellor of the English and Foreign Languages University of Hyderabad will also sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Royal University of Bhutan that provides for academic and consultancy services in English language , learning , teaching and training . 
I am pleased to announce that we have decided to enhance the value of the Indian Ambassador’s Scholarship Fund from current Rs . 1 Crore per annum to Rs . 2 Crore per annum . 
This scholarship will be utilized to encourage promising but needy students from Bhutan desiring to pursue higher studies in premier educational institutions in India . 
Hydropower is a classic example of the win - win cooperation between our countries . 
The three existing hydropower projects have helped to electrify almost all of Bhutan , export surplus power to India and earn assured revenues to further fuel growth and expansion . 
With the Punatsangchu projects on track for completion by 2018 and the Mangdechhu Project expected to be completed by the end of 2017 , the future of power production in Bhutan looks promising indeed . 
To build on our success , we have decided to also take up 4 more projects as joint ventures between public sector undertakings of India and Bhutan . 
The foundation stone for the first such project , the Kholongchhu , has , in fact , been laid by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India during his visit to Bhutan in June 2014 . 
Alongside our co - operation in all these areas in Bhutan , the large and growing Indian market holds tremendous possibilities for exports from Bhutan - from agro - processed foods to cement , India can absorb whatever surplus Bhutan chooses to share . 
As we move further into the 21st Century , I am confident that the core values of our relationship will continue to strengthen our bonds further . 
We both agree that our success , so far , indicates the tremendous future potential of our co - operation that we can - and must realise . 
We can also do more in the field of tourism : the commencement of a flight from Paro to Mumbai has , I believe , led to a significant rise in the numbers of tourists from Western India . 
2015 has been designated as " Visit Bhutan Year” . 
In signing a Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Nalanda University , our two Governments will open new opportunities for Bhutanese students to once again visit the famed Nalanda University . 
We have had the pleasure of welcoming the first student from Bhutan at the Nalanda University in September 2014 . 
We would welcome the collaboration and support of Bhutan in rejuvenating and reviving this great ancient University . 
Finally , I would like to suggest that India and Bhutan must take up , with all earnestness , their role within SAARC to move our regional cooperation towards positive and productive programmes for the advancement of the region and global peace , security and development . 
The forthcoming SAARC Summit in Kathmandu will be a crucial meeting in which Bhutan and India can work together to contribute to constructive deliberations and far reaching outcomes . 
With these words , I thank you once again for the opportunity of sharing some of my perceptions with this very distinguished gathering . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF THE SCOPE MERITORIOUS AWARDS
I am indeed happy to be amidst you on this occasion of the presentation of the SCOPE Meritorious Awards for the year 2012 - 13 . 
I would like to compliment the Department of Public Enterprises ( DPE ) and Standing Conference of Public Enterprises ( SCOPE ) for organizing this event which provides recognition to the efforts being made by our CPSEs in a variety of areas such as Environmental Excellence & Sustainable Development ; Corporate Governance ; Corporate Social Responsibility & Responsiveness ; Research and Development and Technology Development & Innovation . 
The Central Public Sector Enterprises were set up immediately after independence to occupy the commanding heights of the economy and to channelize investment in areas which were critical to our efforts at development and self - reliance . 
The total investment in our 277 CPSEs stood at more than Rs . 8 . 5 lakh crores as on 31stMarch , 2013 . Operational CPSEs had a turnover of approximately Rs . 19 . 45 lakh crores , with the aggregate net profit of profit - making CPSEs amounting to Rs . 1 . 43 lakh crores during 2012 - 13 . 
Market capitalization of 46 listed CPSEs stood at more than Rs . 11 . 16 lakh crores as on 31st March , 2013 . 
These figures clearly demonstrate the pivotal role that the CPSEs play in our economy . 
As envisaged at the time of their creation , they have proved to be the backbone of our developmental effort and are rightly recognized as drivers of growth in infrastructure and other critical sectors of the economy . 
The Government has taken a number of steps to improve the functioning of CPSEs . 
These include empowerment of Boards of Maharatna , Navratna and Miniratna CPSEs , professionalization of Boards of CPSEs and strengthening of performance evaluation systems . 
These steps have contributed significantly in creating a positive and conducive policy framework for CPSEs . 
India today stands at the cusp of a transformative phase which , I firmly believe , will successfully place us in the league of developed nations over the next two decades . 
In the last ten years itself , we have scripted a wonderful success story emerging as one of the leading economies of the world and the third largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity . 
From 2004 - 05 to 2013 - 14 , our economy grew at an average rate of 7 . 6 per cent per year . 
Due to the continuing global economic slowdown and other factors , our GDP growth rate was subdued at below five per cent during the last two years . 
I am , however , happy to share that the green shoots of recovery are already visible . 
In the first quarter of the current financial year , the Indian economy achieved a growth rate of 5 . 7 per cent . 
Various steps taken towards fiscal consolidation have shown positive results . Inflation has decelerated over the past three months and we hope to contain it below 5 % through a judicious mix of policy measures . 
India now ranks second in the world in both wheat and rice production . A record food grains production last year helped the agriculture sector to register a growth of 4 . 7 per cent in 2013 - 14 . 
A number of measures aimed at investment revival , strengthening macro - economic stability and ramping up infrastructure will certainly posit India back into the high growth trajectory of 7 - 8 per cent . 
I must , in this context , make special mention to the Prime Minister’s ‘Make in India’ campaign which has recently been launched by Government to transform India into a truly world - class , global manufacturing hub . 
I believe that our CPSEs have a vital role in making this a reality . 
They have , over the years , established excellent manufacturing facilities in various parts of the country . 
We have one of the largest markets in the world and there is no dearth of demand for competitively priced , quality products . 
We should aim not only at catering to our huge domestic demand but also towards high quality product development and greater access to foreign markets . 
This would not only create adequate employment opportunities for our youth but also raise standards of living across . 
This expansion of operations to cater to both domestic and foreign markets can only come after making a realistic assessment of business potential and ensuring that our products conform to international standards . 
For this purpose , latest technology needs to be harnessed , both through suitable industry - academia linkages and by entering into strategic alliances with entities which possess these technologies . 
It is also imperative that attention is focused on vendor development and mandatory procurement through small and medium enterprises . 
This would not only develop local industry but also boost domestic manufacturing and usher in a culture of entrepreneurship in the country . 
I would , in particular , draw your attention on the need to innovate while doing business . 
An ever changing and dynamic business scenario throws up newer and complex challenges which call for innovative solutions . 
Over the years our CPSEs have developed a certain way of doing business . 
In today’s scenario it is critical to re - examine , re - engineer and reinvent processes in order to continuously stay ahead of market requirements and expectations . 
I would , accordingly , advise all of you to critically re - appraise existing systems and procedures and develop newer , more efficient ways of doing business with a view to taking full advantage of the latent potentialities that exist , both on the material and human front , in your organisations . 
The CPSEs have actively partnered Government in implementing its social and economic policies . 
I am confident they will continue to take the lead in the ‘Swachh Bharat’ campaign and other socially oriented schemes being launched by the Government . 
At the same time , I may point out that CPSEs are custodians of public wealth and , as such , they necessarily need to ensure continued compliance with the best standards of corporate governance and transparency . 
The CPSEs have , over time , contributed greatly towards fulfilling their Corporate Social Responsibility obligations . 
I am sure they will continue with these activities , designed for the upliftment of needy sections of our society , in the future also as mandated under the Companies Act , 2013 . 
I once again compliment SCOPE for its initiative in instituting the SCOPE Meritorious Awards with the objective of identifying and recognizing outstanding performers in various segments of business activity . 
I am informed that a distinguished jury has selected the award winners this year after a rigorous exercise . 
I congratulate all the award winners and wish them the very best in their future endeavours . 
I also encourage others to emulate the example set by those who have won awards today . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE ASSOCHAM SUMMIT ON LIVELIHOOD SECURITY
I am happy to be here today to inaugurate the Summit on " Livelihood Security : Realizing the vision for 1 . 3 billion Indians” and receive the first copy of the Report on this subject released a while ago . 
To begin with , let me compliment ASSOCHAM , one of the frontier industry associations of our country , for organizing this conference on an issue touching a wide spectrum of our society . 
There is a compelling need to provide livelihood security to those in the lower rungs of the socio - economic ladder . 
Additionally , there is a binding obligation to realize the dreams of the aspirational generation of young Indians . 
All these , when India with 2 . 4 percent of the world’s geographical area has seventeen percent of its population , pose formidable challenge . 
At this Meet , I anticipate an honest appraisal of issues concerning livelihood security and expect solutions that will guide policy makers . 
Livelihood is a fundamental ingredient for decent human existence . 
Without this important pre - requisite , people suffer denial of access from the common amenities of life . 
Food , shelter , education and healthcare become restrictive to someone without a stable livelihood . 
Therefore , any policy in the socio - economic domain has livelihood provision at its core , whether or not it espouses such an objective explicitly . 
Lack of livelihood opportunities manifests itself in several forms of deprivation ; most glaringly , poverty . 
In India , the high incidence of poverty of over 60 percent that prevailed six decades ago have come down to below 30 per cent now . 
About 85 million people came out of poverty during the period 2009 - 10 to 2011 - 12 . 
Even then , a sizeable number of about 270 million remained below the poverty line as of 2011 - 12 . 
Our goal now is ‘poverty elimination’ ; not merely ‘poverty alleviation’ . 
The poor has to be the first claimants , and hence , the focal point of development activity . 
To wipe out the curse of poverty , the most potent tool is job creation . 
Policies and programmes aimed at generating employment have to concentrate on the specific needs of this vulnerable segment . 
In 2005 , we made right to employment a legal entitlement , which gave us teeth in our fight against poverty . 
The bulk of the poor in India , about four - fifth , reside in rural areas . 
Livelihood security for the rural population , therefore , has to receive strong impetus . 
Agriculture , which is the backbone of India’s economy , is a crucial sector for the rural economy as well . 
A sound agricultural system is indispensable for attaining a host of objectives like poverty eradication , food adequacy , nutritional security , expansion in rural employment and higher rural incomes . 
The occupational security for an incredibly large number of rural households hinges on agriculture . 
There are millions of farmers tilling on small and marginal holdings . 
Our focus has to be on innovations for low cost technologies , machines and tools to transform subsistence farming into a viable and rewarding profession . 
Our challenge has to be in reaching out to the last farmland and equipping them with best practices in cultivation . 
Our efforts have to be directed at raising the low level of farm productivity in order to enhance farmer remuneration . 
A large rural population exerts load on the farming sector for employment . 
This has resulted in under - employment in agriculture and even disguised employment , a situation of more people being engaged than what is required . 
To lift the pressure off the farm sector , more jobs in the non - farm sector are required to be created through a paradigm shift from primary to secondary agriculture . 
The food processing sector provides a window , linking industry with agriculture and generating jobs in rural areas and small townships . 
Developing this sunrise sector calls for greater investment in infrastructure like cold chains , handling , packaging and transportation . 
The Government has recently launched measures aimed at emancipation of the poor and the neglected . 
Under the ‘Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana’ , villages will be adopted for provision of improved basic amenities and greater access to rights and entitlements . 
They will be converted into model villages for replication elsewhere . 
The ‘Digital India’ programme envisages wide - spread availability of e - infrastructure to make our country a digitally - empowered society and knowledge economy . 
Similarly , the financial inclusion programme will cover all habitations with banking facilities and provide all households bank accounts , RuPay cards , financial literacy , micro - insurance and unorganized sector pension . 
I am confident that these determined efforts will lead to an outpouring of socio - economic benefits including greater livelihood opportunities . 
India’s demographic dynamism will position us as the largest supplier of workforce in the world in another decade . 
By 2021 , the proportion of working age population is expected to be 64 percent . 
We have the largest young population in the world . 
By 2020 , the average age of an Indian will be 29 years , 8 years younger than an American or a Chinese . 
Not only do we have to find gainful employment to engage our growing manpower , we also have to equip them with capacity and expertise to make this impending demographic dividend count . 
A skilled working population at par with the best in the world can reap dividends like none other . 
A multi - modal approach is necessary . 
The manufacturing sector has to be invigorated as the potential of this sector as a mass employment generator is immense . 
I have great hopes that the investor - friendly initiative of ‘Make in India’ will lead our economy to be a manufacturing hub of low cost but high quality products . 
Job creation and capacity building has to complement one another . 
Skill development on a massive scale , of say 500 million persons by 2022 as envisaged by the National Policy on Skill Development , is required . 
The onus is on National Skill Development Corporation and other agencies to impart skills maintaining requisite standards and make available the targeted number of skilled personnel . 
Generating interest amongst youth to acquire new skills or upgrade existing skills call for monetary incentives . 
A freeze in fresh farm jobs owing to over - employment and increasing inability of the non - farm sector in rural areas to absorb excess rural workforce have led to the teeming of manpower in urban areas . 
Employment generation in the urban sector posits a tough challenge in a scenario of skill gap and urban poverty . 
To enable the urban poor to manage the external environment and access resources , financial cooperative structures have to be promoted . 
The National Urban Livelihood Mission is playing a crucial role in unleashing the capabilities of the poor to generate sustainable livelihoods . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF THE SCOPE MERITORIOUS AWARDS
I am indeed happy to be amidst you on this occasion of the presentation of the SCOPE Meritorious Awards for the year 2012 - 13 . 
I would like to compliment the Department of Public Enterprises ( DPE ) and Standing Conference of Public Enterprises ( SCOPE ) for organizing this event which provides recognition to the efforts being made by our CPSEs in a variety of areas such as Environmental Excellence & Sustainable Development ; Corporate Governance ; Corporate Social Responsibility & Responsiveness ; Research and Development and Technology Development & Innovation . 
The Central Public Sector Enterprises were set up immediately after independence to occupy the commanding heights of the economy and to channelize investment in areas which were critical to our efforts at development and self - reliance . 
The total investment in our 277 CPSEs stood at more than Rs . 8 . 5 lakh crores as on 31stMarch , 2013 . 
Operational CPSEs had a turnover of approximately Rs . 19 . 45 lakh crores , with the aggregate net profit of profit - making CPSEs amounting to Rs . 1 . 43 lakh crores during 2012 - 13 . 
Market capitalization of 46 listed CPSEs stood at more than Rs . 11 . 16 lakh crores as on 31st March , 2013 . 
These figures clearly demonstrate the pivotal role that the CPSEs play in our economy . 
As envisaged at the time of their creation , they have proved to be the backbone of our developmental effort and are rightly recognized as drivers of growth in infrastructure and other critical sectors of the economy . 
The Government has taken a number of steps to improve the functioning of CPSEs . 
These include empowerment of Boards of Maharatna , Navratna and Miniratna CPSEs , professionalization of Boards of CPSEs and strengthening of performance evaluation systems . 
These steps have contributed significantly in creating a positive and conducive policy framework for CPSEs . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , India today stands at the cusp of a transformative phase which , I firmly believe , will successfully place us in the league of developed nations over the next two decades . 
In the last ten years itself , we have scripted a wonderful success story emerging as one of the leading economies of the world and the third largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity . 
From 2004 - 05 to 2013 - 14 , our economy grew at an average rate of 7 . 6 per cent per year . 
Due to the continuing global economic slowdown and other factors , our GDP growth rate was subdued at below five per cent during the last two years . 
I am , however , happy to share that the green shoots of recovery are already visible . 
In the first quarter of the current financial year , the Indian economy achieved a growth rate of 5 . 7 per cent . 
Various steps taken towards fiscal consolidation have shown positive results . 
Inflation has decelerated over the past three months and we hope to contain it below 5 % through a judicious mix of policy measures . 
India now ranks second in the world in both wheat and rice production . 
A record food grains production last year helped the agriculture sector to register a growth of 4 . 7 per cent in 2013 - 14 . 
A number of measures aimed at investment revival , strengthening macro - economic stability and ramping up infrastructure will certainly posit India back into the high growth trajectory of 7 - 8 per cent . 
I must , in this context , make special mention to the Prime Minister’s ‘Make in India’ campaign which has recently been launched by Government to transform India into a truly world - class , global manufacturing hub . 
I believe that our CPSEs have a vital role in making this a reality . 
They have , over the years , established excellent manufacturing facilities in various parts of the country . 
We have one of the largest markets in the world and there is no dearth of demand for competitively priced , quality products . 
We should aim not only at catering to our huge domestic demand but also towards high quality product development and greater access to foreign markets . 
This would not only create adequate employment opportunities for our youth but also raise standards of living across . 
This expansion of operations to cater to both domestic and foreign markets can only come after making a realistic assessment of business potential and ensuring that our products conform to international standards . 
For this purpose , latest technology needs to be harnessed , both through suitable industry - academia linkages and by entering into strategic alliances with entities which possess these technologies . 
It is also imperative that attention is focused on vendor development and mandatory procurement through small and medium enterprises . 
This would not only develop local industry but also boost domestic manufacturing and usher in a culture of entrepreneurship in the country . 
I would , in particular , draw your attention on the need to innovate while doing business . 
An ever changing and dynamic business scenario throws up newer and complex challenges which call for innovative solutions . 
Over the years our CPSEs have developed a certain way of doing business . 
In today’s scenario it is critical to re - examine , re - engineer and reinvent processes in order to continuously stay ahead of market requirements and expectations . 
I would , accordingly , advise all of you to critically re - appraise existing systems and procedures and develop newer , more efficient ways of doing business with a view to taking full advantage of the latent potentialities that exist , both on the material and human front , in your organisations . 
The CPSEs have actively partnered Government in implementing its social and economic policies . 
I am confident they will continue to take the lead in the ‘Swachh Bharat’ campaign and other socially oriented schemes being launched by the Government . 
At the same time , I may point out that CPSEs are custodians of public wealth and , as such , they necessarily need to ensure continued compliance with the best standards of corporate governance and transparency . 
The CPSEs have , over time , contributed greatly towards fulfilling their Corporate Social Responsibility obligations . 
I am sure they will continue with these activities , designed for the upliftment of needy sections of our society , in the future also as mandated under the Companies Act , 2013 . 
I once again compliment SCOPE for its initiative in instituting the SCOPE Meritorious Awards with the objective of identifying and recognizing outstanding performers in various segments of business activity . 
I am informed that a distinguished jury has selected the award winners this year after a rigorous exercise . 
I congratulate all the award winners and wish them the very best in their future endeavours . 
I also encourage others to emulate the example set by those who have won awards today . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE ASSOCHAM SUMMIT ON LIVELIHOOD SECURITY
I am happy to be here today to inaugurate the Summit on " Livelihood Security : Realizing the vision for 1 . 3 billion Indians” and receive the first copy of the Report on this subject released a while ago . 
To begin with , let me compliment ASSOCHAM , one of the frontier industry associations of our country , for organizing this conference on an issue touching a wide spectrum of our society . 
There is a compelling need to provide livelihood security to those in the lower rungs of the socio - economic ladder . 
Additionally , there is a binding obligation to realize the dreams of the aspirational generation of young Indians . 
All these , when India with 2 . 4 percent of the world’s geographical area has seventeen percent of its population , pose formidable challenge . 
At this Meet , I anticipate an honest appraisal of issues concerning livelihood security and expect solutions that will guide policy makers . 
Livelihood is a fundamental ingredient for decent human existence . 
Without this important pre - requisite , people suffer denial of access from the common amenities of life . 
Food , shelter , education and healthcare become restrictive to someone without a stable livelihood . 
Therefore , any policy in the socio - economic domain has livelihood provision at its core , whether or not it espouses such an objective explicitly . 
Lack of livelihood opportunities manifests itself in several forms of deprivation ; most glaringly , poverty . 
In India , the high incidence of poverty of over 60 percent that prevailed six decades ago have come down to below 30 per cent now . 
About 85 million people came out of poverty during the period 2009 - 10 to 2011 - 12 .

To enable the urban poor to manage the external environment and access resources , financial cooperative structures have to be promoted . 
The National Urban Livelihood Mission is playing a crucial role in unleashing the capabilities of the poor to generate sustainable livelihoods . 
Livelihood security is incomplete without the provision of social security . 
In India , over 85 percent of the working population or an estimated 400 million people work in the unorganized sector . 
Schemes like ‘Swavalamban’ which deals with unorganized sector pension have to fully cover the unorganized sector workforce for a significant impact on livelihood protection . 
To make a decisive change in the livelihood security of Indians , the challenges are many and time limited . 
But I am certain that with the combined efforts of all stakeholders – government , industry , non - governmental agencies and the community at large – we will be able to extend to our countrymen enormous livelihood prospects . 
The industry can create mechanisms for income opportunities and capacity building under CSR initiatives mandated by the Companies Act of 2013 . 
I hope that this Summit will discuss issues threadbare and make recommendations in the right perspective . 
I once again commend ASSOCHAM for convening this event . 
Let me conclude in the words of Mahatma Gandhi : " Happiness depends on what you can give ; not what you can get” . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE 27TH CONFERENCE OF ACCOUNTANTS GENERAL ON ‘PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH PUBLIC AUDIT’
At the very outset , I would like to express my deep appreciation to CAG and his office for associating me with this Conference . 
I am happy to be present for the inauguration of the 27th Conference of Accountants General . 
Let me begin by complimenting the Audit Institution in India , which has a history of over 150 years . 
In 1858 , this supreme audit authority was called the Accountant General . 
The authority was re - designated four times before the adoption of the Constitution when the term Comptroller and Auditor General ( CAG ) of India was provided . 
Under Article 148 of our Constitution , the CAG is an independent constitutional authority which is neither a part of the legislature nor the executive . Article 151 prescribes that the reports of the CAG relating to the accounts of the Union and the States are submitted to the President or the Governor of the State respectively and they shall cause the reports to be laid in the Parliament or the State Legislative Assembly . 
Evidently , the founding fathers of ourConstitution had envisaged a prominent role for public audit in our country’s governance and accountability framework . 
The concept is not new . 
In the old treatises , ancient texts of administration , particularly Arthashastra , Kautilya prescribed extensive arrangements for accounting and auditing . 
The organizational structure for financial management comprised two distinct hierarchies - a Treasurer and a Comptroller - Auditor – both were directly responsible to the King . 
He placed high premium on public audit conducted by incorruptible officials . 
I am happy to note that during this Conference , the participants will have the opportunity to deliberate on the achievement of this vision . 
I also take this opportunity to mention that all CAGs so far , without any exception , have displayed exemplary courage , integrity and excellent performance . 
Good governance is the exercise of power , within the framework of the Constitution , for efficient and effective management of our economic and social resources for the well - being of the vast multitude of the people , through the institutions of state . 
Audit institutions play an enabling role in ushering in good governance in democratic functioning . 
Accountability of public functionaries is an integral part of any good governance framework , more so in a democratic polity . 
Accountability of public servants extends to maintenance of probity in official dealings , compliance with legal obligations and commitment to efficient delivery of public service . 
In recent years , there has been a global surge in demand for accountability of those entrusted with governance . 
In a parliamentary democracy like ours , the executive is held accountable to the Legislature . 
The reports of the CAG submitted to the Legislature play a seminal role in the enforcement of accountability . 
The audits by the Indian Audit & Accounts Department under the CAG cover the three tiers of government and other instrumentalities of the State . 
The CAG is also the only supreme audit institution with an accounting mandate as well . 
The Constitution has placed this institution at a vantage point providing it with insight into performance of different agencies engaged in financial administration of our country . 
The broad audit mandate provides the CAG access to programme and project implementation at national and sub - national levels . 
You scrutinize the allocation and flow of public funds between different implementing authorities . 
Thereafter , you evaluate and report on their prompt and effective utilization , disseminate good practices and stimulate course correction through identification of bottlenecks . 
The perspective available to you by virtue of auditing multiple governance entities provides valuable inputs for promotion of good governance in the country . 
Audit is a means to an end rather than an end in itself . 
While audit findings are a barometer of good governance , their utility is manifested only when all the stakeholders , particularly the Executive , Legislature and citizens believe in the credibility of these findings and use them for enhancing the quality of governance . 
This casts a great responsibility on the public auditor to conduct audit professionally with utmost diligence and independence , and to report in a fair and balanced manner . 
Both the public auditor and the audited entity have to recognize that the objective of audit is ultimately to improve the implementation of governance strategies . 
Towards this end , audit should be considered a tool for improvement . 
Accountability of the Executive stems from the requirement ofrendering of an accountto the Legislature that authorized it to tax and expend . 
Here I would like to mention that more time needs to be devoted in Parliament for detailed scrutiny of financial proposals and financial matters . 
The Audit report is a valuable input for the authorities empowered to hold a public functionary to account , in making judgments on their level of performance and recommending improvements . 
In India , this responsibility is vested with the Public Accounts Committee and Committee on Public Undertakings that act on behalf of the Legislature . 
Effective functioning of these legislative committees , and close association between them and the audit authorities are a blueprint of audit effectiveness , and through it , of governance practices . 
There is no static finality about the scope and objective of public audit . 
They are shaped by societal concerns which find expression through legislative enactments and judicial pronouncements . 
The frontiers of public audit have been the subject of public debate and litigation in our country recently . 
Judicial verdicts have underscored the paramount role of our audit institution in ensuring parliamentary accountability in use of public resources by any entity , whether in the public or private domain . 
The right of CAG to carry out performance audits of government entities and to verify underlying transactions of even private concerns to provide assurance about the State receiving its legitimate share of revenues arising out of the use of public resources is now well established . 
This paradigm shift in your audit mandate encourages development of appropriate policies and procedures to govern your audit process . 
It calls for substantial capacity development in your Department . 
I hope that the recommendations of the Conference on the sub - themes ‘Emerging areas of audit’ and ‘Capacity building in Indian Audit & Accounts Department’ will address these concerns . 
The platforms used for delivery of public service influences the conduct of audit . 
As ‘Digital India’ becomes the backbone of government functioning , it calls for transformation in the traditional methods of audit . 
The leverage that e - governance can provide for improving efficiency , cost and coverage of audit have to be utilized well by revisiting your standard operating procedures . 
In States where the CAG has an accounting role , there is scope to improve services without compromising on due diligence . 
You must proactively engage with the States in their programmes for modernization of government accounts and financial management systems . 
Partnerships already initiated by you have to continue to make accounting an effective tool for accountability . 
Time - bound delivery of goods and services by public functionaries is the right of citizens . 
It is not a bounty from the State . Many States have legislated for prompt delivery of public services . 
The institution of CAG can facilitate successful implementation of this legal right by reporting through its compliance audits the achievement of these performance standards by public authorities . 
Sir Walter of Henley’s 13thCentury Treatise of Housebandry mentions and I quote : 
" The Auditors ought to be faithful and prudent , knowing their business… . It is not necessary so to speak to the Auditors about making audits for they ought to be so prudent , and so faithful , and so knowing in their business , that they have no need of others’ teaching about things connected with the accounts” . 
The value of an audit system , where no outsider prescribes as to how to go about auditing , is universally recognized . 
The institution of CAG of India is no exception . 
Such trust in the capability and independence of your institution also casts a huge responsibility on you to keep your knowledge up - to - date and to uphold highest professional standards . 
Knowledge is fast multiplying . 
I am confident that you will be up to the task in keeping yourself abreast of latest developments in diverse fields of contemporary relevance . 
Remember that as watchdogs of national public finances , the institution of CAG has a positive and pre - eminent role in accelerating national development . 
With these words , I conclude . I wish you all the very best in your endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE RELEASE FUNCTION AND RECEIVE THE FIRST COPY OF ‘TULSI SMRITI GRANTH’
I am happy to be present at this function for the release of ‘Tulsi Smriti Granth’ , which has been brought out on the eve of the Birth Centenary Celebration of Acharya Tulsi . 
At the outset , let me thank the Acharya Tulsi Janam Shatabdi Samaroh Samiti for the opportunity to receive the first copy of this book . 
I also avail of this occasion to compliment all those who contributed or have been associated with this commemorative volume on the great saint , Acharya Tulsi . 
Indiais an ancient civilization marked by rich culture , philosophy and spirituality . 
Sages , monks and spiritual leaders have made significant contributions over the ages towards India’s spiritual beliefs . 
They have provided valuable direction benefitting the masses . 
In our country’s glorious tradition of self - enlightenment , Lord Mahavira occupies an eminent position . 
Through his divine preaching ofahimsa ( non - violence ) , anekant ( non - absolution ) and aparigraha ( non - possession ) , he aimed at spiritual upliftment of the people . 
Deeply concerned with social issues of the time , Lord Mahavira professed solutions that helped alleviate problems of the masses . 
Following Lord Mahavira’s spiritual footprints , a chain of Jain Acharyas appeared from time to time through the centuries . 
They helped in nourishing Indian culture with fundamental and interminable values . 
Acharya Bhikshu was one of those eminent Acharyas . 
He stood against the misinterpretation of religious texts and doctrines . 
He provided true meaning to the age - old and fundamental strings of spirituality . 
The ' Terapanth ' sect was born out of that pious resolve . 
The ninth successor of Acharya Bhikshu was Acharya Tulsi . 
Acharya Tulsi was born in 1914 , at a time when India was starting to transcend from a traditional to a modern nation . 
At the tender age of eleven , he started delving into the problems of the world and seeking solutions , and transformed into a Jain monk . 
Under the spiritual guidance of Acharya Kalughani , he undertook in - depth study ofaagamas and other texts of philosophy andnyaya in a short span of eleven years . 
This made him a scholar of multiple subjects . 
Due to his extraordinary talent and vision , he became the successor Acharya at the age of 22 . 
From then on , he started a journey of exploration of new vistas for human development . 
Acharyaji was a humanitarian , a peace activist , and a torch - bearer of moral awakening in our country . 
He rendered service for more than sixty years , during which he toiled hard for the transformation of the nation by transforming the individual . 
He set up a mission for ' Moral awakening of the country ' and embarked on a long journey walking barefoot across the nation . 
He travelled more than one lakh kilometers reaching out to the elite of the society and the marginalized alike and to the rural and urban belt of the country . 
Under the banner of Anuvrat Movement , which he led from its beginning in 1936 until his demise in 1994 , Acharya Tulsi met writers , politicians , philosophers , poets and spiritual leaders . 
He shared his concern for national integration . 
He voiced his opinion against social evils like suppression of women , dowry system , torturing of widows , untouchability and veiling of women . 
He launched a special campaign for de - addiction . 
Due to Acharyaji’s inspiration , thousands of people got registered and de - addicted successfully . 
Acharya Tulsi was an eloquent public speaker . 
Through his thought provoking and inspirational discourses , he enlightened the people . 
His thoughts and philosophy are contained in more than hundred books written in different languages and in varied styles . 
His writing espouses virtues like rationality , practicality , solution - orientation , relevance and harmony . 
He was a keen proponent of world peace . 
When the Atom Bomb was used in 1945 , Acharya Tulsi wrote an article titled ' Message of peace to unquiet world ' . 
Reading about the ways Acharyaji suggested for maintenance of world peace , Mahatma Gandhi had observed : 
" How good it would be if the world lives in accordance with this great man ' s precepts " . 
As recognition of Acharya Tulsi ' s significant endeavour in bringing individual transformation , social reformation , religious harmony and national integration , he was conferred several honours like Indira Gandhi National Unity Award , Bharat Jyoti , Vak Pati Samman and Hakim Sur Khan Award . 
To dedicate his life completely in the service of humanity and spirituality , he renounced his acharya - ship willingly and appointed Acharya Mahapragya as his successor . 
He established a web of organizations to pursue his noble objectives . 
The Jain Vishwa Bharati Institute , the All India Terapanth Women Congregation which has around 60 , 000 members today , and the All India Terapanth Youth Congregation which has more than 300 branches and over 40 , 000 members , are working for Anuvrat , in the field of meditation , jeevan vigyan ( or the science of living ) andahimsa samavaya . 
The ascetic group , Anuvrat , with more than 800 members , represents a strong force championing humanitarian causes . 
One of the important tasks undertaken by them is the editing of Jainaagamas , which is a ground - breaking achievement and I congratulate the group for the same . 
At this release of Tulsi Smriti Granth today , it is gladdening to see several leading spiritual lights , besides followers , attending the function . 
Every word inscribed in this book is an article of faith that followers should bear in their hearts for life . 
The lives of people in these modern times are both a matter of opportunity and challenge , of stability and turbulence . 
Acharyaji’s teachings and words of wisdom hold great relevance for moral upliftment of individuals and transformation of nations alike . 
I earnestly hope that the messages contained in the Granth will travel far and wide and imbibed by the people . 
I am also happy to learn that Acharya Mahashraman , who is the eleventh supreme head of the ‘Terapanth’ , is undertaking an Ahimsa Yatra from Delhi in November , this year . 
I wish this expedition all success . May this journey on foot benefit the masses and people of our country . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF RELEASE OF A COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP ON ANAGARIKA DHARMAPALA
It gives me great pleasure to be present here today to release a Commemorative Postage Stamp to pay tribute to the great Srilankan Buddhist revivalist and writer Anagarika Dharmapala . 
I congratulate the Department of Posts for taking this initiative of bringing out a Commemorative Postage Stamp on Anagarika Dharmapala . 
I hope that this gesture will contribute towards further strengthening the bilateral ties between India and Sri Lanka and bring the two nations closer . 
Historically , India and Sri Lanka have remained natural allies . 
The relations between the two countries have withstood the test of time and socio - cultural exchanges for centuries have fostered further close cooperation in various fields . 
Both the countries have much to learn and imbibe from each other in order to resolve various issues which are the legacies of a protracted period of colonial rule . 
I am confident that the relations between the two countries will continue to further strengthen in the coming years to the mutual benefit of our two peoples . 
Buddhism , one of the major religions in the world began in India and is a faith based on non - violence and pursuit of spiritual excellence rather than material aggrandizement . 
It’s principles continue to have great relevance even in this age . 
Buddhism promotes peace and stability and strongly advocates the spirit of compassion and tolerance . 
It aims to wean the humanity away from war and skirmishes and inspires people to channelize their collective energy towards the betterment of society . 
This stamp release on one of the apostles of Buddhism , once again reminds us to work relentlessly and collectively to ensure an era of peace , stability and friendly bilateral and multilateral ties in order to create an enabling environment for the rapid socio - economic development of the people . 
In this backdrop , it becomes much more imperative to recall the achievements and safeguard for posterity the memories of the great Buddhist thinker and preacher , Anagarika Dharmapala who practically lived and breathed Buddhist ideals and worked till the last to revive Buddhism . 
Anagarika Dharmapala , was one of the founding contributors of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism and was also a pioneer in the revival ofBuddhism in India . 
He not only embraced Buddhism but also lent it Sinhalese nationalist character . 
He waged a protracted struggle to protect and conserve the foundations of Buddhism in it’s place of birth , India . 
He joined the Theosophical Society and spearheaded the reform and revival of Ceylonese Buddhism and it’s propagation . 
He later entered the order of Buddhist monks as Venerable Sri Devamitta Dharmapala and is considered a Bodhisattva in Sri Lanka . 
He was ordained a bhikkhu at Sarnath in 1933 and he died there in December of the same year . 
In 1891 , Anagarika Dharmapala went on apilgrimageto the MahabodhiTemple at Bodh Gaya , where the Buddha had attainedenlightment . 
He decided to work towards restoring it’s glory . 
Accordingly , theMaha Bodhi Society atColombowas founded in 1891 and one of its primary aims was the restoration to Buddhist control of theMahabodhi temple atBodh Gaya . 
Many people remember Anagarika Dharmapala for his religious zeal . 
But there was another aspect to this towering figure - his practical vision regarding the alleviation of poverty . 
The voice of Anagarika Dharmapala was also a significant factor in Ceylon’s historical struggle for freedom from the British Raj . 
He spoke of the importance of a firm educational and economic foundation if the struggle for freedom was to succeed . 
He also concentrated on establishing schools and hospitals in his country . 
He had a vision of a newly emerging Ceylon , which could effectively link up with other countries and forge ahead . 
In 1893 Dharmapala was invited to attend theWorld Parliament of Religions inChicago as a representative of " Southern Buddhism " - which was the term applied at that time to theTheravada . 
There he met Swami Vivekananda and like him , he was also a great success at the Parliament . 
On this occasion , as I pay my humble homage to this towering personality , I once again congratulate the Department of Posts for bringing out the Commemorative Postage Stamp on Anagarika Dharmapala who worked selflessly all his life with a missionary zeal to propagate Buddhist ideals and to restore the glory of Buddhism . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE DURING THE BUSINESS MEETING IN FINPRO , HElSINKI
It gives me great pleasure to address this distinguished gathering of business participants . Other than working on business deals , such events are important platforms for deepening mutual engagement and interaction , and providing an opportunity to think creatively about ways to develop the potential of our relationship . 
India and Finland have traditionally enjoyed warm and friendly relations . 
Our bilateral relations have become increasingly multi - faceted and have acquired a substantive content with enhanced trade and investment levels . 
There are substantial prospects of cooperation in the field of technology and innovation between both our countries . 
We have set up institutional mechanisms to encourage exchange of economic and commercial information , identify possibilities of investments and tie - ups in different areas , disseminate information on the diversification of trade and to acquaint the business community of both countries about commercial opportunities . 
The Indo - Finnish Joint Commission is one such forum . In addition , there are several sector - specific initiatives like a Memorandum of Cooperation in the Road Transportation sector , S & T Cooperation Agreement and an MOU between the Department of Science and Technology of India and TEKES - the Finnish funding agency for technology and innovation . 
An Indo - Finnish Working Group on Innovation was created in 2011 . 
Both countries have also signed an Agreement for cooperation in the field of Information Security . 
A Joint Working Group ( JWG ) on Environment has been holding regular meetings and another Joint Working Group on Clean Technology and Waste Management has been set up . 
In recent years , there has been a substantive growth in our economic and commercial relations . 
In spite of the global economic downturn , bilateral trade has seen a substantial increase and has reached approximately US $ 1 . 5 billion in 2013 , which is an encouraging development . 
However , I am of the firm opinion , that this does not do justice to the true potential for economic and trade co - operation that exists between our two nations . 
We need to explore the untapped areas where opportunities exist . 
A large business delegation in specific sectors of interest is accompanying me . 
These captains of industry represent the sectors of Financial Services , Ports & Defence , Seafood , Oil & Gas , Energy , Consulting Services , Healthcare , Chemicals , Hydro Products , Aquaculture , Information Technology , Infrastructure , Utilities & Renewable Energy , Manufacturing and Pharmaceuticals . 
India has emerged as one of the largest global economies and the resilience of our economy is evident from the fact that the impact of the global financial crisis has been far less severe in India than other countries . 
The strong growth performance that marked our economy in the past decade , when we grew at an average rate of 7 . 6 per cent per year , has generated keen investor interest in India . 
Though our GDP growth during the last two years at sub - five per cent was rather subdued , it was still higher than most major economies barring China . 
There are now positive signals emanating that suggest a recovery is round the corner . Our economy grew at 5 . 7 per cent during the first quarter of 2014 - 15 . 
Our external sector has strengthened ; the exchange rate has stabilized ; fiscal consolidation measures have improved our fiscal position ; price levels have come down ; figures from recent months show that the manufacturing sector is in the nascent stages of a comeback ; food grains production reached record levels last year to help the agriculture sector grow at a robust 4 . 7 per cent in 2013 - 14 . 
With measures aimed at stimulating greater investor interest , strengthening macro - economic fundamentals and rejuvenating the infrastructure sector , the Indian economy is poised to once again achieve a 7 - 8 per cent rate of growth . 
The Foreign Direct Investment regime in India has been progressively liberalised , with restrictions on foreign investments gradually being removed and procedures being simplified . 
Presently , our Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) policy is widely seen to be amongst the most liberal in the emerging economies , allowing up to 100 % FDI under the automatic route in several of our sectors and activities . 
Owing to these reasons , India is rated as the fourth most attractive location for FDI for 2014 - 2016 . 
We have also recently enhanced the FDI cap in crucial sectors like insurance and defence manufacturing and permitted 100 per cent FDI in railways infrastructure . 
This is expected to act as a further boost for external investors . 
I am , therefore , slightly surprised that FDI equity inflows from Finland into India since April , 2000 have only been 288 million US Dollars , representing only 0 . 13 per cent of the total FDI equity inflows of 228 billion US Dollars into our country during this period . 
I am confident that greater B2B interaction would create better awareness of the vast economic opportunities that lie within our economy . Finnish companies would find it immensely worthwhile to come and invest in a growing economy like ours . 
We have renewed our thrust on the manufacturing sector in India . 
In 2011 we unveiled a policy that envisaged increasing the contribution of manufacturing to our GDP from 15 percent presently to 25 percent by 2022 . 
We remain committed to pursuing our objective of making India a manufacturing hub . 
We are well on course to becoming a manufacturing base and an export hub for diverse goods ranging from agricultural products to automobile components to high - end services . 
Many of our industrial sectors today are globally competitive and internationally acclaimed for their quality . 
The Indian government is committed to a business - friendly environment – impediment free , predictable , facilitatory and transparent . 
To that end , India has embarked on an ambitious ‘Make in India’ program to make the country an investor - friendly destination by setting up single window clearances , e - Business portals and Investor Facilitation Cells . 
I am confident that Finnish investors shall take optimum advantage of the new policies unveiled . 
The infrastructure sector is a focus area for our economy . 
In the next few years , we envisage a spend of a trillion US Dollars on infrastructure . 
To facilitate greater investment in infrastructure , we have set up facilities and schemes such as Industrial Corridors , the Industrial Infrastructure Up - gradation Scheme , National Investment and Manufacturing Zones , Industrial clusters and Smart Cities . 
Development of infrastructure will not only propel economic growth in our country but shall also enable foreign companies that invest in India to participate in and partake the benefits of our growth . 
Both our countries signed the Agreement on Economic Cooperation in 2010 , which shows the importance we attach to expanding bilateral co - operation and partnership . 
A number of Indian IT firms are executing contracts in Finland . 
Over 130 Finnish companies are operating in India in various sectors including power equipment , heavy machinery , telecommunications , IT , water treatment , bio - fuel , education , environment , renewable energy and manufacturing sector . 
Finland ' s innovation system is one of the best in the world . 
Finland has developed sophisticated technologies in areas such as communications and information technology , energy , shipbuilding , manufacturing , biotechnology , environment , healthcare and infrastructure services . 
There is , accordingly , ample scope for collaboration in areas of innovation , clean technologies and waste management , environment , renewable energy and skill development and training . 
Government of India is very keen to encourage the companies of both countries to explore opportunities of collaboration in areas hitherto unexplored . 
Finland ' s " India Action Plan " launched in April 2013 is a testimony of Finland ' s initiative for expanding economic cooperation with India . 
Opening of a Fin - Node Centre in Delhi in September 2011 is another indication of the importance the Government of Finland attaches to bilateral economic relations . 
Tourism is another area of immense potential in our bilateral relations . 
You would be happy to know that tourists from Finland can obtain visas on arrival at Indian airports . 
Apart from business , the Higher Education Sector in India is also expanding at a fast clip and many new institutions have been established . 
We now need to focus on fundamental research in science and technology to help us manage better , issues such as managing and mitigating climate change , ensuring food and drinking water security for our people , and finding sustainable energy sources . 
In modern civilizations , Knowledge is power . 
I am aware that the Finnish education system is one of the best in the world and scores very highly in international ratings . 
India and Finland need to collaborate intensively in the educational sector so as to add to the diversity of our campuses and to build capacity . 
I am particularly happy that during this visit several MoUs and Agreements have been formalized between Indian educational and scientific institutions and Finnish universities . 
This will hopefully lead to the creation of an ecosystem between our countries which facilitates exchange of students and faculties and also creates ample opportunities for innovation through joint courses and degrees . 
A growing India offers opportunities across sectors in an investor friendly environment for Finnish companies . 
India is keen to further invigorate our bilateral engagement under the newly formed government which has chosen infrastructure and manufacturing as two key focus areas . 
It is my pleasure to invite Finnish businesses to participate in the 2nd India - Central Europe Business Forum to be held in India in the first quarter of 2015 . 
I once again thank you for inviting me to share my views on the India growth story and wish all of you the very best in your deliberations . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE TO THE PARLIAMENT OF FINLAND
I thank you for your kind words of welcome . 
It is indeed a great privilege for me to be here and to address you in this august and historic House of the People . 
I extend to all the Honourable Members of The Eduskunta and through you , to the people of Finland , the warm greetings of the people of the Republic of India . 
As the first country to give the right to vote and the right to stand for elections to all citizens of eligible age - regardless of wealth , race or social class , you are an exemplary democracy . 
It is well known that Finnish women were the first in the world to receive full political rights , including the right to stand for elections as well as the right to vote . 
As a result , it was as long ago as 1907 that the first batch of women was elected to your Parliament . 
There is another reason that I feel very much at home here . 
Having participated intensely in the deliberations and activities of the Indian Parliament for more than four decades , it gives me great pleasure to visit other great Parliaments of the world . 
I am particularly happy to be accompanied today by the Honourable Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises of the Government of India , Shri P . Radhakrishnan and a delegation of Honourable Members of Parliament from both Houses of the Indian Parliament comprising Shri Rajeev Shukla , Shri Anant Kumar Dattatreya Hegde , Dr . Kirit Premjibhai Solanki and Shri Babul Supriyo Baral . 
The Honourable Members accompanying me represent different political parties , regions , ethnic groups and sections of the Indian society . 
Our Parliament is a microcosm of India and symbolizes , in every sense , the unity , strength and diversity of the Indian people . 
As you may be aware , the recent elections in India were the largest democratic exercise of the right to vote in living history – we had a record turnout and the results were equally historic : for the first time in 30 years , the Indian electorate voted in a majority Government . 
My State Visit is taking place at a time when relations between our two Governments and our people have never been better . 
India and Finland have always shared close and cordial relations based on a shared commitment to strong multi - party democracy , open societies , rule of law , free press and independence of the judiciary . 
Since the visit of our first Prime Minister , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to Finland in 1957 , we have sustained a tradition of regular contacts and exchanges at both the political and official levels . 
This has contributed to enhanced mutual understanding between our Governments and peoples . 
Our points of view converge on many global and regional issues . 
India deeply appreciates Finland’s support for India’s candidature for a permanent seat in an expanded United Nations Security Council . 
We are committed to working closely with peace - loving nations to address regional and global issues of common interest including urgent issues such as combating terrorism , mitigating the effects of climate change and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals . 
India counts on the continued support of Finland in multilateral fora . 
India is happy to be an Observer of the Arctic Council . 
We are committed to further deepening its engagement with Member States and Permanent Participants . 
India will continue to deploy its significant polar research capabilities and scientific understanding for strengthening the work of the Arctic Council . 
At the bilateral level , we , in India , expect to intensify our ongoing co - operation with Finland in specific areas of shared interest and complementarities . 
Despite the global economic downturns there has been substantial growth in our economic and commercial relations , particularly in sectors such as oil and gas , shipping and maritime industries , renewable energy and IT services . 
Our two - way trade has crossed the 1 billion Euro mark . 
This , however , is not a reflection of the true potential for bilateral trade and commerce that exists between our two economies . 
I am confident that in the coming years there shall be far greater engagement between us in all areas - economic , geo - political , social and cultural . 
Our Government’s manifest desire to engage more substantively with the Nordic region cannot be conveyed better than through the composition of my delegation - which includes eminent educationists , scientists and businessmen . 
We hope to move forward with renewed vigour in all these areas . 
Finland’s technology in areas such as communications and information technology , energy , shipbuilding , manufacturing , biotechnology , environment , healthcare and infrastructure services is amongst the best in the world . 
India would like to take advantage of your expertise in these areas . 
The new Government in India is focused on growth and creation of employment opportunities . 
It is taking measures to encourage investments , revive the manufacturing sector in India , promote skills development , develop smart cities , address social issues and engage closely with partners in these areas . 
Business sentiments are positive and strong ; it is a period of opportunity in India . 
Almost 100 Finnish companies have invested over one billion euros in India in sectors such as environment and energy . 
Our bilateral co - operation in the field of science and technology , particularly bio - technology , has been exceedingly successful . 
Going forward , Finland could take advantage of the " Make in India " campaign which seeks to position India as a global manufacturing hub through a series of positive policy interventions . 
Excellency , India is a young nation with 65 % of the population below the age of 35 years . 
Upgrading their skills is a high priority for us . 
I am very pleased that during this visit several MOUs and agreements for co - operation are being signed between our premier educational institutions and Finnish Universities that will contribute to India’s efforts in this direction . 
India very much looks forward to intensifying the exchanges between our peoples . 
Our Parliamentarians and the India - Finland Parliamentary Friendship Group can , and must , play an instrumental role in this process . 
In this context , you will be interested to know , India has included Finland among the countries for whose citizens tourist visas can be issued on arrival . 
Finn Air ' s direct daily flights to Delhi and Mumbai will facilitate our tourism and business links . 
Excellency , I am optimistic and confident that the trust and fruitful co - operation between our Governments and peoples will further strengthen to our mutual benefit in the years to come . 
I thank you once again for inviting me to address this House . 
It is my pleasure to invite you and the distinguished Parliamentarians to visit India to get to know our land and our people . 
I wish you and the Honourable Members of Parliament every success in your endeavours for the people of Finland . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE STATE BANQUET HOSTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FINLAND
I am grateful for your gracious words . 
It is indeed a pleasure and a great honour for me to be here amidst this distinguished gathering in the Land of the Midnight Sun . 
I bring to the Government and the friendly people of Finland , warm greetings and goo d wishes of the Government and the people of the Republic of India . 
Excellency , at the very outset I would like to thank you for the warm welcome and hospitality accorded to me and to my delegation . 
We are delighted to be in Finland . 
We , in India , know Finland for the beauty of the Laplands and the industrious nature of its citizens . 
We see Finland as an advanced society that has smoothly and successfully developed into an efficiently functioning welfare State . 
We appreciate the Finnish value system that puts a premium on education and high productivity , encourages the spirit of enquiry and innovation and gives women equality in the true sense of the word . 
India attaches great value to its friendship and co - operation with Finland . 
The Government and the people of India and Finland have , over the years , developed a close and fruitful relationship of friendship and co - operation . 
We share a unique bond of reciprocated trust - based on our shared values and synergies . 
Though we may be separated by geographical distances , our co - operationhas , in recent years , become increasingly multifaceted , dynamic and significantly rewarding . 
Mr . President , our bilateral economic and commercial relations have grown in recent years . 
In 2013 , our bilateral trade crossed the one billion dollar mark . 
However , given the relative size of our economies and the wide convergence of interests in many areas , the present level of trade and investment needs to be substantially enhanced which I have no doubt , it will . 
We are grateful to Finland for standing by India on certain issues that we consider to be important and urgent . 
Finland has been steadfast in its support of India ' s consistent and principled stand on the issue of terrorism . 
We are grateful for your support for India ' s rightful claim to Permanent Membership of the United Nations Security Council . 
Indiaappreciates Finland’s strong economy and sophisticated technological capabilities . 
Finland has made tremendous advancements in infrastructure development , communications and information technology , clean energy , shipbuilding , manufacturing , biotechnology , healthcare and services . 
We would very much like to enhance our bilateral co - operation in these areas , learn from the successful experience and practices of Finland and join Finland in creating new and innovative products and technology . 
I am confident that the agreements that we have signed will open new avenues and many new opportunities for our people to work together for mutual benefit . 
India invites investors and entrepreneurs from Finland to look at India’s infrastructure sector and to join Indian counterparts in the " Make in India” initiative of the new Government . 
We look forward to new partnerships and collaborations in areas of common interest . 
Excellency in this age of global competitiveness , Finland’s advantage in world class innovation is a key distinguishing factor . 
The systems that you have put in place to linking research and innovation to industry is amongst the best in the world . 
This has helped Finland to develop advanced technology for its own industrial sector as well as for export . 
In your Parliamentary Committee for the Future , you have created a unique institutional capacity for guiding Government policy . 
There is much that India can learn from Finland . 
In India , we remember Finland for the Helsinki Summer Olympics of 1952 , where India won a Gold medal in Hockey , our national game , and a bronze medal in Wrestling . 
We alsorecall that our great philosopher and poet , Guru Rabindranath Tagore , referred to Finland in one of his poems titled ‘Apaghat’ ( Bombshell ) written during the Second World War . 
I am pleased that Gurudev Tagore’s work has been translated into the Finnish language and has been widely appreciated in Finland . 
We welcome the interest of the Finnish people in our culture and heritage . 
We invite them to visit India . Finland is one of the countries to whose citizens we are extending the visa on arrival facility . 
I have no doubt that in the days and years to come , such linkages will form the bedrock of an ever stronger friendship between our peoples . 
With these words , Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen , I request you to join me in raising a toast : 
·to the health and happiness of His Excellency , Mr . Sauli Niinisto , President of the Republic of Finland and Mrs . Jenni Haukio ; 
·to the continued success , progress , prosperity and well - being of the people of India and Finland ; and
·to the friendship and enduring cooperation between India and the friendly Republic of Finland . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT HELSINKI CITY HALL
I consider it a matter of great honour to receive the Medal of Honour of Helsinki . 
At the very outset , I would like to thank you for the warm reception accorded to me by the City Council of Helsinki . 
I am particularly happy to be here - especially as this visit is the first by a Head of State from India after a gap of 26 years . 
My discussions with His Excellency the President and my other meetings with the leadership of Finland have reinforced my confidence that the traditionally warm ties of friendship and co - operation between India and Finland will only intensify and strengthen in the days and years to come - to the mutual benefit of the people of India and Finland . 
Helsinki , the " Daughter of the Baltic Sea " is a fascinating and beautiful city . 
As I look about me at this vibrant city , and learn about its infrastructure and capacities , I see an ultra - modern , yet environmentally friendly city . 
It is a very significant fact that it was chosen to be the World Design Capital for 2012 - in the same year that it completed 200 years as Finland’s capital . 
I am delighted to be here in this historic building , the seat of the City ' s highest decision making body . 
I have noted , with great interest , that the Helsinki City Council has a long history , having held its first meeting as far back as 1875 . 
In giving me this honour , you are honouring the people of India . 
Your Excellency , local self government is an area where India and Finland have much in common . 
Throughout its ancient history , going back four to five thousand years , India has had a tradition of local self - government . 
Villages and cities in India have had elected local bodies to attend to administrative responsibilities and deliver justice . 
Our Constitution provides for local self governance – and the ‘Panchayati Raj’ system , as we call it today , has established itself as a successfully functioning basic unit of administration and development . 
Ladies and Gentlemen of the City Council , as I address the people of Helsinki through you , I would like to underline the value that India attaches to her friendship with Finland . 
Although our peoples are separated by oceans and continents , they have successfully forged links through their shared values . 
We are both open societies , we have a shared commitment to democracy , individual freedoms , the Rule of Law and upholding of human rights . 
We firmly believe in the principle of harmonious co - existence of peoples in peace and with mutual respect . 
Our common interests in the field of science and technology , our complementarities in the fields of information technology and engineering , our fruitful collaboration in biotechnology and the joint projects that we have taken up in polar research , oil exploration and clean and renewable energy have brought our peoples closer together in a mutually beneficial way . 
In recent years , our bilateral cooperation has become increasingly multi - faceted and dynamic . 
We have begun to match our economic complementarities and our scientists have successfully partnered to achieve very interesting outcomes - whether in the field of bio - diagnostics or third generation bio - fuels or simple innovations that can be commercially developed by small and medium enterprises in India and Finland alike . 
We , in India , welcome entrepreneurs from Finland who have set up base and are working in India . 
We value their contribution in developing environment - friendly technologies . 
This in fact is one of the priorities of our Government and the success of Indo - Finnish collaborations in this field is certainly very promising . 
India is an old civilisation with a ‘young’ population : 65 % of our population is presently below 35 years of age . Upgrading their skills for their effective participation in nation building is a high priority for the Government of India . 
We look forward to co - operating with Finland in the skills development sector . During this visit , a number of agreements and MoUs are being signed . 
These will link premier academic and scientific institutions in India and Finland in noteworthy collaborations and promote joint work in many areas of shared interest . 
There is a lot that we can learn from the experiences , best practices and successful innovations of Finland ; our scientists and professionals , too , have much to bring to the table . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , we have much to look forward to in our bilateral partnership . 
It is evident that the geographical distance from India and the cold weather here have not deterred young professionals from India from living and working amongst you . 
I thank the people of Finland for making them feel welcome and comfortable . 
With these words , I would like to extend to you and through you , to the friendly people of Helsinki , the warm greetings of the people of India for your continued progress and prosperity . 
Madame Chairperson and Distinguished Office bearers of the City Council , I take this opportunity to invite you to visit India . 
I once again thank you for presenting me the Medal of Honour of this great city and wish you every success in your endeavours for the citizens of Helsinki . 
I invite you to raise a toast : 
·To the health , happiness and success of our hosts , Their Excellencies , the Chairperson , the Mayor and the Distinguished Members of the Helsinki City Council , 
·The success of the people of this historic City , 
·The continued progress and prosperity of the people of Finland , and
·The enduring friendship between India and Finland . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PLENARY SESSION OF THE JOINT SEMINAR ON BUSINESS , SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HELD AT CONFEDERATION OF NORWEGIAN ENTERPRISE
It is indeed a privilege to address this distinguished gathering of business participants , academicians and scientists from both countries . 
All of you play a vital role in making the relationship between our countries stronger and more robust . 
India and Norway have had traditionally warm and friendly relations based on our shared commitment to multi - party democracy , open societies , rule of law , a vibrant press and an independent judicial system . 
Our positions converge on many regional and global issues . 
Economic and commercial relations obtain between us in a wide variety of sectors like shipping and maritime , oil and gas , information technology , textiles , minerals , commodities and machinery . 
The total trade between our economies stood at nearly one billion US Dollars in 2013 - 14 which , I must say , is not a true reflection of the relative size of our economies and , indeed , of the potential for economic and commercial exchanges that exists . 
I hope for an early conclusion of the on - going negotiations for a Trade and Investment Agreement between India and the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) , of which Norway is one of the four member nations . 
I am accompanied on this visit by a business delegation comprising captains of industry from sectors like financial services , ports , defence , seafood , oil and gas , energy , healthcare , hydro - power , information technology , manufacturing and pharmaceuticals . 
I am certain that they will connect with their Norwegian counterparts to usher mutually beneficial business partnerships . 
India is the third largest economy in the world in terms of purchasing power parity . 
In the last decade from 2004 - 05 to 2013 - 14 , our economy grew at an average rate of 7 . 6 per cent per year . 
Due to the continuing global economic slowdown and other factors , our GDP growth rate was subdued at below five per cent during the last two years . 
I am , however , happy to share that the green shoots of recovery are clearly visible . 
In the first quarter of the current financial year , the Indian economy achieved a growth rate of 5 . 7 per cent . 
Our external sector has already strengthened with our current account deficit declining sharply from 4 . 7 per cent of GDP in 2012 - 13 to 1 . 7 per cent in 2013 - 14 . 
Steps taken towards fiscal consolidation like deregulation of diesel prices have shown positive results . 
A progressive reduction of our fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 2016 - 17 now seems eminently achievable . 
Inflation has decelerated over the past three years and we hope to contain it below 5 % through a judicious mix of policy measures . 
Our agriculture sector is performing well . 
India now ranks second in the world in both wheat and rice production . 
A record food grains production of 264 . 8 million tonnes last year helped the agriculture sector grow at a healthy 4 . 7 per cent in 2013 - 14 . 
A number of measures aimed at investment revival , strengthening of macro - economic stability and ramping up infrastructure will certainly posit India back into the high growth trajectory of 7 - 8 per cent . 
India continues to be one of the most preferred destinations for foreign direct investment with FDI inflows into India peaking at 46 . 6 billion US Dollars in 2011 - 12 . 
I am confident that with the revival of global business sentiment we will be able to attract substantial FDI inflows . 
India has a growing and aspirational middle class , an increasing per capita income and a young working population all of which present a great opportunity and are of interest to foreign investors . 
To further facilitate FDI , we have recently enhanced FDI limits in sectors like insurance and defence manufacturing and allowed 100 per cent FDI in railway infrastructure . 
This will further strengthen our position as a credible destination for overseas investors . 
I may , however , point out that of the total FDI equity inflows into India of 228 billion US Dollars since April 2000 , FDI from Norway has only been 164 million US Dollars which belies the vast potential that exists in our economic relationship . 
I am confident Norwegian industry will make full use of the new investment opportunities that now present themselves in India . 
The coming together of India’s large talent pool and technological and financial investments from Norway can well catapult our economic relationship to a new high . 
Overall Norwegian investments , including investments in the capital market , in India have doubled from 4 billion US Dollars in 2012 to approximately 8 billion US Dollars in 2013 . 
This is indicative of the promise that Norwegian investors , particularly portfolio investors , see in the growing Indian market . 
In this context , I would like to make a special mention of the Government Pension Fund – Global of Norway , which is the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world with assets close to 900 billion US Dollars . 
Investments of the Fund in equity and fixed income assets in India are only about 4 billion US Dollars . 
Given India’s tremendous growth potential , I am hopeful that the Fund will considerably increase its investment exposure to our economy . 
We have renewed our thrust on the manufacturing sector in India . 
In 2011 we unveiled a policy that envisaged increasing the contribution of manufacturing to our GDP from 15 percent presently to 25 percent by 2022 . 
We remain committed to pursuing our objective of making India a manufacturing hub . 
We are well on course to becoming a manufacturing base and an export hub for diverse goods ranging from agricultural products to automobile components to high - end services . 
Many of our industrial sectors today are globally competitive and internationally acclaimed for their quality . 
The Indian government is committed to a business - friendly environment – impediment free , predictable , facilitatory and transparent . 
To that end , India has embarked on an ambitious ‘Make in India’ program to make the country an investor - friendly destination by setting up single window clearances , e - Business portals and Investor Facilitation Cells . 
I am confident that Norwegian investors shall take optimum advantage of the new policies unveiled . 
The infrastructure sector is a focus area for our economy . 
In the next few years , we envisage a spend of a trillion US Dollars on infrastructure , including on new power projects , which offer a great opportunity for energy companies in Norway . 
Your country is a repository of advanced technology in hydro - electric power and there is tremendous scope for cooperation in this area between our two governments . 
India needs to augment her power generation capacity to meet the ever - expanding energy needs of our growing economy . 
I am confident that both our countries can work together in this sector for mutual benefit . 
India also holds immense promise for Norwegian companies seeking to invest in sectors such as oil and gas , shipping , machinery and clean technologies . 
To facilitate greater investment in infrastructure , we have set up facilities and schemes such asIndustrial Corridors , the Industrial Infrastructure Up - gradation Scheme , National Investment and Manufacturing Zones , Industrial clusters and Smart Cities . 
Development of infrastructure will not only propel economic growth in our country but shall also enable foreign companies that invest in India to participate in and partake the benefits of our growth . 
I am pleased to inform you that Norway will feature in the list of few countries to be soon granted the facility of Tourist Visa on Arrival which will greatly facilitate travel for Norwegian citizens to India . 
The Joint Working Groups between our two countries in areas such as Environment , Science & Technology , Higher Education , Hydrocarbons , Culture , Local Governance and Maritime mattershave the potential of transforming our bilateral relationship . 
The Statement of Intent on Research in the Defence Sector being formalized today further underscores the depth of our engagement in a multitude of high technology areas and our shared strategic objectives . 
The Higher Education Sector in India is a priority and is expanding at a fast pace . 
Many new institutions of higher learning have either been established or are in the process of being set up . 
There is in India today immense emphasis on fundamental research in science and technology . 
We hope this will help us manage better , issues such as climate change , food and drinking water security and sustainable , clean energy sources . 
Collaborations between India and Norway in science and technology and research and innovation need to intensify and focus on these high priority areas . 
We also need to create an ecosystem that shall facilitate exchange of students and faculty between our two countries and also nurture innovation and enterprise through joint courses and degrees . 
I have in my delegation eminent educationists from leading Indian institutions who shall no doubt carry forward these ideas in deliberations with their Norwegian counterparts in the roundtables that shall follow . 
I am extremely happy to note that India and Norway are signing several MoUs and Agreements designed to further collaboration between our Governments in areas such as diplomatic visa waivers ; research & development ; joint knowledge sharing programmes ; exchange of faculty , scientists and research scholars ; and exchange of research materials and information . 
Apart from the governmental agreements , it is heartening to note that an agreement is also being signed between Fish Biotech Private Ltd . ( India ) and the Akva Group ASA to set up a joint venture fish farming project near Delhi . 
This project entails use of intensive ‘aquaponics’ in a controlled environment with state of the art Recirculation Aquaculture System ( RAS ) technology from Norway . 
I must congratulate Norway ' s Trade & Industry Minister , Ms . Monica Maeland , CII , NHO ( Confederation of Norwegian Enterprises ) and NICCI ( Norway India Chamber of Commerce ) who are working together in close cooperation with both governments to boost bilateral trade and investments . 
I am confident that the dedicated efforts of all stake holders shall redefine and re - invigorate the economic and trade relations between our two great nations . 
It is my pleasure to extend an invitation to Norwegian businesses to participate in the 2nd India - Central Europe Business Forum to be held in India in the first quarter of 2015 . 
I wish all of you - industry & business leaders , academics and scientists - from both our countries success in your future endeavours and Godspeed in your efforts . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE STATE BANQUET HOSTED BY HIS MAJESTY , THE KING OF NORWAY
It is indeed a privilege to be here on this first State Visit from India to Norway . 
I thank Your Majesty for your kind words . 
I deeply appreciate the warm welcome and the gracious hospitality accorded to me and to my delegation . 
At the outset , I would like to congratulate Your Majesty and the Government and people of Norway as you celebrate the bicentennial of your Constitution . 
I take this opportunity to applaud the active role that Norway has played in global efforts aimed at peace and development . 
Norway’s contribution to the recognition of exceptional human endeavour in all fields of activity , through the institution of the Nobel Peace Prize , is an outstanding example of the lead taken by you in advancement of human and civilisational values . 
Your Majesty , India attaches great importance to its long standing friendship with Norway . 
Though our two nations are geographically distant from each other , we are bound by our common commitment to democratic values and practice . 
We are both open , pluralistic societies that are committed to the protection of human rights and the Rule of Law . 
We have , over the years , developed mutual trust and goodwill that has brought our people together to achieve our common goals in many sectors . 
Our bilateral relations have never been better and we are both desirous of enhancing our co - operation to its full potential . 
We , in India , recognise and greatly value the contribution of Your Majesty and the other members of the Royal Family of Norway to the building and strengthening of our excellent relations . 
Your Majesty , our countries have similar views on many issues of regional and global concern . 
We have been co - operating closely in the United Nations and other multilateral fora - where India appreciates the support that we have received and continue to receive from Norway . 
We are grateful for your endorsement of India ' s rightful claim to Permanent Membership of the United Nations Security Council and for yourproactive efforts that helped India achieve Observer status in the Arctic Council . 
Our bilateral co - operation has been no less fruitful . 
We have a very rewarding partnership in oil exploration and scientific research and are both keen to expand the scope of our collaborative efforts in earth sciences , bio - technology , clean energy , fishing and healthcare . 
I would like to thank the Government of Norway for the assistance and support extended to India in establishing our Polar Research Station in Svalbard . 
Your Majesty , you have visited India about three decades ago . India has progressed and evolved in many ways since then . 
Yet there are many areas whereGovernment of India would like to see more development and inclusive growth . 
The new Government is taking a number of measures to encourage investments , revive the manufacturing sector in India , promote skill development , develop smart cities and engage closely with all interested partners and investors in India and abroad to make this happen . 
Business sentiments are positive and strong . 
While trade between India and Norway has been expanding , it is clear that there is significant potential waiting to be realised . 
Government of Indiainvites investors and entrepreneurs from Norway to explore possibilities of investment in India’s infrastructure sector . 
We welcome foreign directinvestments in our railways , roads and ports , power and communications sectors ; we invite Norwegian companiesto join Indian counterparts in the " Make in India” initiative of the new Government and we are presently simplifying the procedures to facilitate their participation in India’s growth story . 
We welcome the ‘India Strategy’ launched in 2009 by Norway and we look forward to new partnerships and collaborations in areas of our common interest . 
I am confident that the bilateral agreements that we have signed will lead to further fruitful engagement in the many fields where India and Norway have obvious complementarities . 
With these words , Your Majesties , I thank you once again for your gracious hospitality and invite you to visit India at a time of your convenience . 
It would be an honour and privilege to receive you in New Delhi . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , I request you to please join me in raising a toast : 
·To the health of Their Majesties , the King and Queen of the Kingdom of Norway
·To the continued progress and prosperity of the people of Norway and
·To the enduring friendly relations between India and Norway . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE 11TH METROPOLIS WORLD CONGRESS 2014
I am honoured to attend the closing ceremony of the 11th Metropolis World Congress 2014 being organized in Hyderabad by the Government of Telangana . 
I believe this is the first major international conference in the newly formed state . 
I understand the " Metropolis World Congress” meets triennially and brings the best urban leaders , administrators , city managers , practitioners , organizations and citizen representatives from 136 metropolitan cities on one platform to discuss current issues of their cities and share knowledge . 
This is the first time this Congress is being held in India and representatives of over 100 Indian cities are also present here today . 
I am sure the intellectual churning over the last three days has been fruitful and will provide new insight into urban planning and administration with the ultimate goal of making ‘Cities for all’ which is the theme of the Congress . 
I congratulate Government of Telangana and Metropolis on successfully hosting this event . 
Urbanisation is sweeping the world . 
It has been said that the 19th century was the century of empires ; the 20th century was the century of countries and the 21st century will be the century of cities . 
During 2008 , according to the United Nations , mankind became for the first time in its history a predominantly urban species . 
Demographers estimate that three quarters ( 75 % ) of the global population could be urban by 2050 with most of the increase coming in the fast growing towns of Asia and Africa . 
According to India’s census of 2011 , about 377 million Indians comprising 31 % of the country’s population , live in urban areas in comparison to 45 % in China , 54 % in Indonesia , 78 % in Mexico and 87 % in Brazil . 
Urban population recorded an annual growth rate of 2 . 76 per cent and the 2011 Census reported a dramatic increase in the number of million plus cities from 35 to 52 . 
Urban areas are now acknowledged as " engines of economic growth” and more than 60 % of India’s Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) emanates from urban areas . 
The top 100 largest cities produce about 43 % of the GDP , with 16 % of the population and just 0 . 24 % of the land area . Globally it is also being recognized that rather than a ‘rural - urban dichotomy’ , the phenomenon of ‘rural - urban continuum’ is the order of the day . 
In India too , there is realization that planned urbanization is one of the keys to unlock India’s growth potential . 
At a time when more than fifty percent of the world live in urban areas , it is important that administrators address the ever rising challenges of sanitation , pollution , mobility , civic amenities and public safety in an innovative manner . 
Most cities from the developing world are unprepared , both at local and global levels , to face the challenge of urbanization and ensuring equity in the provision of basic infrastructure and amenities . 
There is urgent need to strengthen urban governance and local finances in order to meet current demands and the challenges ahead of us . 
These challenges are not only in the context of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions but also with regard to provision of basic services to all the inhabitants , development of networks for water supply and transport , collection of waste , provision of equitable access to land and energy , building of green buildings , expansion of mass transportation systems etc . 
Also , our cities are having to do more with less and less financial resources . 
Urban India today faces a backlog in the provision of basic amenities and infrastructure . 
About 9 percent of urban India does not have access to safe drinking water and 12 . 6 % per cent have no toilet facilities . 
The first challenge for any urban administrator is sanitation . 
A clean city is the first and foremost parameter of equity . 
A clean environment is the right of every citizen . 
Urban administrators must treat cleanliness as a non - negotiable requirement . 
They must make a paradigm shift from waste dumping to waste processing . 
Garbage must be seen as a resource . 
A city which only dumps waste but not processes is not a smart city . 
I am happy to learn that the city of Hyderabad has taken right steps in this regard . 
As many of you would be aware , the Government of India has launched a massive campaign called the " Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan” . 
This five year Clean India Mission seeks to provide sanitation facilities for all and create a clean urban India in the 4041 statutory towns by 2019 , the 150th anniversary of the birth of the father of our nation , Mahatma Gandhi . 
Pollution is another huge challenge in cities today . 
The focus must be on prevention rather than mitigation of pollutants . 
Apart from creating lung spaces and green cover , we must encourage people to adopt energy efficient technologies . 
Green buildings and green zones must be an integral and imperative part of urban planning and citizens must be encouraged to plan their new dwellings accordingly . 
Unless we include greenery and conservation in the policy making and planning stage itself , the green deficit will always remain huge and impossible to fulfill . 
With an ever increasing population in cities , the need for comprehensive traffic management cannot be over emphasized . 
Efficient and affordable urban mobility solutions are a critical component of a smart city . 
Traditionally municipalities in India have not treated urban transport as their core function . 
But there is new realization that a city should think and act about how its people move from one point to another . 
Mobility and transport are a development issue and not just a regulatory issue . 
Cities must encourage their populations to use public systems as their first choice . 
The Hyderabad Metro is among the best models of public transport available in India . 
I hope it will set an example for similar efforts worldwide . 
Urban administrators must use technology to provide better amenities to our people . 
Since cities are growth engines and time is money , people should not have to waste productive time in accessing basic amenities
Government to citizen services should be available online with minimal human interface . 
In the past decade , India has taken many novel steps in this direction . 
As people increasingly depend on the internet for getting their services , entire cities will need to be wi - fi enabled . 
As migration into cities grow , housing for all becomes a critical issue . 
It is imperative for city administrators to evolve sustainable housing policies which will prevent the creation of new slums . 
Private partnership should be made an integral part of such policies . 
Creation of satellite townships is another way of addressing this issue . 
Several state governments have adopted innovative approaches in creating housing for the poor and there is need for cross - learning from each other . 
Safety is a major concern for city Governments across the world and a sine - qua - non of smart cities . 
As urban populations rise , public safety is bound to become a major concern . 
City administrators have to leverage new technology to ensure maximum public safety . 
A city is as safe as its people want it to be . 
Public support and participation is critical for effective administration of law and order . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , the Government of India proposes to launch a new Urban Development Mission to support states by handholding them in building infrastructure and services in step with the rapid pace of urbanization . 
A new mission mode program is being designed to take up these activities for 500 cities of the Nation . 
Private sector participation by way of PPP ( Public Private Partnerships ) methodology will be encouraged . 
The Government’s focus will also be to support capacity building programs for our elected as well as officials working in Urban Sector . 
Another initiative of the Government is to develop 100 Smart cities . 
The smart city approach will merge urban Planning , governance , ecology , environment , infrastructure and information technology to ensure that benefits of technology reach every neighbourhood and improves the quality of lives of citizens . 
Finally , the Government proposes to launch HRIDAY or Heritage City Development & Augmentation Yojna . 
Under this programme sustainable development of heritage centres will be taken up bringing together urban planning , economic growth and heritage conservation in an inclusive and integrated manner with focus on livelihoods , skills , cleanliness , security , accessibility and service delivery . 
Conferences like Metropolis provides the perfect platform for sharing ideas from different parts of the globe . 
Our ancient scripture , Rig Veda states ‘Aano bhadra kratavo yantu vishwatah’ which means ‘let noble thoughts come from all directions’ . 
I am sure that noble thoughts have flowed in from all directions during this conference . 
I hope these thoughts will result in speedy action and better cities in the near future . 
I thank all the distinguished dignitaries , experts and delegates from abroad for visiting India and wish them a safe journey back to their homes . 
I congratulate Metropolis and the Government of Telengana , especially Chief Minister K . Chandrasekhar Rao and his officers once again for having made this Congress a grand success . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE GOLDEN JUBILEE CELEBRATIONS OF JAWAHARLAL INSTITUTE OF POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
It is a happy occasion for me to be here this afternoon for the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research ( JIPMER ) , which is one of the top medical institutes of our country . 
I thank you for inviting me to be a part of this historic event . 
I am glad to use this occasion to visit Puducherry again , after a year . 
It is a fascinating city with beautiful boulevards and placid promenades . 
This place is associated with Sri Aurobindo , who established an Ashram that has followers from around the world . 
Puducherry is also linked to revered Tamil poets : Bharathidasan , who was born here ; and Subramania Bharathiar , who chose this place to write some of his memorable poems . 
On this significant occasion of Golden Jubilee of JIPMER , I compliment the entire fraternity of this Institute . 
I am told that as part of the year - long celebrations , JIPMER has conducted national and international conferences and workshops . 
Held a marathon to focus on eradication of tuberculosis ; and launched initiatives like the Emergency Disaster Management Centre . 
It also has plans to hold medical camps and exhibitions , and community interaction programmes . 
I wish you a smooth completion of these activities . 
Though JIPMER is fifty years old , the origin of this institution can be traced back to 1823 when a medical college called École de Médicine de Pondichérry was established by the French Government . 
After the transfer of Pondicherry to India , the Government of India took over the college and named it Medical College Pondicherry . 
It was thereafter called Dhanvantari Medical College for a short period . 
Upon its up - gradation to a regional post - graduate institute , it was re - named JIPMER in 1964 . 
It became an Institution of National Importance in 2008 . 
JIPMER has made rapid progress in recent years . 
With over 40 academic departments , including over 20 post - graduate courses and 8 super - specialty programmes , this medical school caters to a wide spectrum of medical education . 
The establishment of crucial facilities - a 360 - bed Super - Specialty Block , a hundred - bed Emergency Medical Service and Trauma Care Centre , a 76 - bed Regional Cancer Centre , and a 400 - bed Women and Children Hospital - has rendered this premier Institution a privileged responsibility in the sphere of healthcare . 
Its persistent drive to expand is noteworthy and I congratulate all those associated with these endeavours . 
Good health is mankind’s foremost possession . Without it , one suffers from incapacity in accessing good education , in seeking employment opportunities , and in leading a decent life . 
Lord Buddha had said and I quote : " Health is the greatest gift , contentment the greatest wealth… . ”
In India , we have the largest young population in the world , with over fifty per cent of our population below 25 years of age . 
By 2020 , the average age of an Indian will be 29 years , as compared to 37 years for a Chinese or an American . 
The proportion of working age population is likely to be 64 per cent by 2021 . 
This demographic dividend is for our taking , provided we have a healthy and educated population . 
A holistic healthcare system - universally accessible , affordable and effective – is the need of the hour . 
It calls for a strong healthcare infrastructure , trained and motivated personnel , and access to medicines and modern equipments . 
There are 7 hospital beds per 10 , 000 population in India , compared to 23 in Brazil , 38 in China and 97 in Russia . 
There are 7 physicians per 10 , 000 population in India , compared to 19 in Brazil , 15 in China and 43 in Russia . 
Though schemes like the National Rural Health Mission have improved service delivery in India , health services are still constrained by its reach and quality . 
Primary healthcare is critical as it reduces the need for tertiary care . 
Public financing for healthcare in India is less than one percent of the world’s total health expenditure . 
As Indians are a sixth of humanity , this is woefully meager . 
Our expenditure levels have to rise significantly to ensure universal health coverage . 
‘Health for All’ is a maxim that needs to be put into practice immediately . 
Most developed nations of the world have proficient healthcare systems to take care of the medical needs of its population . 
We need to study these systems without blindly following them . 
Our country , due to its sheer size , population and diversity , has to follow a model that best suit our needs . 
The power of technology has to be utilized in a meaningful way in the health sector . 
The tele - medicine project , which uses satellite technology , connects remote health centres with super - specialty hospitals for expert consultation to reach the needy and under - served . 
India is a global leader in information technology . 
We should require no further prodding to put in place such innovative solutions to take care of the medical needs of our vast population . 
I am told that the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has embarked upon formulating a new health policy . 
Our immediate aim should be to eradicate communicable diseases and control the non - communicable ones . 
In my Address to the Joint Session of Parliament in June this year , I had announced that tertiary healthcare would receive renewed focus . 
I am happy to note that JIPMER will be the first amongst medical institutions where new Schools of Public Health are going to be set up . 
Some medical treatments are expensive . 
But , that should never translate into denial of cure to any , including the poor . In India , out - of - pocket expenditure comprises 86 percent of private expenditure on health . 
Due to lack of financial risk protection , many in our country plunge into poverty fighting ailments and bearing high costs of treatment . 
A strong health insurance mechanism is the key . As per a survey , over 300 million people in India are covered by health insurance . 
This number has been projected to rise to 630 million , or a half of the population , by 2015 . 
I hope that the National Health Assurance Mission , which has been envisaged , will help bring more and more people under the health security net . 
A holistic approach to healthcare is necessary . 
Due to the increasing trend of lifestyle - related diseases , precautionary strategies have become important . 
Prevention of medical conditions calls for proper counseling . 
Healthy living has to be fostered from a very young age . 
7 percent of the world’s children are obese or over - weight . 
Obesity in childhood can lead to health complications later . 
Balanced diet , physical activity and lifestyle management have to be promoted . 
Special interventions are necessary for newborns as the first four weeks of life , during which 44 per cent of deaths of children below five years occur , are crucial . 
Life - saving medicines and procedural expertise have to be available far and wide . 
Hygiene and sanitation also play an important role in preventing the occurrence or spread of diseases . 
I am hopeful that under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan , we would be able to cover every household by total sanitation in the next five years . 
Health research is a much - neglected area in our country . 
Research is essential for the development of medical interventions necessary to maintain good health by the people . 
Development ofsound systems of medicine requires translation of knowledge gained in other disciplines . 
It has been demonstrated how knowledge from aviation , automation and robotics can be used for optimizing healthcare . 
Medical research has to be , therefore , a culmination of multi - disciplinary effort comprising varied fields like medical electronics , systems biology , bio - technology , genomics , mathematical simulation and information and communication . 
JIPMER should aim to enrich its research - based publications , go for patent filings , and develop models addressing common health problems by integrating Indian Systems of Medicine . 
We need researchers , with talent and integrity , to work in our institutions . 
Researchers have to fully understand what innovative solutions are required in various branches of healthcare . 
At the same time , research findings have to be implemented on the ground rather than being confined to the academic sphere . 
It is , therefore , crucial to strike close collaborations between researchers and policymakers . 
To be counted as one of the developed nations in the world , we have to create a ‘healthy’ India . 
The latitude for discretion is less . We have to act now , and fast . 
JIPMER has a profound role to play in this endeavour . 
True to your mission , which is ‘to see the smile on the face of the poor’ , I am sure you all will be the ambassadors of change , and measure your success by the smiles you bring in the millions of our countrymen in the years to come . 
With these words , I conclude , I once again wish all of you the very best . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE BANQUET HOSTED IN HONOUR OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA , H . E . MR . XI JINPING
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you , Madame Peng Liyuan , and the distinguished members of your delegation to Rashtrapati Bhavan this evening . 
Your State Visit to India is taking place at a time when India and China are looking forward to a new era in our bilateral relations . 
Excellency , the people of India see China as a great civilization , a nation that has achieved unprecedented progress and prosperity in a remarkably short span of time . 
The spectacular success of the People’s Republic of China in economic development , poverty alleviation , infrastructure creation and information connectivity is , indeed , inspiring . 
As a neighbour , India would be happy to see China continue on its path of robust economic growth and productivity and further contribute to a stronger global economy and peace in the region and the world . 
It is India’s sincere belief that as our relationship evolves to a partnership that is balanced and broad - based , we will create significant opportunities for both our countries to take initiatives for mutual benefit in the bilateral context and also to accrue the benefits that we seek from the evolution and growth of Asia . 
In our discussions this evening , we agreed that there exists considerable potential for greater co - operation between India and China in the bilateral , regional and international spheres . 
The agreements for co - operation that our two Governments have signed today in a wide range of areas of common interest reflect the growing maturity in our ties . 
We are now focused on giving a fresh impetus to our joint efforts . 
We would like to realise the full potential of our many complementarities . 
At the same time , in order to create and sustain a positive environment for this to happen and endure , it is necessary for us to remain sensitive to each other’s concerns and aspirations . 
Excellency , enhancing our trade and economic co - operation is in our common interest . 
To achieve this , we can and must , re - double our efforts to address the trade deficit , provide better market access to each other’s goods and explore the opportunities to create co - operation in the infrastructure sector . 
Excellency , our nations share a desire for early resolution of the outstanding issues between our States - including the boundary question . 
We are both committed to the maintenance of peace and tranquility at our borders ; we both would like to ensure that the dialogue mechanisms that we have created for this purpose are error - proof . 
It is important for us to improve the dialogue and co - operative engagement between our two militaries and constantly strive to enhance the communication between them at all levels . 
It is clear that we are , today , at a defining stage in our bilateral relationship . 
We now need to take it to a level where our programmes and initiatives facilitate the realization of our common goals of progress and prosperity for our two nations . 
Both our countries are committed to working in that direction . 
I once again welcome Your Excellency and Madame Peng Liyuan and wish you a very enjoyable and fruitful visit to India . 
With these words , permit me , Excellency , to raise a toast to : 
- the enduring friendship between our two ancient civilizations ; 
- everlasting peace between our two societie
- deepening of the multifaceted relationship between our two Governments ; and
- the good health , happiness and prosperity of Your Excellency and Madame Peng Liyuan . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE BANQUET HOSTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM , H . E . MR . TRUONG TAN SANG
I am honoured to be here . 
I thank you for your generous words and the kind sentiments expressed by you – which I fully reciprocate . 
I was profoundly touched by the warmth of the reception accorded to me and to my delegation by the Government and the people of Vietnam . 
My visit to Vietnam provides me an opportunity to personally convey the deep commitment of the Government and the people of India to the enduring friendship and co - operation between our two great nations . 
Excellency , Vietnam is a country whose people India holds in the highest esteem . 
We have great admiration for the unconquerable spirit of the Vietnamese people , for their determination to succeed against all odds and their tenacity and fortitude against even the most powerful adversaries . 
Today , the same attributes and national character are driving your economic growth and development . 
These have resulted in increased prosperity and better living standards of your people . 
This progress is testimony to the inspirational leadership of this country and the perseverance of its people . 
Excellency , our two countries have been closely linked , over the centuries , by the mutually beneficial trade and peaceful contacts . 
Of these , the most enduring bond that we share is our common heritage of Buddhism . 
Even today , the teachings and principles of Lord Buddha are valid and relevant and are embraced by both our societies in our daily life and interactions . 
We also share a history of our struggle for independence from colonial rule . 
In 1942 , the legendary Ho Chi Minh , from his prison cell , had written to Pandit Nehru , who was then also in jail , saying that even though they had not met and were separated by a thousand miles , yet they were communicating " without words” . Sure enough , Pandit Nehru gave Ho Chi Minh his solidarity and support . 
He was the first foreign leader to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam after the liberation of Hanoi . 
Significantly , it was during Pandit Nehru’s visit that Ho Chi Minh made his first public appearance after returning to a free Hanoi . 
The enthusiastic public welcome given to Ho Chi Minh on his visit to Delhi in 1958 and Dr . Rajendra Prasad when he visited Vietnam in 1959 reflected the great empathy and friendship between our two peoples . 
I invoke the close bonds of these Founding Fathers of our nations as it is their vision and foresight that recognised the great potential of our closeness . Successive generations of our leaders have nurtured and consolidated it . 
Its warmth endures , and I can feel it in the hospitality extended to me today . 
Excellency , our nations have now made a transition from the era of post colonial solidarity and entered a new phase of strategic engagement as natural partners . 
Our relations have never been better than they are today . 
Our Strategic Partnership has blossomed into a robust , mutually rewarding , multi - faceted relationship . 
Our co - operation at regional and multilateral fora constitutes one of the strong pillars of this Strategic Partnership . 
It has been reinforced by regular exchanges at the highest political level and the institutional mechanisms that we have created . 
Today , as we emerge as two of the fastest growing economies in the world , the potential of our joint efforts to enhance our bilateral trade and investment , our collaboration in science and technology , our co - operation in human resource development and , of course , our cultural exchanges , is infinite . 
We also have a convergence of views on most regional and international issues . 
We are convinced that together we can promote peace , stability and security in this region and the world . 
As two developing countries with a stake in the future , we can and should take advantage of our many synergies . 
I am confident that our dialogue and partnership will only strengthen in the years to come . 
The future presents us with innumerable new opportunities - and , inevitably , some challenges . 
In order for us to safeguard our national interests and further our shared goals of peace and prosperity , India and Vietnam must stand together . 
India will always remain your reliable and all - weather friend . 
Please join me in a toast : 
- To the good health , happiness and success of His Excellency , Troung Tan Sang , President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and all of you present here today ; 
- To the peace , prosperity and progress of the brave and friendly people of Vietnam and ; 
- To the everlasting bonds of friendship between India and Vietnam . 
REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF INDIA STUDY CENTRE IN HO CHI MINH NATIONAL ACADEMY FOR POLITICS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
I am delighted to join you in inaugurating the India Study Centre . 
Both our Governments have an abiding commitment to our people - to - people ties . 
The establishment of this Study Centre is yet another example of this . 
Strong civilisational bonds exist between India and Vietnam since the 2nd century A . D . 
These have , today , evolved into a vibrant and multi - dimensional Strategic Partnership . 
Our current dialogue is based on the close understanding and friendship of the founding fathers of our two great nations . 
India and Vietnam have had similar experiences in shaping our national identities – our struggle for freedom from colonial rule , our thirst for development and the realization of the aspirations of our people . 
Today , our bilateral dialogue is frank and our co - operation in areas of common interest has grown from strength to strength . 
We are engaged in joint initiatives and programmes across a wide range of areas of common interest . 
In 2012 , we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations . 
We have no irritants between us . 
President Ho Chi Minh had likened the India - Vietnam relationship to a " cloudless sky” . 
Our shared perceptions are shaped by the teachings of the Lord Buddha . 
These have inculcated in us a deep respect for peace and the harmonious co - existence of all living beings . 
On most regional and global issues , we have a convergence of views . 
Our Governments collaborate closely in the United Nations , World Trade Organisation and many regional and multilateral fora . 
Both our peoples are determined to create a society that is peaceful , prosperous and stable . 
With the changing dynamics in the Asia - Pacific , there has been a shift of economic and strategic gravity towards Asia . We see a growing role and relevance for our partnership in this context . 
Excellency , we , in India , consider Vietnam as a trusted friend and an important pillar of India’s " Look East Policy” . 
In our co - operation in the area of defence and security , we are committed to the promotion of peace in our region . 
Vietnam is also one of India’s most important economic partners . 
Our bilateral trade has increased significantly - by 31 % - to USD 8 billion in the year 2013 - 2014 , surpassing the target that we had jointly set for ourselves . 
Excellency , I would emphasise the importance of further strengthening our economic linkages . 
The potential of our complementarities is tremendous . 
There are new opportunities in trade and investment . 
There are also significant prospects for building regional supply chains . 
We can and must encourage joint ventures between our investors - in India and Vietnam and also in third countries . 
These , in turn , will undoubtedly promote growth , employment and efficiencies in both our economies . 
Both our Governments have accorded the fullest encouragement , over the years , to strengthening the linkages between our peoples . 
Our investors and businessmen , professionals and researchers , technocrats and academicians as well as our Parliamentarians and our youth have successfully been working together . 
Our bilateral dialogue seeks to achieve higher levels of their collaboration for our mutual benefit . 
We have also prioritised the enhancement of the connectivity between us – and here I refer to the physical , institutional and people to people linkages . 
I am delighted that direct flights between India and Vietnam are being started later this year and I hope that it will soon be possible to also drive from Hanoi to Kolkata . 
The Archaeological Survey of India will be taking up a project for restoration and conservation of the Cham monuments at My Son . 
We look forward to opening an Indian cultural centre in Hanoi which will , no doubt , bring different aspects of Indian culture to your beautiful country . 
Both of us would like to see an intensification of the exchanges between our universities and institutions . 
I am delighted to note that the Ho Chi Minh National Academy for Politics and Public Administration has already evolved a co - operation framework with the prestigious Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore and with the Indian Institute of Public Administration in Delhi . 
We must do what we can to stimulate the curiosity of our younger generation in each other . 
We must encourage them to connect in a mutually beneficial relationship to sustain the brotherly sentiment that has bonded our societies for generations . 
I have no doubt that this Centre will grow into a focal point for academic exchanges that will enrich the bilateral discourse between our peoples . 
Excellency , with these words , I thank you for your support to the Centre . 
I would like to extend my thanks to the Ho Chi Minh National Academy for Politics and Public Administration for taking this initiative and offer my best wishes for the success of the India Study Centre . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE FDI ANNUAL WORLD DENTAL CONGRESS
I am indeed happy to be amidst this august gathering of distinguished dental professionals from over 138 countries , dental industry leaders , academicians and research scholars . 
At the outset , I would like to compliment the FDI World Dental Federation and Indian Dental Association for hosting this prestigious Annual World Dental Congress in India with the theme " a billion smiles welcome the world of dentistry” . 
Smile is a universal language , and I am glad to see that you all , who play a vital role in bringing real smiles on the face of billions of people , have come together to deliberate on the critical and emerging issues in the field of oral healthcare and dentistry . 
Oral health is integral to overall health and globally it is a challenging issue . 
Oral diseases are becoming the leading health problems and attributed mainly to rapidly changing lifestyles , wide - spread use of tobacco and increased consumption of alcohol . 
Due to prevalence and incidence , oral diseases pose a major threat to public health . 
I compliment FDI for pursuing with the United Nations for recognition of oral diseases as a part of non - communicable diseases such as diabetes , cardiovascular diseases , stroke , chronic respiratory diseases and cancer , on account of their sharing certain common risk factors . 
The initiatives of World Health Organization for a public consultation on sugars intake to reduce public health problems like obesity and dental caries , will also create a platform for overall oral healthcare management . 
The standards of oral and dental health is challenging in this subcontinent . 
Most people are ignorant of the significance of oral health and its impact on general health . 
Oral diseases and tooth decay were considered a part of the ageing process and ignored by a large number of people . 
I understand that IDA , as the custodian of oral health in the country , has launched several programmes and projects to raise awareness of the need for maintaining oral health and hygiene amongst different segments of the society . 
What we need today in India is an Oral Health Revolution similar to the Green Revolution and White Revolution . 
I am happy to note that IDA has been in the forefront of this campaign to bring about an Oral Health Revolution in the country along with FDI and its partners . 
Dental caries affect 60 - 80 % of our children and periodontal ( gum ) disease affect nearly 90 - 95 % of our population . 
I am glad that consistent with the global perspectives on Dental Caries , IDA has started a Child Dental Centre with the singular aim of preventing dental decay among children . 
The National Oral Health Programme of IDAthat combines preventive measures with emphasis on education to create oral health awareness among the various segments of the population is a laudable initiative . 
Globally , oral cancer is one of the major health challenges of the 21st century and India is also facing the major challenge of treatment and prevention of this disease . 
Tobacco use is one of the major causes of oral cancer . 
Dentists often are the first to detect any pre - cancerous lesions in the mouth . 
I am informed that IDA has set up an Oral Cancer Foundation for early detection and treatment of oral cancer along with Tobacco Intervention Initiative for tobacco cessation . 
I understand that an Oral Cancer Registry has also been set up to register exclusively oral cancer cases . 
The initiatives taken by the IDA gives us the confidence thatthetools devised for early detection of oral cancer and tobacco cessation will make significant contributions to oral healthcare management in the country . 
I am told that FDI’s global programme titled LIVE . LEARN . LAUGH of twice brushing with fluoride toothpaste implemented by IDA in selected districts in India has reported significant beneficial impact on oral health of school children . 
There is a need to sensitize school children about the basic needs of oral healthcare with an emphasis on general health . Regular dental check - up camps at schools , which IDA has been organizing , will spread awareness of oral health and hygiene . 
IDA must work out with the school authorities to reach the maximum number of schools for preventive oral healthcare amongst the school children . 
Dentistry today has attained new levels of excellence . We are witnessing revolutionary changes in dental technology . 
The usage of information technology and digitalisation of patient records have given a new dimension to the oral healthcare . 
Latest technologies have significantly improved diagnostic quality , patient comfort and efficiency in dental care . 
Healthcare is under digital transformation and it is redefining virtually every aspect of clinical practice and related business activity . 
The consistent breakthroughs in the field of dental science have had their impact on the professional dentists contributing to enhanced quality of treatment . 
Advances in dental research are making dentistry a technology - driven discipline . 
In this dynamic world , one needs to update oneself by embracing such evolving technologies which will have extensive use in clinical practices . 
This congress will equip the participants about the latest technologies and best practices . 
Evidence based and minimally invasive dentistry is in focus nowadays . 
In bridging the gap between research and dental practice , evidence based dentistryprovides a single source of ground breaking issues in dentistry . 
In line with the advancements in dental technology , the spectrum of dental diseases has also been undergoing a change owing to the sedentary lifestyle in vogue today . 
The growing awareness about diseases among the patients and their expectations bring a challenge before the professional capabilities of healthcare service providers . 
To meet these expectations , you need to devise methodology to deliver comfortable and affordable dental care to the community and adopt innovative procedures and technology . 
India’s biggest strength in the coming years is going to be her demographic dividend . 
More than fifty percent of our population is under 25 and soon one fifth of the world’s working population will be in India . 
We have set the target of skilling 500 million people by 2022 . 
IDA must work out that how the demographic dividend can be utilized by skilling more number of people in the oral healthcare sector with a twin purpose of generating the employment as well as creating access of quality oral healthcare to over 1 . 2 billion population of this country . 
India , with her population base , offers a great opportunity for business in the area of oral healthcare . 
Providing quality and affordable healthcare to the population is a formidable task . 
Government over the years has increased the allocation for health sector . 
The central government outlay for the health sector in the Twelfth Plan has been increased by 200 % to Rs . 300 , 018 crore over the actual outlay of Rs . 99 , 491 crore in the Eleventh Plan . 
The process of rolling out universal health coverage has also been set in motion . 
This emphasis offers a huge business opportunity in India . 
I am sure , the mini global dental market on display here , will be of mutual benefit to exhibitor and the relevant stakeholders in India . 
We all know that prevention is better than cure . 
We need to develop a holistic model to address the preventive needs as well as the disease specific requirements . 
I am hopeful that the deliberations in this Congress by the mighty minds from across the globe will bring out a model for oral healthcare , which can meet the demands of the individuals and make the oral healthcare truly affordable and accessible . 
Sharing of information and knowledge , exchange of expertise and experience are the hallmark of successful dental practice . 
This Congress provides such a global platform and I am sure you will utilize this opportunity to deliberate on the emerging issues of oral healthcare . 
I will eagerly look forward to the recommendations of this Congress . 
I wish the Annual World Dental Congress a success and wish all the delegates a pleasant and memorable stay in India . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF CALL ON BY STUDENTS FROM KING’S COLLEGE , LONDON & UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH , SCOTLAND
I am indeed happy to be amidst you this evening to meet students and faculty members from King’s College , London and University of Edinburgh , Scotland . India and United Kingdom share a long tradition and history as well as a multifaceted relationship . 
Your presence here this evening is an important manifestation of the good will and trust which both countries enjoy . 
I appreciate the efforts of the UGC and Delhi University to organise a ten day short term course on ‘DISABILITY AND INCLUSION : PERCEPTIONS & ISSUES IN CONTEMPORARY INDIA’ , under the Connect to India programme . 
This short term course , I am told is designed keeping in view the concept of inclusion and the needs and support systems for persons with disabilities . 
Iam sure that such linkages would result in an enhanced mutual understanding regarding the challenges and issues in the new millennium . 
I am told that students of King’s College , London and University of Edinburgh , Scotland attending the present course belong to diverse disciplines of study . 
Coming together of students from various academic interests and backgrounds for this purpose that too in a country different from their own , points to the global appeal of India’s fresh educational endeavours . 
Recognizing that the marginalized sections of our society , particularly persons with disabilities are an important resource towards the overall development of our country , India has taken up a number of measures to empower persons belonging to such segments , particularly , persons with disabilities . 
Our Constitution recognizes , among others , equality , education and life as being fundamental rights of every citizen of India . 
To ensure social inclusion in the real sense of the term , a two - pronged strategy has been adopted . 
While on one hand , special measures have been taken to move towards an equitable social order , on the other , we have taken a lead in implementing various international declarations and treaties both in letter and spirit . 
To further strengthen the provisions of ‘The Persons With Disabilities ( Equal Opportunities , Protection of Rights and Full Participation ) Act 1995’ , a National Policy document was also adopted in 2006 . 
This outlines specific steps to be taken to ensure full inclusion of persons with disabilities in education , employment and society as well as ways to ensure accessibility through technology and other enabling provisions . 
India is also a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to other important international treaties such as the recently concluded Marrakesh treaty aimed towards enhancing access to print materials for the visually impaired . 
Thus , while on one hand , India is committed towards economic development keeping in view the emerging global challenges and requirements , we are equally committed to ensure that the fruits of our development and growth reach all sections of society . 
I do hope that during your visit to India , you have had opportunities of learning and experiencing first hand the roadmap of development based on inclusion which India has been following and is committed to traverse . 
We do realise the significance of an inclusive society for all and are working towards equity and equality in all spheres . 
Towards this end , appropriate application of various technologies can prove to be very effective . 
Realizing this , India is rapidly moving towards the broadening of her educational reach and social empowerment by using advance technologies . 
Attempts are underway to make the concept of e - classroom a reality in every school of the country . 
The call of the world today is more towards putting innovative ideas into effective usage so that all can benefit from those ideas . 
We must use education and technology as a means to ensure inclusion and equality for all citizens . 
Countries which have strengthened their knowledge and educational systems , have achieved much higher levels of development . 
Social awareness and sensitization programmes , data sharing and preparation of human resource have been some of the areas where technology has acquired key significance . 
When we talk about education and development , there is no denying the fact that the marginalised sections of our society are an important resource and deserve more focused attention . 
Historically , India has had a strong education system both at the school and university levels . 
Our ancient universities - Takshashila , Nalanda , Vikramashila , Valabhi , Somapura and Odantapuri – were renowned seats of learning that attracted scholars from different parts of the world . 
In fact , for almost 1500 years , from the founding of Takshashila university in 3rd century BC to the collapse of Nalanda university in 12th Century AD , India was a world leader in the field of higher education . 
Through the UGC’s ‘Connect to India Programme’ I invite you to gain insights into our education systems as well as an understanding of our rich cultural heritage and society . 
Hopefully , there will be many more exchanges and collaborative research programmes in future which will serve as an impetus in furthering excellence in higher education across the globe . 
I hope the 10 day course which you are attending will leave imprints of the diverse Indian culture and social potentials of this country on your minds . 
My best wishes to you for all your future endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF INTERNATIONAL LITERACY DAY , 2014
I am indeed happy to be present amidst you this afternoon in celebrating International Literacy Day . 
It is an occasion to remind ourselves ofthe significance of the ability to read and write . 
It is an opportunity to highlight the learning opportunities that can and should be taken up by those who want to learn these skills . 
It is a juncture when all the stakeholders reinforce their commitment to the common goals . 
Today , we celebrate the successful endeavours of individuals and organisations and we recognise those who have made an outstanding contribution for spreading adult literacy . 
Literacy leads to education in the full sense of the term . 
It results in the acquisition of essential knowledge and proficiency . 
These are the instruments for the effective functioning of an individual – both in his group and in the larger community to which he belongs . 
They empower him and enable him to broaden his horizons and work for his own interest and that of the larger community . 
Literacy , in its contemporary definition , means " reading the world” rather than " the word” . 
It enables more perceptive and thus more effective exchanges of thoughts and ideas . 
These increase understanding and co - operation for achieving the objectives that a society collectively identifies . 
A literate - and , therefore , educated - society is better able to explore its way towards its inclusive economic and social well being through democratic means . 
Thus it follows that the more literate a society , the greater its overall integration , growth and development . 
The plan of action for eradication of illiteracy should , therefore , not only focus on the tangible aspects of literacy but also delve into its intangible and intrinsic aspects . 
The Father of our Nation , Mahatma Gandhi once observed , " illiteracy is a sin and shame and must be eradicated” . 
Today , more than 67 years after our independence , where are we ? 
The literacy rate has increased by four times from 18 % in 1951 to about 74 % in 2011 . 
Despite this , our literacy level is below the world average of 84 % . 
A target of 80 % has been set for achievement by the end of the 12th Plan . 
In this period , we aim to also reduce the gender gap from 16 to 10 percentage points . 
However our progress in adult literacy has been uneven and wide disparities are still seen . 
While States like Kerala , Himachal Pradesh and Mizoram have done reasonably well , many other States are lagging behind . 
The Schedule Castes , Schedule Tribes , Minorities and other disadvantaged groups , which constitute a sizeable part of our population , have very much lower rates of literacy . 
There is , thus , an urgent need to focus attention on these groups to help them to catch up so that we can move faster towards the national targets . 
Gender disparity in literacy is another important challenge . 
As we have been told , male and female literacy rates are 80 . 89 and 64 . 64 percent respectively . 
We need to do much better . 
Government of India rightly considers female literacy as a force multiplier for its social development programmes . 
In this context , I was glad to note that the National Literacy Mission has enhanced its focus on female literacy . 
If the Mission enables the Indian woman to take charge of her life and health and feel more confident in her immediate physical and social environment ; if literacy helps her to overcome deprivation , discrimination and injustice , then we can say that an important objective has been achieved . 
As I have said before , our objective should be to bring the literacy rate not only at par with the world average but to the levels attained by the leading societies of the world . 
I am happy to learn that the Saakshar Bharat Programme with institutional frame work at National , State , District , Block as well as Gram Panchayat level is operational in rural areas of low female literacy districts in the country . 
The Lok Shiksha Kendras established in over 1 . 5 lakhs Gram Panchayats are a good initiative . 
I am also pleased to learn of the " Volunteer–based mass campaign” approach of the programme - in which ‘Volunteers’ act as mobilisers , trainers and teachers of non - literates . 
I congratulate the Volunteers participating in these campaigns and thank them for their service for the cause of literacy . 
I would also like to recognise the outstanding efforts of the ‘learners’ , those neo - literates who have also responded to the Government programmes . 
They have enthusiastically participated in the ‘Assessment and Certification’ initiative introduced in 2010 to assess the literacy skills of adult learners . 
It is satisfying to see that since the introduction of this programme , about 2 . 86 crore learners have been certified as literate and awarded certificates by the National Institute of Open Schooling . 
I am told that groups of successful participants or ‘neo - literates’ as they are called , have been invited from various states to participate in today’s celebrations . 
I am sure they will be inspired to use their learning productively and spread its benefits . 
I would expect them to reinforce the efforts of Government and Voluntary Agencies by promoting the adult literacy programmes in their respective spheres of influence . 
We have still miles to go to accomplish what we have set out to achieve . 
While the primary focus of Saakshar Bharat remains on imparting of functional literacy to adult non - literates , there is a growing demand for giving access to basic education to the neo - literates emerging from the literacy programmes . 
This is a good proposal ; it will help the neo - literates make use of their learning ; they will have the opportunity of access to the formal schooling that they never had . 
A beginning in this direction has been made through the " Equivalency Programme” . 
I would stress that the success of our march towards total literacy in India will ultimately depend on two factors . 
One is meaningful and effective advocacy and , secondly , cooperation and support of society at large , to bring non - literates into the mainstream of literacy . 
Adult Education in India has , so far , been primarily the responsibility of Government with a degree of involvement of Voluntary Agencies . 
The National Literacy Mission Authority encourages the Corporate and Private sector to join the Government efforts and contribute by bringing in a variety of synergies . 
I am happy to learn that this has had a good response . 
I would , therefore , take this opportunity to call upon State Governments , Panchayati Raj Institutions on one hand and on the other , appeal all the stakeholders in a resurgent India – the Corporate and Private Sectors , Voluntary agencies and Civil Society Organisations - to work together , in unison and with greater vigour to realise this goal . 
With these words , I would like to congratulate all the winners of Saakshar Bharat Awards 2014 and the Ministry of Human Resource Development for instituting these awards . 
I have no doubt that these awards will inspire further efforts in the direction of total literacy in India . 
I thank the National Literacy Mission Authority and Iwish the participants in this Programme great success in their endeavours . 
Literacy leads to education in the full sense of the term . It results in the acquisition of essential knowledge and proficiency . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE PRESENTATION OF NATIONAL AWARD TO TEACHERS
I am delighted to be with you today on the occasion of the presentation of the National Award on Teachers Day . 
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the teachers who are receiving the Award for their commendable work and service to the nation . 
Today , the 5th of September , is the birth anniversary of the former President of India Dr . Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , a great philosopher , thinker , scholar and educationist of the country . 
Very many years ago , he had perceptively remarked and I quote : 
Education should be imparted with a view to the type of society that we wish to build . 
We are working for a modern democracy built on the values of human dignity and equality . 
These are only ideals : we should make them living forces . Our vision of the future should include these great principles
The Teachers Day celebration is a mark of our respect and gratitude to the teaching community . 
Children are the future of the nation . 
They are , in fact , the foundation on which a strong , vibrant and dynamic India shall be built . 
Children are exposed in their formative years most to their parents and teachers , who have a tremendous responsibility towards inculcating in their young minds a sense of values , discipline , dedication and commitment to the nation
A robust and quality - oriented education system is the force multiplier that shall transform India into one of the leading nations of the world . We as a nation are now investing substantially in our education system . 
In the Union Budget for 2014 - 15 Government has allocated an amount of almost Rs . 29 , 000 crore for ‘Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’ and approximately another Rs . 5000 crore for ‘Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan’ . 
Other important initiatives include launching of a School Assessment Programme and the " Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya New Teachers Training Programme” for imparting new training tools and motivating teachers . 
In the era of Information & Communication Technology ( ICT ) , teaching - learning processes are changing . 
Teachers have to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies . 
It is vital for teachers to be comfortable in using ICT and to ensure that students get full benefit of ICT and emerge as citizens knowledgeable in the use of the information technology with the aim of pursuing higher education or entering the job market with relevant IT skills . 
To take advantage of the reach of the IT , Government has in the recent budget made allocations for setting up virtual classrooms as Communication Linked Interface for Cultivating Knowledge ( CLICK ) and online courses . 
Teachers influence the life of students by being their role models . 
They are the beacons of light who guide and motivate students throughout their academic life and , many a times , even beyond . 
India today needs many more competent and willing teachers to dedicate themselves to improving the standard and quality of education being currently imparted . Teachers have a vital role to play in the process of upgrading the quality of education which is a direct consequence and outcome of the quality of teachers . 
A teacher ideally is one who facilitates his students in realising and maximising their potential . 
In recognition of this stellar role , teachers have since time immemorial been accorded a special place in our society . 
They have been called Acharyas in our ancient texts since they transmit the norms of acceptable conduct to our future generations . 
It is important that they impart not only knowledge and learning but also our traditional values which form the bedrock of our civilization dating several millennia . 
The Father of the Nation , Mahatma Gandhi , believed that student interest in learning is sustained not only by the subject matter of study but also , most importantly , by the teacher . 
Gandhiji recalled his childhood days to illustrate this point . 
He was taught Chemistry by two teachers . 
The teaching of one was continuous and without explanation ; the elucidation of the other was such that Gandhiji wished the class would never end . 
The instruction by one was absorbing and by the other insipid . 
I am sure all of us have had similar experiences during our student days where we have come face to face with teachers who have provided the necessary spark to light our creative journey . 
The difference an outstanding teacher makes to the learning process is central to the spirit of inquiry that needs to be kindled in young minds . 
The big challenge that we in India today face is to improve the quality of teaching and learning outcomes in our schools . 
This cannot be done without upgrading the skill and knowledge quotient of our teachers and without involving them fully as equal partners in the nation’s progress . 
The world today faces challenges of violence , terrorism , intolerance and environmental degradation . 
The values of truth , tolerance , integrity , secularism and inclusiveness need to be imparted to our children to make the world a safer and better place to live in . 
Dear Teachers , please remember that your mentoring and your way of educating our children must be such that it transforms them into capable , knowledgeable and worthy global citizens . 
We are aware that our teachers are working under diverse contexts and conditions . 
We also know that the working conditions of teachers in many places are sub - optimal . 
However , over time there have been substantial improvements in salary scales and in the construction of proper school buildings with toilets and drinking water . 
Regular up - gradation programmes for teachers , in - service training and near at hand academic support systems have also been instituted across the length and breadth of our country . 
These constitute welcome steps , and are part of an ongoing process , aimed at making the work environment for our teachers positive and encouraging . 
As teachers you devote countless hours of selfless service to the nation in nurturing our most valued resource – our children . 
Society and the country have high expectations from you . 
I am sure you will live up to these expectations in ample measure . 
I once again express my deep appreciation and gratitude to all of you , across the length and breadth of the country , who are imparting knowledge and learning to our future generations with dedication and sincerity . 
I also take this opportunity to congratulate all the 357 teachers who are being awarded today for their outstanding contribution in the field of education . I wish them the very best in their future endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE DELIVERING DR . B . R . AMBEDKAR MEMORIAL LECTURE 2014 ON ‘VISION OF INDIA IN 21ST CENTURY , AS ENVISAGED BY DR . AMBEDKAR’
I am happy to deliver the fifth Dr . B . R . Ambedkar Memorial Lecture for the year 2014 being organised by the Dr . Ambedkar Foundation . 
I am grateful to Hon’ble Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Thawar Chand Gehlot and the organisers for giving me this honour . 
Dr . Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar , was an outstanding leader of our freedom struggle and a staunch crusader for the rights of the down - trodden and backward sections of our society . 
A recipient of the Bharat Ratna , he was a scholar , journalist , educationist , legal luminary , social reformer and political leader . 
He was the principal architect of the Indian Constitution and shall always be remembered for his role in painstakingly drafting our founding document . 
Dr . Ambedkar ' s philosophy and life are a profile of courage and conviction . 
He dedicated himself to the pursuit of knowledge overcoming many adversities on account of his caste and poor economic background . 
He graduated from Elphinstone College in Mumbai and thereafter was awarded a scholarship to attend Columbia University in New York from where he obtained his Doctorate . 
Then , he moved to the United Kingdom in 1916 where he studied at the London School of Economics and was subsequently awarded the degree of Barrister - at - Law by Gray’s Inn . 
After his return to India , Dr . Ambedkar became the voice of the depressed classes and started many organisations to promote their cause . 
Dr . Ambedkar’s legacy and contribution to India can be seen in many fields . 
His PhD thesis of 1923 titled " The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India”provided academic basis for the Finance Commission of India which was subsequently established through Article 280 of the Constitution to address problems of vertical and horizontal imbalances in finances . 
Similarly , the Reserve Bank of India was conceptualized based on the guidelines presented by Dr . Ambedkar to the " Royal Commission on Indian Currency & Finance” in 1925 . 
Commission members found Dr . Ambedkar’s book " The Problem of the Rupee - Its Problems and Its Solution” an invaluable reference tool and the Central Legislative Assembly eventually passed these guidelines as the RBI Act 1934 . 
As Labour Minister in the Viceroy’s Council , Dr Ambedkar successfully led the struggle for reduction of work from 12 hours a day to 8 hours in 1942 . 
He contributed the idea of setting up of Employment Exchanges in India . 
He was almost single handedly responsible for establishing the Central Technical Power Board , the National Power Grid System and the Central Water Irrigation and Navigation Commission . 
Dr . Ambedkar played an important role in the establishment of the Damodar Valley project , Hirakud project and Sone river project . 
A voracious reader Dr . Ambedkar saw education as a tool for the liberation of the socially backward from illiteracy , ignorance and superstition . 
He founded the People ' s Education Society in 1945 with the aim of advancing the educational interests of weaker sections of society . 
Dr . Ambedkar was also a crusader for gender equality and fought for equal rights for women in inheritance and marriage . 
He resigned from the Cabinet in 1951 when his draft Hindu Code Bill failed to receive the support of the Parliament . 
Undoubtedly , Dr . Ambedkar’s biggest and most important contribution was in his role as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of India . 
With tremendous foresight and erudite scholarship , Dr . Ambedkar not only piloted an outstanding draft through the Constituent Assembly but also outlined the philosophy and wisdom behind the various provisions . 
The topic of today’s lecture is the ‘Vision of India in 21st Century , as envisaged by Dr . Ambedkar’ . 
Dr . Ambedkar was clear in his mind that he wanted to see a socio - economic and political transformation of India . 
He wanted the vast multitude of people of India to enjoy freedom and equality of opportunities . 
He wanted to rid India of casteism and communalism and bring education and development to every corner of the country . 
He wanted India to emerge as a modern state where liberty , equality and fraternity flourishes and backwardness is wiped out . 
Dr . Ambedkar believed in radical change , but he did not want this change to happen through bloodshed . 
He wanted transformation through parliamentary democracy and rule of law . 
Dr . Ambedkar saw great potential in using the Indian Constitution as a powerful instrument of socio - economic transformation and with this intention , introduced into the draft Constitution a variety of provisions which would enable full accountability of the Government , checks and balances , protection of fundamental rights , independent institutions and consistent movement towards social democracy . 
Dr . Ambedkar’s speeches in the Constituent Assembly are of great educational value to students of our Constitution and modern political history . 
Dr . Ambedkar explained to the Constituent Assembly in a speech introducing the draft Constitution on November 4 , 1948 the pros and cons of the Parliamentary form of Government vis - a - vis the Presidential system . 
He also explained why the Draft Constitution , in recommending an Executive based on the Parliamentary system preferred ‘responsibility’ to ‘stability’ . 
Both systems of Government are of course democratic and the choice between the two is not very easy . 
A democratic executive must satisfy two conditions –
It must be a stable executive
It must be a responsible executive . 
Unfortunately it has not been possible so far to devise a system which can ensure both in equal degree . 
You can have a system which can give you more stability but less responsibility or you can have a system which gives you more responsibility but less stability . . . . . . . . . 
Under the non - Parliamentary system , such as the one that exists in the U . S . A . , the assessment of the responsibility of the Executive is periodic . 
It is done by the Electorate . In England , where the Parliamentary system prevails , the assessment of responsibility of the Executive is both daily and periodic . 
The daily assessment is done by members of Parliament , through questions , Resolutions , No - confidence motions , Adjournment motions and Debates on Addresses . 
Periodic assessment is done by the Electorate at the time of the election which may take place every five years or earlier . 
The Daily assessment of responsibility , which is not available under the American system , is , it is felt , far more effective than the periodic assessment and far more necessary in a country like India . 
The Draft Constitution in recommending the Parliamentary system of Executive has preferred more responsibility to more stability . 
Dr . Ambedkar described how the President under the Constitution will occupy the same position as the King under the English Constitution : 
He is the head of the State but not of the Executive . 
He represents the Nation but does not rule the Nation . 
He is the symbol of the nation . 
His place in the administration is that of a ceremonial device on a seal by which the nation ' s decisions are made known…
The President of the Indian Union will be generally bound by the advice of his Ministers . 
He can do nothing contrary to their advice nor can he do anything without their advice . 
Commenting on the unique nature of the federation proposed in the draft Constitution , Dr . Ambedkar explained why a federal form of government tailored to suit the exigencies of the Indian situation was the need of the hour . 
The Draft Constitution is , Federal Constitution in as much as it establishes what may be called a Dual Polity . 
This Dual Polity under the proposed Constitution will consist of the Union at the Centre and the States at the periphery each endowed with sovereign powers to be exercised in the field assigned to them respectively by the Constitution . . . . . . . . . . 
The Draft Constitution can be both unitary as well as federal according to the requirements of time and circumstances . In normal times , it is framed to work as a federal system . But in times of war it is so designed as to make it work as though it was a unitary system . 
Dr . Ambedkar was at pains to emphasise that the new republic would be a " Union” of States , as opposed to a " Federation” of States . The States would have no right to secede . 
He said : 
The Federation is a Union because it is indestructible . 
Though the country and the people may be divided into different States for convenience of administration the country is one integral whole , its people a single people living under a single imperium derived from a single source . 
Dr . Ambedkar ensured the inclusion of a well - defined and comprehensive chapter on Fundamental Rights which specifically abolished untouchability , guaranteed equal rights to all citizens and prohibited discrimination of all kinds in social relations . 
Dr . Ambedkar believed that protection of minorities and their religion was of paramount importance . 
Thus , the Constitution grants each person the freedom of faith , religion and worship and gives the minorities freedom to manage their religious affairs . 
Dr . Ambedkar justified such protection on the following grounds : 
It is wrong for the majority to deny the existence of minorities . 
It is equally wrong for the minorities to perpetuate themselves . 
A solution must be found which will serve a double purpose . 
It must recognize the existence of the minorities to start with . 
It must also be such that it will enable majorities and minorities to merge someday into one . 
The solution proposed by the Constituent Assembly is to be welcomed because it is a solution which serves this twofold purpose . 
Dr . Ambedkar played a crucial role in laying down the Directive Principles of State Policy , a unique feature of the Indian Constitution . 
These principles mandate that the State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting a just social order . 
These principles lay the foundation for a social democracy . 
In Dr . Ambedkar’s words
We must make our political democracy a social democracy as well . 
What does social democracy mean ? It means a way of life which recognizes liberty , equality and fraternity are the principles of life . 
These principles of liberty , equality and fraternity are not to be treated as separate items in a trinity . 
They form a union or trinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy . ………
Without equality , liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many . Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative . 
Without fraternity , liberty and equality would not become a natural course of thing . 
It would require a constable to enforce them… . . . . 
On the social plane , we have in India a society based on the principles of graded inequality which means elevation for some and degradation for others . 
On the economic plane , we have a society in which there are some who have immense wealth as against many who live in abject poverty ………… . 
How long shall we continue to live this life of contradiction ? 
We must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy……
The Directive Principles of State of Policy were criticised by some and termed mere " pious declarations” . Responding to this criticism , Dr . Ambedkar said : 
Whoever captures power will not be free to do what he likes with it . In the exercise of it , he will have to respect these instruments of instructions which are called Directive Principles . He cannot ignore them . 
He may not have to answer for their breach in a Court of Law . 
But he will certainly have to answer for them before the electorate at election time . 
Dr . Ambedkar was firm in his belief that our judiciary must both be independent of the executive and must also be competent in itself . 
He did recognise however that tussles between the executive and the judiciary were inevitable , and were in fact necessary to ensure that each acted as a check and balance on the functioning of the other . 
He observed : 
For myself I cannot altogether omit the possibility of a Legislature packed by party men making laws which may abrogate or violate what we regard as certain fundamental principles affecting the life and liberty of an individual . 
At the same time , I do not see how five or six gentlemen sitting in the Federal or Supreme Court examining laws made by the Legislature and by dint of their own individual conscience or their bias or their prejudices be trusted to determine which law is good and which law is bad . 
Dr . Ambedkar called upon the socially and economically disadvantaged to ‘educate , agitate and organise’ . 
Nevertheless , his commitment to constitutional methods was unwavering and he advocated a path of informed and reasoned public engagement . 
He said : 
We must abandon the bloody methods of revolution . ………When there was no way left for constitutional methods for achieving economic and social objectives , there was a great deal of justification for unconstitutional methods . 
But where constitutional methods are open , these can be no justification for these unconstitutional methods . 
These methods are nothing but the grammar of anarchy and sooner they are abandoned , the better for us . 
Dr . Ambedkar believed that strong independent institutions constituted the fundamental pillars of a democracy and it is they who would ensure its survival . 
He ensured that the Constitution provided for an independent judiciary and that the right to Constitutional Remedies was a fundamental right . 
Speaking about Article 32 – the Right to Constitutional Remedies , Dr . Ambedkar said : 
If I was asked to name any particular article in this Constitution as the most important – an article without which the Constitution would be a nullity - I could not refer to any other article except this one . 
Dr . Ambedkar called for an independent Election commission and instituted the same through Article 324 of the Constitution . 
In his words : 
the greatest safeguard for purity of elections , for fairness in elections , was to take away the matter from the hands of the executive authority and to hand it over to some independent authority . 
It must be mentioned in this regard that the Election Commission of Indiahas since gone on to win widespread and appreciation within the country and across the praise world . 
Our very first Chief Election Commissioner Shri Sukumar Sen was invited to supervise the elections in Sudan and since then , the services and expertise of our Election Commission has been sought by many countries . 
We have also just witnessed the efficiency and independence with which the elections to the 16th Lok Sabha was recently , held despite the enormous diversity of our nation and an electorate size of around 834 million people . 
The Election Commission was a single member Commission till October 1989 when two additional Commissioners were appointed for the first time making it a multi - member commission
Similarly , on the post of Auditor General , he said : 
I am of opinion this dignitary or officer is probably the most important officer in the Constitution of India . 
He is the one man who is going to see that the expenses voted by Parliament are not exceeded , or varied from what has been laid down by Parliament in what is called the Appropriation Act . 
If this functionary is to carry out the duties and his duties , I submit , are far more important than the duties even of the judiciary . . . . . . . I personally feel that he ought to have far greater independence than the Judiciary itself . . . . . . 
Dr . Ambedkar was clear that no Constitution is perfect and ultimately the working of the Constitution will depend upon the people , the political parties and their politics . 
He stated emphatically about the Constitution : 
It is workable , it is flexible and it is strong enough to hold the country together both in peace time and in war time . Indeed , if I may so , if things go wrong under the new Constitution , the reason will not be that we had a bad Constitution . 
What we will have to say is that man is vile . 
It must be noted in the above regard that in practice our political system has been innovative and flexible . 
Dr . Ambedkar’s commitment to the building of strong institutions and constitutional methods has resulted in many interesting modern day manifestations . 
For example , the Right to Information Act is a unique and powerful instrument created by law to empower people and enable them access information from any department of the Government on any subject advancing thereby openness and transparency . 
Similarly , the Supreme Court of India through Public Interest Litigation has enabled the common man access the highest courts of justice by just sending a post card . 
High Courts and Supreme Court have also takensuo motu cognizance of violation of fundamental rights and initiated action on their own setting aside the conventional notions of locus standi . 
Finally , we witnessed recently the phenomenon of a popular agitation led by Shri Anna Hazare resulting in civil society gaining direct voice in the legislative process hitherto reserved only for elected members of the Parliament and state Legislatures . 
A draft Lok Pal bill was finalized through consultation between representatives of civil society and senior members of the Government prior to presentation in Parliament and subsequent adoption as law . 
All the above reflect the strength of Indian democracy and the dynamism of the Constitution . 
India’s journey since independence has seen many successes . 
The greatest challenge for our founding fathers was to come up with a viable system of government . 
We have in the last 67 years established a successful parliamentary democracy , an independent Judiciary and strong institutions like the Election Commission , CAG etc . to sustain and support our political system . 
The biggest and the most complex issue that independent India had to address was the issue of the political , social and economic exclusion of a significant segment of our population . 
A unique and comprehensive policy of affirmative action was adopted through the Constitution to empower members of communities which were socially excluded and to bring them into the national mainstream . 
India is , today recognised across the world for our democratic and secular values as well as for establishing an inclusive and modern social order . 
On the economic front , we have made many significant gains , taking a substantial segment of our people from below the poverty line to a level of dignified existence . 
India is now the third largest economy in the world terms of PPP . 
In last six decades , the poverty ratio has declined from over 60 per cent to less than 30 per cent . 
India has become a nation of considerable economic strength , admired for its advanced scientific and technological capabilities , industrial base and its world class human resources . 
It is a reality , however that despite all the achievements in which we can take legitimate pride , our democracy continues to face many challenges . 
Large number of Indians still live in poverty , deprivation and want . 
Casteism too sadly remains a phenomenon we are yet to wipe out from our country and society . 
Dr . Ambedkar dreamt of an India in which all sections of society are empowered – socially , economically and politically ; an India in which every section of our population believes that they have an equal stake in the country and its future and an India in which social status will be decided not by standing in caste hierarchy or economic wealth but by individual merit . 
Dr . Ambedkar’s vision was of an India where the social system and economy would permit the full development of human potential and ensure a dignified existence for all our citizens . 
Each one of us has a responsibility to do our utmost to make Dr . Ambedkar’s dreams come true . 
We must do everything possible to preserve and strengthen our democracy . 
We must engage in combined and committed efforts to overcome poverty and prejudice . 
We need to be constantly on the guard against divisive forces raising their heads in the country . 
We should address with utmost of speed the challenges of malnutrition , ignorance , unemployment and infrastructure . 
We must also ensure that untouchability or any form of disability based on caste , creed , religion or sex is not practised in any part of the country . 
It is only through these endeavours can we occupy our rightful place in the leading ranks of the comity of nations . 
Dr . Ambedkar’s message , work and life are a constant reminder of the outstanding Constitution , strong democracy and effective , independent institutions we have inherited from the founding fathers of our nation . 
At the same time , it also reminds us of the distance we still need to travel in building an egalitarian society where there will be no distinction between man and man . 
Let me conclude recalling Dr . Ambedkar’s words from his address to the Constituent Assembly on November 25 , 1949 : 
In addition to our old enemies in the form of castes and creeds , we are going to have many political parties with diverse and opposing political creeds . 
Will Indians place the country above their creed or will they place creed above country ? 
I do not know . 
But this much is certain that if the parties place creed above country , our independence will be put in jeopardy a second time and probably be lost forever . 
This eventuality we must all resolutely guard against . 
We must be determined to defend our independence with the last drop of our blood . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE RELEASE OF A SET OF EIGHT COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP OF INDIAN MUSICIANS
It gives me great pleasure to release this set of commemorative postage stamps today . 
As we pay tribute to eight of the greatest music maestros of contemporary India , we celebrate their life and work and their matchless legacy . 
These eight maestros are , without a doubt , among the tallest luminaries in the history of world music . 
They have not only achieved personal perfection but have made extraordinary contributions , in their respective fields , to the development and evolution of the schools of music in which their talents were nurtured and honed . 
Their contribution and its enrichment of our cultural heritage cannot be quantified or estimated . 
It is infinite in its resonance and their names will be mentioned withgreat reverence . 
Their music will be cherished by the young and old , for many decades to come . 
I congratulate the Department of Posts for their initiative in bringing out these stamps . 
As these travel , pasted on letters and parcels and as they are added to the collections of stamp collectors and music connoisseurs and as they are used by people across the continents , these stamps will inform and remind all who see them of a golden era in musical achievements , a high point in the history ofshastriya sangeet in India . 
At this juncture , when we Indians , as a people , we are deeply involved with so many things , political processes and economic growth and development , while also facing the challenges of a globalized world , it is comforting and invigorating to pause and reflect on our unique cultural heritage . 
Music , in its pure form , is spiritual nourishment for our souls . 
It is at the core of our cultural and secular heritage . 
Our classical music , which has its origin in the Vedas , is said to be a gift of God himself ; it isNadabrahma , the sound of God , the music that pervades the universe . 
Although one cannot sum up the achievements of these gifted souls in just a few words , I would like to pay homage by recalling a few aspects of their outstanding contribution to Indian music . 
Ustad Ali Akbar Khan made his debut at the age of 13 at a music conference in Allahabad in 1936 . His mastery of the sarod and his brilliant compositions gave him the title of a ‘national treasure’ . 
As a performer and as a teacher , he popularized Indian classical music - not only in India but also in Europe and in the USA . 
Pundit Bhimsen Joshi had developed the khayal form of singing . 
He was best known for his popular renditions of devotional music . He was a classicist by training and temperament but evolved an approach that sought to achieve a balance between " traditional values and mass - culture tastes " . 
Smt . D . K . Pattammal , who started her training at the age of only four years , went on to become a legend in Carnatic Music . 
She achieved the highest levels in her field of music . 
Along with Smt . M S Subbalakshmi and Smt . M L Vasanthakumari , she was considered one of the " Female Trinity of Carnatic Music” . 
Her perfect rendering ofRagam Tanam - Pallavi , a composition that had all along been a domain of male artists , earned her the title of " Pallavi Pattammal” . 
Smt . Gangubai Hangal , another child - prodigy , made her debut in the 1924 session of the Indian National Congress in the august presence of Mahatma Gandhi , Jawaharlal Nehru , Sarojini Naidu and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad . 
She fought prejudice and opposition to make music her career and remained committed to classical music for 75 years - until her last concert in 2006 . 
Pundit Kumar Gandharva is remembered for his creation of new ragas and for bringing the spotlight to the music of Madhya Pradesh . 
His legacy includes his amazing experimentation withNirguni bhajansand folksongs . 
Pt . Mallikarjun Mansurof the Jaipur - Atrauli Gharana had set new standards through his mercurial improvisations in both melody and metre - without ever losing the emotional content of the songs that he rendered . 
Pundit Ravi Shankar , will forever be remembered for the heights that he conquered as a legendary sitar player and composer of Hindustani classical music . 
He popularized the sitar in all parts of the world with his brilliant performances and creative compositions . 
His use of unconventional rhythmic cycles and unique compositions remain unrivaled to this day . 
Ustad Vilayat Ali Khan , who introduced Indian music to the world along with Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan was another of the greatest pioneers of Indian classical music . 
He is undoubtedly one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , ours is a generation that had the privilege of knowing and witnessing the awe - inspiring performances of these eight brilliant artistes . 
Future generations will marvel at their genius . Many among us have been blessed with the opportunity to have personally known and experienced their uncommon prowess . 
I , personally , do fervently believe that the music of India in all its diversity is one of the greatest gifts to human civilization . 
I congratulate Department of Posts for bringing out these Commemorative Postage Stamps : by honouring these great legendary figures the country is honouring itself . 
These stamps will be placed in the newly opened Museum of the Rashtrapati Bhavan where visitors from the different parts of India and abroad will be able to see them from this weekend onwards . 
I wish you success in this and your future initiatives . 
EXTRACTS FROM SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE 14TH CONVOCATION OF UNIVERSITY OF JAMMU
I am delighted to be with you today on the occasion of the 14th Convocation of the University of Jammu . 
I extend my good wishes to all the graduating students and hope that they will do exceedingly well in their chosen careers in the years to come . 
I am glad to learn that the University of Jammu is making rapid strides in all areas of its functioning . 
The University through its main campus , offsite campuses , affiliated colleges and Directorate of Distance Education offers a wide range of programmes in areas such as Arts , Business Studies , Life Sciences , Social Sciences , Mathematical Sciences , Education , Law , Engineering and Medicine . Such a vast canvas naturally enables students to fully utilize their potentialities and excel . 
The University is also involved in world class research through ‘A Large Ion Collider Experiment’ ( ALICE ) collaboration and is a part of the Indian team involved at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) Experiment at the World Laboratory ‘European Council for Nuclear Research’ ( CERN ) , Geneva . 
The setting up of the National Apple Germplasm Repository at its campus in Bhaderwah is indeed an important step towards conservation of an important genetic resource of the country . 
I congratulate the University on it being listed as one of the twenty nine universities in the country under the " Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence” ( PURSE ) programme of the Department of Science and Technology , Government of India . 
The University has also hosted , for the first time ever in Jammu & Kashmir , the 101st session of the Indian Science Congress . 
These recognitions are a tribute to the quality of leadership as also , in equal measure , to the untiring efforts of the faculty , research and technical staff , students and all other stakeholders . 
It is also noteworthy that the University has been identified as a " Level 1” point - of - presence on the National Knowledge Network , given that technology and the internet have virtually revolutionized the teaching - learning process . 
Indeed , it is with a sense of satisfaction that I say that the University of Jammu has created for itself a niche in the academic field . 
Notwithstanding these achievements , you cannot afford to be complacent and rely on your past laurels . 
As it is with everything else , as in the field of education also , you will need to constantly strive for excellence in a global orderwhich is dynamic , ever - changing and dismissive of mediocrity . 
Higher education in India faces great challenges today . 
On a broader platform , the XIIth Plan places a high priority on education as an instrument for achieving accelerated and inclusive growth with emphasis on expansion , excellence and equity . 
Quality up - gradation of state - level institutions , which account for 96 percent of the higher education capacity , needs to be accorded high priority . 
The Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan ( RUSA ) is an important initiative in this direction . 
An important focus area is the role of innovation in higher education . 
While several policy initiatives have been taken in this area , these need to be implemented effectively to revitalize and boost the higher education framework in the country . 
One concept that has attracted attention , and will mark a paradigm shift in higher education , is that of the Meta University . 
The student must be given complete flexibility and be benefited by the expertise , courses of study and infrastructure available in other Universities and institutions of higher learning . 
Thus , a student enrolled in a management programme in the University of Jammu should be able to take up a course in Philosophy in Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University , Katra . 
This kind of flexibility will create an environment conducive to innovation and promote inter - disciplinary approaches . 
It will also expand access while making the best use of technology . 
Another inter - linked aspect is that of innovation and entrepreneurship . 
Realizing the centrality of innovation in the growth and development process , 2010 - 20 has been declared as the Decade of Innovation . 
India’s Science , Technology and Innovation ( STI ) policy 2013 emphasizes boosting innovation through research and development ( R & D ) , driven mainly by private sector participation , publishing more research papers , achieving gender parity in S & T and seeking global cooperation . 
It is here that University’s third axis , the first two being teaching and research , becomes critical . 
While it is well recognised the world over , enterprise incubation as a part of the academia - industry linkage is still at a nascent stage in India . 
Some IITs and IIMs have set up formal incubation centres over the years to foster innovation , research and entrepreneurial activities in technology based areas . 
Universities today need to become drivers of innovation . 
Their focus should be on collaborative relationships with industry and Government . 
Entrepreneurial activities in the universities could take various forms such as contract research , consultancy , patenting , licensing , spin outs , start - ups , incubating companies etc . 
It is essential that Universities create the right environment for promoting entrepreneurship amongst students as well as academicians . 
The State of Jammu and Kashmir is emerging as a knowledge hub in the country with nine universities and more than 300 affiliated colleges . 
All these institutions would benefit by collaborating in teaching and research and establishing common research facilities . 
The University of Jammu should move towards establishing research clusters to enable scholars and faculty members to explore emerging research areas , especially related to local and regional needs , and to collaborate with industry and research organisations . 
Some of the major thrust areas would be Horticulture , Floriculture , Soil dynamics , Seismology , Organic farming , Tourism , Precious gems , Handicrafts etc . 
I am sure that over time the University shall boast of world class , state - of - the - art research and innovation facilities along with the necessary eco - system to sustain them . 
Most importantly , however , it will be the quality , spirit and ethos of the students and faculty which will determine the footprints you leave on the sands of time . 
All the graduating students would do well to remember that they are central to the vision of an India which is dynamic , prosperous , equitous , all embracing and inclusive . 
I can do no better than quote Mahatma Gandhi , the Father of Nation : 
You are the hope of the future . 
You will be called upon , when you are discharged from your College , to enter upon public life to lead the poor people of this country . 
I would , therefore , like you students to have a sense of your responsibilities and show it in a tangible manner . 
I once again wish you all the best in your future endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
I am indeed happy to be here today on the occasion of the Bengal Engineering and Science University ( BESU ) being converted into the first Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology ( IIEST ) . 
IIEST , Shibpur shall now be an ‘Institute of National Importance’ , a richly deserved honour . 
The Institute shall integrate under - graduate education , post - graduate education and research in engineering and science under the same umbrella conforming , over time , to international standards . 
India also looks forward to the Institute producing quality manpower for our strategic sectors , research laboratories as also quality teachers for higher technical education . 
This eminent institution has been blessed with a rich and glorious history of a hundred and fifty eight years . 
Its evolution from relatively modest beginnings to an institute of national importance is the result of the sincere , dedicated , and selfless work of a large number of its teachers , students and staff members over the last more than hundred and fifty years . 
To the Institute’s credit it focusses on all - round development of its students rather than academics alone . 
During my last visit in 2011 to inaugurate the " Students’ Centre for Creative Expression” I was happy to observe students taking part in many creative activities alongside their studies . 
It is heartening to know that the students of the Institute are doing commendably well in all spheres of education , sports , and cultural activities . 
The Institute has made significant advancements in several areas of human endeavour . 
In particular , they are actively seeking to address some of the global challenges today in areas as diverse as renewable energy , water technology , medical and environmental sciences . 
Some other important areas of engagement are Disaster Management ; Clean coal technology ; Power Electronics ; Remote - sensing and GIS ; Space Technology ; Biochemical Sensors , Structural Engineering ; VLSI and Embedded Systems . 
A sound education system is the foundation of an enlightened society . 
Our institutes of higher learning are the nurseries of our future administrators and policy makers . 
They need to inculcate in students progressive thinking and core civilizational values of integrity , compassion , pluralism , respect for women , tolerance and responsible action . 
Though we boast of a vast higher education network of over 720 degree - awarding institutions and 37 , 000 colleges , the quality of standards in many is a cause for concern . 
It is indeed a sad commentary that a country like India which in the distant past boasted of universities like Nalanda and Takshashila does not today have a single educational institution in the top 200 universities in the world . 
In order to accomplish this , a culture of excellence must be promoted in our higher academic institutions and core competencies nurtured . 
Academic cooperation between institutions must be encouraged . 
Research and innovation must go hand in hand and should be focused on solving our country’s myriad developmental problems . 
It is also important that industry and academia operate in tandem and create the right synergies and environment for industrial growth and academic rejuvenation . 
I understand from the Director’s report that apart from in - house academic research , the University also has a strong base of industrial research and that , in the recent past , it has witnessed an upsurge in collaborations with reputed foreign technical universities as also with several industries in India . 
I hope this trend continues and that there is considerable expansion in the scope and content of faculty development and student exchange programmes within the ambit of such collaborations . 
With these few words , I once again extend my warm wishes to all the faculty members and students on this momentous occasion of Bengal Engineering and Science University ( BESU ) being converted into the first Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology ( IIEST ) . 
I wish the Institute the very best in its future endeavours . 
I also take this opportunity to congratulate all the eminent persons who are being felicitated today . 
Jai Hind ! ! 
PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS TO THE NATION ON THE EVE OF INDIA’S 68TH INDEPENDENCE DAY
On the eve of 67thanniversary of our Independence , I extend warm greetings to you and to all Indians around the world . 
I convey my special greetings to members of our armed forces , paramilitary forces and internal security forces . 
I also congratulate all our sportspersons , who have participated and won laurels in the recently - concluded Commonwealth Games held at Glasgow . 
Freedom is a celebration ; independence is a challenge . 
In the 68thyear of freedom , we have reaffirmed the power of our individual and collective liberties by electing through a remarkably peaceful electoral process , a stable government with a clear majority for a single party , after three decades . 
The increase in voter turnout to 66 per cent from the last election’s 58 per cent shows the vitality of our democracy . 
This achievement has given us an opportunity to take up the challenge of governance by reforming the policies , practices and systems of governance so that the enormous aspirations of our people can be fulfilled with vision , commitment , integrity , speed and administrativecapability . 
Stagnant minds create immobile systems which become roadblocks to growth . 
India demands creative thinking in governance that enables fast - track development and ensures social harmony . 
The nation has to be placed above partisan impulses . 
The people come first . 
In a democracy , good governance is exercise of power for efficient and effective management of our economic and social resources for the well - being of the people . 
This power has to be exercised within the framework of the Constitution through the institutions of state . 
With the passage of time and changes in the eco - system , distortions do appear making some institutions dysfunctional . 
When one institution does not function in the manner expected of it , phenomenon of overreach sets in . 
While some new institutions might become necessary , the real solution lies in re - inventing and restoring the existing ones to serve the purpose of effective government . 
Good governance is critically dependent on rule of law , participatory decision - making , transparency , responsiveness , accountability , equity and inclusiveness . 
It calls for wider involvement of the civil society in the political process . 
It calls for deeper engagement of the youth with the institutions of democracy . 
It calls for quick dispensation of justice to the people . 
It calls for ethical and responsible behaviour from the media . 
A country of our size , heterogeneity and complexity calls for culture - specific governance models . 
It calls for cooperation in the exercise of power and assumption of responsibility , by all stakeholders . 
It calls for constructive partnership between the state and the citizen . 
It calls for taking a responsive administration to the door step of every hut and habitation in the land . 
The decisive challenge of our times is toendthe curse of poverty . 
The focus of our policies now has to move from alleviation of poverty to elimination of poverty . 
The difference is not mere semantics : alleviation is a process ; elimination is a time - defined objective . 
In last six decades , the poverty ratio has declined from over 60 per cent to less than 30 per cent . 
Even then , nearly one - third of our population still lives below the poverty line . 
Poverty is not a mere statistic . 
Poverty has a face , which becomesunbearable when it scars the visage of a child . 
The poor cannot , and will not , wait for yet another generation to see the very essentials of life - food , shelter , education and employment - being denied to them . 
The benefits from economic development must percolate down to the poorest of the poor . 
In the last decade , our economy grew at an average rate of 7 . 6 per cent per year . 
Though the growth rate was subdued at below 5 per cent during the last two years , I sense renewed vigour and optimism in the air . 
Signs of revival are visible . Our external sector has strengthened . 
Fiscal consolidation measures are beginning to show results . 
Notwithstanding occasional spurts , inflation has started moderating . 
However , food prices still remain a matter of serious concern . 
Record food grains production last year helped agriculture sector to grow at a healthy 4 . 7 per cent . 
Employment has increased by an average of about 4 per cent per year in the last decade . 
Manufacturing sector is on the rebound . 
The stage is now set for our economy to move on a high growth trajectory of 7 to 8 per cent , which is essentialto ensure the availability of adequate resources for equitable development . 
Economy is the material part of development . Education is the essential part of it . 
A sound education system is the bedrock of an enlightened society . 
It is the bounden duty of our educational institutions to provide quality education and inculcate the core civilizational values of love for motherland ; compassion for all ; tolerance for pluralism ; respect for women ; performance of duty ; honesty in life ; self - restraint in conduct , responsibility in action and discipline in young minds . 
By the end of the Twelfth Five Year Plan , we would have achieved a literacy rate of eighty per cent . 
But would we be able to say that we have provided quality education and skills to our children to be good citizens and successful professionals ? 
Our thoughts are influenced by our environment . 
" Yadrishi Bhavana Yasya ; Siddhir Bhavati Tadrishi” . 
It means , " Whatever are one’s thoughts , so will be the outcomes” . 
Clean environment breeds clean thoughts . 
Cleanliness is a markof self - respect . 
Ancient travellers like Megasthenes in the 4th Century BC , Fa Hien in the 5thCentury AD andHiuen Tsang in the 7thCentury AD , when they came to India , have written about the efficient administrative systems , with planned settlements and good urban infrastructure . 
What has gone wrong with us now ? 
Why can’t we keep ourenvironment free of filth ? 
The Prime Minister ' s call to honour the memory of Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary , by making India a clean country by 2019 is commendable , but it can be achieved only if eachIndian converts this into a national mission . 
Every road , every path , every office , every home , every hut , every river , every stream , every particle in the air around us can be kept clean , if we but cared just a little . 
We must nurture nature , so that nature continues to nurture us . 
Though an ancient civilization , India is a modern nation with modern dreams . 
Intolerance and violence is a betrayal of the letter and spirit of democracy . 
Those who believe in the poison drip of inflammatory provocation do not understand India ' s values or even its presentpolitical impulses . 
Indians know that progress , economic or social , is difficult without peace . 
This may be the appropriate moment to recall the great Shivaji ' s letter to Aurangzeb when the latter imposed jizya . 
Shivaji told the emperor that Shah Jehan , Jehangir and Akbar could also have levied this tax " but they did not give place to bigotry in their hearts , as they considered all men , high and low , created by God to be examples of the nature of diverse creeds and temperaments " . 
This 17th century epistle of Shivaji carries a message , which is universal . 
It must become a living testament that guides our behaviour today . 
We can least afford to forget this message at a time when an increasingly turbulent international environment has sparked off rising dangers in our region and beyond , some clearly visible , and some crawling out of the debris of unprecedented turmoil . 
Across parts of Asia and Africa , attempts are being made by radical militias to redraw the maps of nations to create ageography for theocratic ideology . 
India will feel the heat of blowback , particularly as it represents the values that reject extremism in all its manifestations . 
India is a beacon of democracy , equilibrium , inter - and - intra faith harmony . 
We must defend our secular fabric with vigour . 
Our security and foreign policies must combine the steel of strength with the velvet of diplomacy even as we persuade the like - minded as well as the hesitant to recognise the substantial dangers that breed within indifference . 
Our Constitution is a consequence of our democratic culture , which reflects our ancient values . 
It pains me to notethat thisgreat national asset is becoming increasingly vulnerable to rash excess . 
Our right to freedom continues to flourish , and may that always be the case , but what about our duty to the people ? 
I sometimes wonder : has our democracy become too noisy ? 
Have we lost the art of contemplation and calm thinking ? 
Is it not the time to restore the grandeur and glory of our institutions that have sustained and nourished our beautiful democracy ? 
Should not Parliament again become the great hall of sombre thought and well - debated legislation ? 
Should not our courts of law become temples of justice ? 
This calls for collective action by all the stakeholders . 
A nation is very young at 68 . 
India has the will , energy , intellect , values and unity to claim the 21stcentury . 
The vision to win the battle of freedom from poverty is set ; the journey will seemformidable only to those without conviction . 
As an old saying goes , " Sidhir Bhavati Karmaja” , which means , " success is born of action” . 
Now is the time for action ! 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE CALL ON BY PROBATIONERS OF INDIAN FOREST SERVICE 2013 - 15 BATCH
At the very outset , I welcome all of you in Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
I would like to congratulate you for joining the Indian Forest Service , one of the premier All India Services . 
It speaks of your academic excellence . By joining the Indian Forest Service , you have taken an important step forward in your professional career . 
This is just the beginning and you have a very rewarding and challenging career spanning over 33 - 35 years in the Government . 
Forests have been an integral part of Indian ethos and culture . 
ur Civilization has always derived its intellectual and spiritual strength from Forests . 
The qualities such as tolerance and assimilation are very unique to our ethos as the Indian civilization has its roots in the forests . 
Forests , therefore , are not merely a resource , but they encompass the cultural , spiritual and intellectual heritage of the country . 
The Government has entrusted you with responsibility of protecting this greatly valuable heritage . 
I am reminded of the famous wordings of the Father of our Nation , Mahatma Gandhi . He had said , " What we are doing to the forests of the world is but a mirror reflection of what we are doing to ourselves and to one another . ” . 
In the last few decades , the world has woken up to the threats to the very survival of mankind due to environmental degradation , depletion in forest cover and above all , global warming leading to Climate Change . 
That is why Environment has emerged as the prime agenda for the 21stCentury , of which forests are an integral part . 
To address adverse impacts arising out of climate change it is essential that countries come together to address this issue in a collective manner . 
Forests , being a potential carbon sink , may be one of the important ways to reduce the increasing green house gases in the atmosphere and consequent threat of global warming . 
It is a known fact that Mangrove forests on the coast protect the coastal areas from cyclones and tsunamis ; forests on the hill slopes protect the soils and prevent landslides and fresh floods ; healthy watersheds having good forest cover insulate areas from the draughts and increase agricultural productivity . 
Indeed , forests take very little from us but they give so much to the mankind . 
It is imperative for our country to adopt sound practices for forest management to address the local issues as well as the global issues . 
The recent landslide case near Pune is an eye - opener for us to act immediately with full conviction . 
The National Forest Policy aims at achieving 33 % forest cover for the land mass of our country . 
The total forest and tree cover is approximately 24 % , as per the India State Forest Survey Report 2013 . 
We are still away from our goal . You , as young , enthusiastic and creative minds , are well placed to push for accomplishing this national goal . 
Millions of poor people , including tribals , live in and around the forests of our country . 
These people look to the forest to meet their basic requirements of food , fuel wood , fodder and other small needs . 
I expect you to be sensitive to the needs of this segment of society . 
In the last few years our country has adopted joint forest management model , based upon care and share principle , which envisages participatory approach involving people in the management of the forests . 
You must take this forward and try to be a catalytic agent for the ecologically sustainable development of the communities living in and around the forests . 
There is no dearth of success models , wherein the forests could be effectively protected with the participation of the communities . 
With your experience , knowledge and training at your Academy , you can develop innovative model for participation of the communities for sharing of this natural wealth with the dependent community on the forest and also for conserving the forest itself . 
The management of forests and its governance is a challenging task . 
This can be made citizen - friendly through extensive use of technology . 
I understand that Ministry is working towards the e - filing system for grant of forest clearance . 
This is a good beginning to bring technology in the management of forests . 
I would like to see the extensive use of technology in conservation , mapping and governance of the forests in the country . 
India has announced its domestic mitigation goal of reducing emissions intensity of GDP by 20–25 per cent by 2020 compared with 2005 . 
We also have the challenge of promoting rapid economic growth to meet the challenges of poverty and unemployment . 
To achieve the rapid economic growth with our commitment , we need to focus on low carbon inclusive growth strategy . 
This is where I see you all playing an important role to see India emerging as a ‘low carbon economy’ through innovative forest management and community participation programmes . 
Being a Forester , your task is not easy one . 
The challenges before you are complex and the expectations from you will always be very high . 
Vast areas of this country need to be afforested . 
The various services and goods provided by the forests , such as clean water and air , Biodiversity values , soil and water conservation need to be enhanced . 
Satisfying all these requirements is not an easy task and will require not only the skills and knowledge you will learn during the training , but also the use of modern technology to bring about such a change . 
However with the hard work , determination and commitment towards your work , I am sure , you will be able to fulfill the hopes and trust , the country has reposed in you . 
Before I conclude , I will request you to continue with the journey of learning . 
You must keep abreast with the changing international and domestic forest management issues and adopt the best practices in your profession . 
I will like you to remember what Gandhiji had said , " Live as if you were to die tomorrow , learn as if you were to live forever . ”
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE TO THE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS ON THE TOPIC , “DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE”
Leaders of institutions of higher learning ; Heads of other academic and research institutions ; faculty members ; my dear students : 
I am happy to address you at the beginning of this new academic session . 
I welcome all the students who have joined universities and other centres of higher learning for the first time . During the Annual Conference of Vice Chancellors of central universities held in the Rashtrapati Bhavan in February 2013 , it was decided that I will have e - interaction with academic institutions twice a year - once in the beginning of the calendar year and again in August , on commencement of the academic year . 
I first interacted through this e - platform in January , 2014 . 
I express my gratitude to Prof . S . V . Raghavan and his team at the National Knowledge Network , and the NIC team , for making this video - talk possible . 
You , the youth of our country , are our future . 
You have a stake in the progress of this nation and the welfare of its people . 
General Elections to the 16thLok Sabha were held in April and May , this year . 
Election is a great festival of democracy and a crucial milestone in a nation’s journey towards peace , progress and prosperity . 
Many amongst you have voted for the first time in the elections this year . 
That how deep the roots of our democracy are can be gauged from the fact that from a level of about 58 per cent in both the 2004 and 2009 General Elections , the voter turnout has gone up to an encouraging 66 per cent in this year’s Elections . 
I compliment you for your enthusiastic participation in this largest democratic exercise of the world . 
This Election has provided majority to a single party for the formation of a stable government after thirty years , with a mandate to provide good governance . 
Good governance is a mechanism to establish order , pursue social and economic progress and promote welfare of the people . 
As developing countries grapple with a multitude of socio - economic objectives , standards of governance have come into sharp focus in recent years . 
In this backdrop , I have chosen to speak to you today on an issue of contemporary relevance - Democracy and Governance . 
Though good governance entered the lexicon of development two decades back , its essentials were prevalent in India since ancient times . 
In Arthshastra , Kautilya had described the qualities of a King as : 
The happiness of the people is the happiness of the king ; their good alone is his , his personal good is not his true good ; the only true good being that of his people . 
Therefore let the King be active in working for the prosperity and welfare of his people . 
On the eve of India’s independence , Pandit Nehru in his ‘tryst with destiny’ speech outlined the aim of a free India as the ending of poverty , ignorance , disease and inequality of opportunities . 
It was evident that political freedom would carry little meaning without social and economic justice . 
At the time of Independence , we the people of India chose democracy as the form of government . 
Our democratic ideals flow from the Constitution , which reflects our civilizational values . 
The Preamble , the Fundamental Rights , the Fundamental Duties and the Directive Principles of State Policy contain the ingredients of good governance . 
In the Preamble , we resolved to constitute India into a sovereign socialist secular democratic republic and to secure to all its citizens : 
Justice , social , economic and political ; Liberty of thought , expression , belief , faith and worship ; Equality of status and of opportunity , and to promote among them all ; and Fraternity , assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation . 
Fundamental rights are essential to preserve human dignity . 
Human dignity cannot be assured without the elimination of poverty . 
The Directive Principles are an essential guide to good governance practices . 
Only good governance can eradicate deprivation and backwardness . 
In the landmark judgment in the case of Kesavananda Bharati vs . State of Kerala in 1973 , the Supreme Court observed that both Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights are equally ‘fundamental’ . 
The Constitution has given us the three pillars of democracy - Parliament , Executive and Judiciary . 
The provision of freedom of speech and expression has given rise to a powerful and vigilant media . 
In India , I see good governance as exercise of power , within the framework of the Constitution , for efficient and effective management of our economic and social resources for the well - being of the people , through the institutions of state . 
Our Constitution is a living document which has evolved with time and within its spacious provisions accommodated the changing needs of a growing democracy . 
It is a constant reminder of our civilizational values , which we at times tend to forget . 
We will do well to remind ourselves , at least occasionally , that these values are sacrosanct in the functioning of our democracy . 
Good governance is not a given in any system . 
It has to be nurtured by carefully developing institutions of democracy . 
Distortions happen when one institution does not function in the manner expected of it leading to overreach by others . 
What is required then is strengthening , re - invigorating and re - inventing these institutions to meet the needs of the time . 
It calls for wider involvement of the civil society . 
It entails free and open participation in the political processes by the people . 
It calls for ever - increasing engagement of the youth in the institutions and processes of democracy . 
It calls for ethical and responsible behaviour from the media . 
Good governance is critically dependent on pre - requisites like inviolable adherence to rule of law , existence of participatory decision - making structure , responsiveness , transparency , accountability , corruption - free society , equity and inclusiveness . 
In short , good governance implies a framework that has well - being of the people as its focal point . 
Progressive legislations provide an enabling environment and empower citizens to access entitlements . 
Some examples are the right to Information , education , food and employment . 
Novel legislations can work only with robust delivery mechanisms . 
Corruption leads to denial of equitable distribution of benefits . 
Complexity and opacity of rules and procedures , discretion in the exercise of power , and weak enforcement of legal provisions are factors contributing to corruption . 
While we might need some new institutions to fight corruption , the solution lies not merely in creating more institutions but in strengthening and reforming the existing institutions to deliver results . 
Good governance calls for adequate decentralization of power . 
Panchayati Raj institutions need financial autonomy and administrative ability . 
Reforms in this third tier of governance are necessary for sharing of real power with the people . 
Governance implies involving the civil society as an equal collaborator . 
One must therefore be conscious of her duties and responsibilities , besides rights . Intolerance and acrimony in public discourse has to be avoided . 
Our country needs constructive partners rather than privilege seekers . 
I call upon you to contribute to a healthy democratic society and good governance practices in all spheres of functioning . 
Dr . S . Radhakrishnan had once said and I quote : 
All education is , on the one side , a search for truth ; on the other side , it is a pursuit of social betterment . 
You may discover truth but you should apply it to improve the status of society . 
A sound education system is the bedrock of an enlightened society . 
Our institutes of higher learning are the cradle of future administrators and policy makers . 
The seeds of progressive thinking have to be sown and nurtured here . 
The core civilizational values of love for motherland ; performance of duty ; compassion for all ; tolerance for pluralism ; respect for women ; honesty in life ; self - restraint in conduct , responsibility in action and discipline have to be inculcated in these institutions . 
A democracy cannot be healthy without informed participation . 
You , dear students , are amongst the brightest young minds in this country . 
The society has invested in you , and in return , you owe something to the society . 
You are entrusted with the people’s hopes and expectations . 
Read , learn and formulate views on national issues . 
Make the governance of this country your passion . 
Choose to engage with our beautiful but sometimes noisy democracy . 
As the future practitioners of governance , you have to play an active and positive role in ensuring that these institutions perform their duties with responsibility . 
In the context of our democracy , good governance is a reflection of the successful functioning of the institutions of state with the singular intention of the well - being of citizens at heart . 
With these words , I conclude . I now leave the floor for a few questions . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE CALL ON BY PROBATIONERS OF INDIAN FOREST SERVICE 203 - 15 BATCH

SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE TWELFTH ANNUAL CONVOCATION OF NALSAR UNIVERSITY OF LAW
I am delighted to be here this evening for the twelfth annual convocation of NALSAR University of Law which has , in a short span of sixteen years , emerged as a leading destination for legal education in our country
Its graduates have made a mark in almost all facets of the legal profession . They have excelled in litigation , judicial services , teaching , research , social advocacy , international organizations and transactional lawyering . 
NALSAR stands tall amongst the National Law Universities that have revolutionized legal education in India and helped the prestige of the legal profession . 
Consequently , the legal profession today attracts the best and the brightest like medicine and engineering did in the yesteryears . 
This is indeed a welcome transformation as the importance of the legal profession in a democratic country cannot be exaggerated . 
Lawyers play a vital role in ensuring the public access to justice and making our Constitution a living reality . 
In any society where the rule of law prevails , the legal profession is regarded a noble profession and some of the most prominent leaders of India have been lawyers . 
Mahatma Gandhi and Pt . Jawahar Lal Nehru were lawyers . 
It is important to recognize that the training our leaders received as lawyers in both India and abroad played a major role in our unique national movement . 
Our independence struggle sought to wrest from the colonial power , basic rights and democracy in a peaceful and non - violent manner using reason , argument , and moral courage all of which are important tools of a good lawyer . 
Legal education has undergone a paradigm shift in the last two decades . 
Yet there are many areas that require further strengthening . 
Our educational institutions imparting law education have to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application . 
They have to ignite inquiry and encourage curiosity . 
The study of legal system cannot be pursued in isolation from the wider socio - economic realities . 
Even as law students become more adept in interpreting legislative enactments and reading judicial opinions , they must do so within the liberal framework . 
The shadows of our colonial past continue to play a predominant role in our thinking in relation to the enforcement of rules as well as adjudication of disputes . 
It is important to gradually rework the underlying principles to make administration of justice more representative and responsive to the citizens . 
Lawyers are in a unique position to play this transformative role , be it through offering of inputs in the framing of legislations , leading cause - oriented litigations and engaging in social advocacy or research . 
Legal education should , therefore , be seen by students and practitioners much beyond than a means of livelihood . 
It must encourage them to constantly think about how their actions will affect the common man . 
Along with proficiency in the traditionally identified skills of legal reasoning , research and writing , students must be encouraged to attach utmost importance to the enduring principles of equality , liberty , fraternity with unflinching support for social justice . 
The framers of our Constitution gave us a rich and varied text which speaks about these ideals . 
They incorporated several provisions in the Constitution to address the social , economic and political problems of the nation . 
Abolition of untouchability , prohibition of hereditary titles and the guarantee of fundamental rights are a few notable examples . 
Despite our best efforts , some of these social evils continue to survive . 
It calls for urgent attention of the policy - makers as well as those in the legal profession . 
The framers also left us with some enduring principles which continue to shape our thinking . 
Late Granville Austin , the noted historian of the Indian Constitution , described it as a ‘seamless web’ which weaved together the three distinctive strands of national integration , building democracy and ushering in a social revolution . 
As keen students of Constitutional Law , I need to hardly emphasize to you that a meaningful study of this subject is possible only if one engages in moral reasoning and debates about the true meaning of these strands . 
It is my hope that our leading law schools are encouraging their students to not merely learn the content of laws but to also assess their rationale , the consequences of their implementation and constructive suggestions for their reform . 
In the interest of ensuring quality education , there is usually a push towards standardization . 
Yet , there is need for experiments in higher education . 
Very often , it is the willingness on the part of a few to take a leap of faith to introduce changes . 
I am happy to learn that NALSAR in the last two years has made conscious efforts to diversify its curriculum by offering more elective courses , giving students greater academic flexibility . 
NALSAR is a one - of - its - kind law university in the country which has choice - based credit policy in the true sense . 
The university is also focusing on post - graduate programmes to attract students with training in different disciplines . 
NALSAR has introduced unique MBA programmes in Court Management and Innovation & Sustainability Management besides offering post - graduate degrees in Aviation and Telecommunication Laws . 
I have also been given to understand that NALSAR is planning to launch a new three - year LL . B . course . 
Going forward , the challenge for this institution will be to produce high - quality research papers that are accepted by internationally recognized peer - reviewed journals . 
The objective of research should be the creation and preservation of knowledge and the evolution of new ideas . 
Such efforts require the determined effort of researchers and the sustained support of administrators and governing bodies . 
I congratulate you all on your remarkable success . 
You would soon join different branches of the legal profession like corporate law , judicial services amongst others . 
Each of them would be rewarding in their own ways . 
But remember , whatever branch of law you may chose , the bedrock of your success should be erected on your unflinching defence of fundamental rights of all , civil liberties and the realization of the rights of the marginalized communities . 
Dedicate yourself to the lofty ideals of selfless public service . 
Attain the highest standards in terms of professional skills and be daring in your fight against injustice irrespective of the financial reward that you receive . 
NALSAR thrives to produce socially relevant lawyers . 
You have to live up to the ideals and goals that your university stands for . 
I recall a famous statement made by three judges of the United States Supreme Court , Justices O’Conor , Scalia J . , and Rehnquist C . J . : 
One distinguishing feature of any profession , unlike other occupation that may be equally respectable , is that membership entails an ethical obligation to temper one’s selfish pursuit of economic success by adhering to standards of conduct that could not be enforced either through legal fiat or through discipline of the market . 
There are sound reasons to continue pursuing goal that is implicit in the traditional view of professional life . 
Both the special privileges incident to membership in the profession and the advantage those privileges give in the necessary task of earning a living is means to a goal that transcends in accumulation of wealth . 
Gaining financial security and meeting other obligations are necessary . 
Yet , while pursuing your professional goals , always keep in mind the values that you have imbibed during the course of your education . 
Irrespective of your chosen branch of law , apply these values to them . 
Your actions will shape the lives and prospects of those who rely on your professional expertise . 
Study the Constitution well . Understand our political system , its institutions and processes . 
Analyze the choices that were made to build the country into what it is today . 
Recognize that intelligent choices will need to be made for enabling this country reach its maximum potential and participate and contribute in making these choices . 
At the conclusion of your formal education today , you step into a world where you would need to learn more . 
Continue learning throughout your professional life and accept new ideas . 
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes had said : 
" The best part of our knowledge is that which teaches us where knowledge leaves off and ignorance begins”
I wish all of you a successful career and a fulfilling life ahead . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NATURAL FIBRES
It is indeed a happy occasion for me this evening to participate in the inauguration of the International Conference on Natural Fibres , which has been organized to mark the conclusion of the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of the National Institute of Research on Jute and Allied Fibre Technology ( NIR - JAFT ) . 
This Institute , which is one of the constituents of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research , is dedicated to the development of jute and allied fibres technology . 
In a changing world economic and environmental scenario , there is a need to evaluate the role of jute and allied fibres . 
A conference of this nature is therefore timely and I compliment NIR - JAFT and the other collaborators – National Jute Board , Indian Natural Fibre Society and Central Research Institute for Jute and Allied Fibres – for convening it . 
I am glad to have the opportunity to share some of my perceptions with this distinguished gathering of experts on jute and allied fibres , researchers , policy makers and entrepreneurs . 
Jute is an important agricultural fibre crop in Eastern India . 
Till the Seventies , it was an important commodity for exports and was rightly named ‘golden fibre’ . 
India is currently the largest producer of raw jute fibres and jute products in the world . 
Industrial production of jute goods comprises mainly packaging materials , sacking and hessian , which account for 82 percent of the total production . 
Unfortunately , there has been a lack of growth orientation in the jute industry during the last few decades . 
In the face of stiff competition from substitutes , mainly synthetics , it has gradually lost its prime position as a packaging material . 
A host of reasons have led to the disquieting trends in this industry . 
Absence of up - gradation and modernization ; over dependence on Government’s order for mandatory use of sacking bags ; stagnant productivity levels ; limited scope for value - addition of sacking and hessian ; seasonal fluctuations in supply and price of raw jute ; gradual decline in production of raw jute of superior grades ; imbalance in price structure of jute goods , and inadequate demand at international level have adversely affected the jute sector . 
Adding to its woes is inadequate availability of machinery for increased productivity and quality assurance ; industry apathy for technology absorption and product diversification ; and insufficient export promotion and marketing strategy . 
A concerted effort by all stakeholders is necessary to develop the jute sector . 
Serious attempts have to be made to transform the image of jute products from cheap packaging material to value - added products suitable for diversified end - uses . 
The global concern for environment and increasing consumer preference for bio - degradable natural fibre products have opened a window of opportunity for enhanced use of jute . 
To realize this potential , technical capabilities have to be boosted through greater investment , technological up - gradation , market promotion and facilitatory government role . 
The National Fibre Policy 2010 aims at transforming the jute sector from a traditional labour - intensive industry to a self - reliant modern industry with state - of - the - art technology and wider product range . 
The Jute Technology Mission is expected to help the growth of jute - diversified products , especially in the export market . 
Jute agriculture in general and post - harvest technology in particular needs special attention in terms of technology support and extension activities . 
Improvement in fibre yield , and production of fine fibre with improved strength , colour and luster and devoid of defects that arise on account of faulty retting , will ensure remunerative return to the jute farmers . 
Jute is compatible with the requirements of a clean environment . 
t is pertinent that it continues to be the preferred choice as a packaging material for food grains and sugar . 
However , steps are required to be taken to cut down its cost of production . 
For this , improved machinery has to be developed and measures for energy and waste management adopted . 
The manufacturing and quality assurance processes have to be up - graded . 
To cope with competition from other packaging materials like lighter synthetic bags , greater diversification is necessary to manufacture jute bags of varied types . 
For instance , production and promotion of hydrocarbon - free jute bag could cater to a large domestic market , besides meeting its export demand . 
I am aware of some useful product innovations in the manufacture of jute - based shopping bags , footwear and handicrafts for use by the common man . 
I am told that the consumer response to these items has been encouraging . 
Jute shopping bags having assured quality has been received well in the developed markets of US and Europe . 
I look forward to the development of more such jute - diversified products , which are of daily use and good aesthetic value . 
I am confident that such products will find a ready market in India and abroad . 
A large manufacturing base for these items can be established in the Eastern region as well as in other parts of the country . 
It is heartening to note that jute is gradually making in - roads in some areas of Technical Textiles , including geo - textiles and composites . 
In the field of construction , geo - textiles have established their merit in combating geo - technical problems . 
Jute has to find its rightful place in this growing field . 
For that , we must have the technical and manufacturing wherewithal to make varied geo - jute products that can find good market within the country and abroad . 
I hope that the outcome of the International Project on Jute Geo - textiles , being conducted in India and Bangladesh , will establish the efficacy of geo - jute application for enhanced rural road performance , protection of river bank and stabilization of hill slope . 
Similarly , I envisage the use of jute in manufacturing composite materials , suitable for specific applications in automobiles and construction , to prove its benefit in terms of cost - performance ratio . 
Many natural fibres allied to jute like Ramie , Coir , Sisal , Banana fibre and Pineapple fibre are available in our country . 
They all hold immense potential in manufacturing useful products . 
What is required is the judicious development of appropriate process technologies . 
This will pave the way for economic benefits to accrue to farmers and small entrepreneurs dealing with these fibres . 
There is need for sharing of knowledge and experience about different natural fibres and their products . 
The Indian Natural Fibre Society , which was launched two years ago , provides a platform to scientists , professionals and other stakeholders for promoting a scientific spirit towards the growth of natural fibres , in particular jute . 
This International Conference on Natural Fibres , with focus on jute and allied fibres , is a right step forward for an understanding of the potential of these natural fibres . 
I am sure this forum will address all concerns to ensure greater use of these eco - fibres . 
The coming - together of different stakeholders associated with natural fibres will help identify the scope and strategy for purposeful utilization of our natural fibre resources , including jute . 
I am certain that this conference will lead to fruitful discussions , healthy exchange of ideas and concrete action plans for the future . 
I wish the organizers a successful conduct of this Conference . I also wish them good luck for the future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE GOLDEN JUBILEE CONVOCATION OF PT . RAVISHANKAR SHUKLA UNIVERSITY
I am glad to use this opportunity to once again visit Chhattisgarh , a place steeped in history , culture and heritage . 
It is considered the land of Kaushalya , mother of Lord Ram , and the Tapo - bhumi of Valmiki . 
The 800 year rule by the Kalchuri dynasty left an important legacy – the panchayati raj system , which is one of the oldest in the country . 
Swami Vivekananda stayed at Raipur for many years during his childhood . 
Mahatma Gandhi came to Chhattisgarh to acknowledge the participation of its nationalists in the freedom struggle . 
Sant Kabir and Guru Baba Ghasidas , the two saints renowned for their deep spiritual wisdom , have a large following here . 
The rich demographic profile of Chhattisgarh – almost a third of its population comprise the tribals , including some primitive tribes – has garnered the interest of anthropologists from far and wide . Chhattisgarh is blessed with nature’s bounty . 
It has a green cover of 41 percent and rich mineral deposits of iron ore , aluminium , bauxite , tin and coal . 
After its formation in 2000 , Chhattisgarh has emerged as one of the fast developing states . 
It holds promise for greater all - round development in the future . 
Pt . Ravishankar Shukla University is one of the oldest and largest universities of Chhattisgarh . 
It was formed in 1964 , when this State was a part of Madhya Pradesh . 
Named after the first Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh , it started functioning with 34 affiliated colleges . 
One of the first buildings to be constructed was the Library , which is named after Pt . Sundarlal Sharma , the well - known freedom fighter and social reformer of this region . 
This university introduced the semester system way back in 1968 . 
It made extra - curricular activities an important part of the student’s development programme . 
It is a matter of great satisfaction that from a humble beginning , it has made tremendous progress to be a proud higher academic repository today . 
It has 27 departments , 237 affiliated colleges spread over ten districts , and more than two lakh students . 
I congratulate all those – past and present – associated with this institution . 
A university , which is at the apex of formal education system , has a special position in society . 
It is a hallowed place for the churning of knowledge and the moulding of minds . 
A university , and its teachers , carries a great responsibility to prepare individuals who are complete in all respects . 
I look upon centres of higher learning as the guiding light , not only for students , but for the society as a whole . 
They have to instill a belief system that is rooted in our universal wisdom and philosophy . 
Having a modern outlook does not imply deviating from the core values and philosophies of the yore . 
Our civilizational values – love for motherland ; performance of duty ; compassion for all ; tolerance for pluralism ; respect for women ; honesty in life ; self - restraint in conduct , responsibility in action and discipline – are true regardless of time and place . 
They have transcended epochs . It is the duty of our universities to pass the baton of ‘foundational values’ onto the next generation . 
Convocation is an eventful day in your life . 
It holds immense significance for you and for all those – your parents , teachers , relatives and friends – who have a stake in your success . 
You have all along dreamt to see this day . 
Now , you have got wings to chase your dreams . 
As you leave your alma mater today , be assured that your education has made you capable of enjoying a comfortable life and also prepared you to face the rough weather . 
As informed citizens and bright young minds , you must not only be aware of your rights but your duties and responsibilities as well . 
Spare a thought for your less endowed brethren who did not have the opportunity to partake in the benefits of education . 
You have a duty to work towards their upliftment . 
You must harmonize your personal goals and societal commitments . 
It is possible to conciliate between the two . 
For that , you must be driven by a sense of obligation towards your country . 
I am confident that you will make good use of the education you have received here . 
Remember the words of Swami Vivekananda , which I now quote : 
" All power is within you ; you can do anything and everything ; believe in that , do not believe that you are weak”
One of the fundamental duties of an Indian citizen enshrined in our Constitution is " to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement” . 
To enable the ingenuity and industry of young Indians to spur national progress , we require a sound education system . 
Though we can boast of a vast higher education network of over 720 degree - awarding institutions and 37 , 000 colleges , standards in many of them leave much to be desired . 
In the distant past , universities like Nalanda and Takshashila were global leaders in higher education . 
The story is different today . 
As per reputed agencies , there is not a single Indian institution amongst the top 200 universities in the world . 
A country like India , having the largest young population in the world , must be better equipped in preparing human resource . 
A culture of excellence must be promoted in our higher academic institutions . 
Core competencies must be nurtured . 
Academic cooperation between institutions must be encouraged . 
Research must be of a high order and prioritized keeping in mind local issues as well as fields of specialization . 
Institutional mechanisms like innovation clubs must be created to unearth and support potential grassroots innovation . 
Teaching must be top - grade and facilitated by attracting and retaining talent ; hiring experts from industry , laboratories and research institutions ; professional development of faculty ; and laying industry - focus in the academic curricula of professional courses . 
Quality up - gradation of state - level institutions , which account for 96 percent of the higher education capacity , must be accorded high priority . 
The Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan ( RUSA ) is an important initiative in this direction . 
Colleges deserve special attention as a large chunk of students - about 87 percent - are enrolled in them . 
The affiliating universities must guide them to maintain high standards in curricula and evaluation . 
Expansion in the number of academic institutions has led to a gradual increase in the gross enrolment ratio during the last few years . 
Yet , at 18 per cent , it is less than most developed countries , and even Russia , Brazil and China . 
Owing to various factors , many bright students in our country are still denied the opportunity to acquire higher education . 
Greater affordability and enhanced accessibility is the key . 
These will result in greater inclusivity in higher education . 
Meritorious students from difficult economic backgrounds must be assisted through scholarships , student loans and self - help schemes . 
To improve access , ICT solutions must be applied in our institutions . 
Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) help bridge distances to provide education to students located far away from urban centres . 
ICT networks like the National Knowledge Network ( NKN ) facilitates knowledge diffusion through sharing of lectures and course material . 
It enables intellectual collaboration by encouraging experts separated by geography to interact . 
I am pleased to know that this University is already on NKN since 2010 . 11 . 
With these words , I conclude . 
I once again wish all of you on this august occasion . 
May you all excel in life . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE GOLDEN JUBILEE OF NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ( NIT ) 
It is my privilege to be here today for the inauguration of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of National Institute of Technology ( NIT ) , Tiruchirappalli . 
I congratulate everyone associated with this premier centre of technical education on this beautiful occasion . 
I am also glad to have made use of this opportunity to visit Tiruchirappalli , which is a historical city famous for engineering marvels . 
The Grand Anicut , or the Kallanai dam , built across the Kaveri River by the Chola King , Karikala Chola , in the Second Century AD , is considered the oldest water regulatory structure in the world . 
The temple complex at Tanjavur is one of the largest in the country - its apex , the Kumbam , carved out of a single granite rock weighing 90 tonne is another engineering feat . 
Traditional idol - making at Swamimalai , which developed two thousand years ago , is the basis for investment casting technology , now adopted for advanced gas turbine engines . 
Tiruchirappalli is a bustling industrial destination today , marked by the presence of important engineering establishments like Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited , Ordnance Factory , mechanical workshop of the Indian Railways and number of ancillary industries . 
NIT Tiruchirappalli is one of the top technical schools and one of the largest suppliers of engineers in our country . 
Formerly called Regional Engineering College , it was started in 1964 . 
Its first Principal , Professor P . S . Manisundaram , was a visionary who nurtured this College from scratch . 
Tracing the origins of the older NITs like yours , one can draw a parallel with the genesis of post - 1947 modern industrial India , when steel plants , refineries , dams and heavy engineering industries were being set up . 
Most of these NITs were established in rural locations or in green - field industrial sites , with the aim to spur local development . 
Your Institute , which was set up alongside BHEL , was one of them . 
Such vision brought about a pulsating eco - system of industry and technical institution that fostered close interaction . 
The NITs have made remarkable progress over the years . 
That their growth since inception is primarily the result of indigenous efforts , without help from foreign institutions , is truly praiseworthy . 
Another notable feature of the NIT system is its student mix , which by design has a national character , making each campus a microcosmic - Bharat . 
The bright young minds – the would - be engineers and scientists - are an asset to the nation . 
Hopes and expectations from them are many . 
I am confident that the students , including those of this institute , will understand their responsibilities well . 
They will always , with a sense of obligation , perform their duty for the well - being of their fellow countrymen and development of the nation . 
The IITs and NITs are the front - ranking institutions for engineering education in India . 
Yet , according to prominent international surveys on universities , Indian institutions do not figure in the top two hundred places . 
Since September 2012 , I have been expressing my worry about our performance and restating in all my interactions with higher educational institutions the need to take the rating process seriously . 
It is therefore encouraging to see international rating agencies starting to recognize the quality of our institutes . 
Some of our IITs are in the top 50 in civil and electrical engineering . 
Five institutions are amongst the top 20 universities amongst BRICS nations . 
The number of Indian institutions in the top 100 in Asia has increased to 10 this year from 3 in 2013 . 
I am confident that our institutes would replicate these initial successes in the overall rankings . 
The NITs , in particular your Institute , should take a cue from successful Indian institutions on how to approach the rating system . 
Featuring in international rankings has several positive spin - offs , in terms of intangibles like boosting the spirits of students and faculty , to more tangible benefits like better placement for students . 
More importantly , active participation in rankings will propel the development of institutions in the right direction . 
India has recently become a permanent member of the Washington Accord , which is an international accreditation agreement amongst 17 countries for professional engineering degrees . 
I appreciate the efforts of all involved , including this Institute , in taking India into this privileged academic group . 
India’s entry will enable global recognition of our degrees and increase the mobility of our engineers . 
It will enjoin our technical schools to adhere to global benchmarks in quality . 
This will be the real test . 
To identify the challenges facing NITs and work out strategies , a Conference of the Directors of NITs was organized in Rashtrapati Bhavan last year . 
I am hopeful of the suggestions made at the Conference being implemented in a time - bound manner . 
To address faculty shortage , vacant faculty positions must be filled up on priority and external talent injected by hiring experts from industry , laboratories and foreign universities on short - term basis . 
Academic curricula must have an industry - focus . 
Industry interface cell must be set up to establish linkages with the local industry and industry associations . 
ICT networks must be utilized fully to enable knowledge sharing and intellectual collaboration beyond the campus . 
Academic cooperation is a must for healthy exchange of ideas and expansion of knowledge boundaries . 
It is heartening to note NIT Tiruchirappalli having active collaboration with leading global universities that augurs well for students’ prospects . 
Augmentation of student capacity must be facilitated by quick up - gradation of infrastructure . 
E - classrooms must be made available for smarter dissemination of lectures and tutorials . 
I am told that NIT Tiruchirappalli is working on the concept of virtual campus , which if executed will enable greater access to better quality education . 
Knowledge and innovation are the underpinning of progress and prosperity in the twenty - first century . 
In this age of globalization , we can derive competitive advantage only from an eco - system that is conducive to new learning , research and innovation . 
NITs must work towards promoting scientific temper in their students . 
I am glad to learn that this Institute has set up centres of excellence in emerging areas like corrosion and surface engineering , safety , health , energy and environment . 
Using innovation as a bridge , we must muster enough technological prowess to be counted as an advanced nation . 
Yet , given the present socio - economic condition of our country , the thrust of research must be to erase backwardness and wipe out deprivation . 
Innovations must improve the state of the underserved , who want a positive difference in their lives . 
Institutions like yours must support ingenuous ideas that promise betterment for those aspiring to rise up the socio - economic ladder – help a farmer till the soil better , an artisan perfect his craft or a small entrepreneur improve the productivity of his venture . 
I am happy to note that this Institute has a Centre for Rural Technology aimed at developing modern and cost effective technologies for application in the rural areas . 
We pin our hopes on IITs , NITs and other technical institutions to nurture world - class , professionally - competent engineers who will not only take India to new heights in technology but also improve the quality of life of our countrymen . 
We must , therefore , develop in our budding engineers an understanding of the society . 
I am pleased to know that students of this Institute are being exposed to the world outside through initiatives like Joy of Giving that provide service to orphanages and the needy . 
Always remember the words of wisdom of Swami Vivekananda : 
" The education which does not help the common mass of people to equip themselves for the struggle of life , which does not bring out the strength of character , a spirit of philanthropy , and the courage of a lion - - is it worth the name ? ”
I once again wish all of you on this joyous occasion . 
I also wish you all best of luck for the future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE INAUGURATION OF PLATINUM JUBILEE CELEBRATION OF THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING TRIVANDRUM
I am happy to join you for the inauguration of the Platinum Jubilee of the College of Engineering Trivandrum ( CET ) , which is the oldest engineering college in Kerala . 
CET is one of the pioneers in engineering education in the country . Established in 1939 , this institute owes its glory and stature to the vision of the Maharaja of erstwhile Travancore , Balarama Varma ; the support rendered by the state government ; the hard work of the faculty and staff who have served this college since inception ; the unrelenting support of thousands of alumni , and the dedication of the students . 
It is a delight to see this Institute spread over an expanse of 80 acres of lush greenery . 
With four thousand students on its rolls and three hundred faculty members , CET offers eight under - graduate and 23 post - graduate courses , besides doctoral programmes . 
Counted as one of the important engineering institutes in our country , CET has emerged as a shining example of a state government institution achieving national reputation . 
Education has a pivotal role to play in building a nation’s soft power . 
Nelson Mandela had said : 
" Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” . 
History bears testimony to the fact that great nations have progressed on the strength of an able workforce . 
We are pursuing a high growth strategy to make India a front - ranking nation in the world . 
This requires significant contribution from the knowledge sectors . 
One of the crucial academic streams that produce skilled personnel for the economy is engineering . 
It is a field of study which is vital for fulfilling our developmental objectives . 
Our engineering colleges therefore have a key task to produce highly competent engineers and scientists who can become an asset for the profession and the country . 
Engineering is a sought - after discipline and accounts for one fourth of the total enrolment in higher education . 
The annual enrolment in engineering in India tripled during the course of the Eleventh Plan period to 55 lakh at the end of this period . 
A number of engineering colleges have been started in recent years and the capacity of existing ones increased . 
More institutes have also been envisaged in the coming years . 
The acid test before our institutions is to produce a large cadre of scientific and technical manpower without sacrificing standards . 
Our higher academic institutions , including engineering colleges , have some distance to cover in the journey of quality . 
Many meritorious students opt for higher studies abroad . 
We have to retain them by offering world - class education in their own country . 
Unfortunately , superior quality institutions to meet the expectations of bright students are few . 
It is a worrisome indicator that no single engineering institute or a university from India is ranked within the top two hundred universities in the world as per reputed international surveys . 
This is in stark contrast to the higher education sector prevalent in ancient times . 
Seats of learning like Takshashila , Nalanda , Vikramashila , Valabhi , Somapura and Odantapuri had dominated the world higher education system for about eighteen hundred years beginning Sixth Century BC . 
Takshashila was a meeting ground of scholars from four different civilizations – Indian , Chinese , Greek and Persian . 
Efficient management took our ancient universities to great heights before they declined by the Thirteenth Century AD . Today , we languish behind many nations . 
It is possible to reclaim the pre - eminent position but for that all - round changes are required in our educational system . 
Curricular reforms for regular revision and up - gradation of curricula , introduction of choice - based credit system and examination reforms to bring in holistic assessment must take place . 
A culture of excellence must be promoted . One or two departments in which an institute has special capability must be nurtured as Centres of Excellence . 
Formal linkage with the Industry must be established to have regular flow of inputs from industry experts on course curricula and research . 
Engineering programmes must be periodically evaluated based on industry trends . 
The governance structure must facilitate transparent and faster decision - making . 
Alumni must be associated and their experience and expertise utilized for overall development of the institute . 
I am happy to note that the alumni of CET , many of whom are eminent scientists , technocrats and bureaucrats , have a strong network . 
It must be leveraged for the benefit of this institute . 
Being one of the institutions spearheading engineering education , you have an important role in setting benchmarks . 
Intellectual collaboration amongst Indian institutions and with institutions abroad can provide impetus to knowledge generation and sharing . 
Expertise in key areas must be developed by associating with other knowledge - generating institutions . 
In the context of ICT solutions , it is imperative for our institutions to be on existing knowledge networks . 
Recently , India has entered as a permanent member of the Washington Accord , an agreement for engineering degrees between the accreditation bodies of its 17 signatories . 
It will bestow significant benefits , in terms of recognition of Indian engineering degrees abroad and better prospects of Indian engineers . 
The onus is on our engineering colleges to adhere to the requisite accreditation standards . 
Indian institutes must evolve from being a mere teaching institution to a knowledge - creating one . 
For that , research pursuits must be promoted through institutional support mechanisms . 
Research activity of an institute must focus on issues and problems that are peculiar to that region . 
Research must also endeavour to find ways of achieving greater efficiency in utilizing existing resources . 
In the face of increasing resource constraints , growth will be influenced positively by the velocity of technological developments . 
Recognizing this , Governments around the world have made a concerted effort to encourage innovation . 
As for India , we have dedicated the decade 2010 - 20 to innovation . 
The Science , Technology and Innovation ( STI ) Policy 2013 calls for an innovation - led development . 
This policy reflects the need to right - size our research and development system . 
Engineering institutions are a fertile ground for innovation . 
You must work towards making the STI policy a success . 
You must mentor grassroots innovators to develop their ideas into useful products , benefitting the common man . 
I am happy to note the facilities being provided by the Technology Business Incubation Centre and the Centre for Engineering Research and Development at CET towards promoting research and encouraging innovation . 
I am told that a research park within the CET campus is being set up with the aim to propel breakthroughs in engineering science . 
The fact that 30 per cent of students graduating from CET join higher studies and research programmes shows the kind of interest in research that this institute has been able to generate amongst its students . 
It is heartening to learn that papers presented in national and international conferences by the faculty of CET have been recognized for their academic excellence . 
This Institute , in its journey so far , has rendered outstanding education to generations of students . 
It has produced wonderful engineers who have done their alma mater and the country proud . 
Completion of 75 years is an occasion to reflect on what needs to be done to take the legacy of this institution forward and achieve greater success . 
I am sure that the activities being planned as part of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations – conferences , fests , exhibitions and adoption of village – will give enough food for thought for launching the next phase of development . 
I wish all of you a successful conduct of the events . I also wish you all the very best for the future . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT THE FIRST CONVOCATION CENTRAL UNIVERSITY OF KERALA
It is a happy occasion for me to be here today to attend the First Convocation of the Central University of Kerala . 
I am also delighted to visit Kasaragod , located in the Malabar region , which holds great socio - historical significance . 
It was an important centre of commerce during the medieval times , frequented by Arab and European traders . 
During India’s struggle for independence , this region produced prominent freedom fighters like Pazhassi Raja , Kelappaji – known as ‘Kerala Gandhi’ – and K . P . Keshava Menon . 
Despite its glorious past , this region over the years has lagged behind the rest in terms of development . 
To restore its rightful place as a centre of growth befitting its legacy , one of the important initiatives was to establish this Central University in 2009 . 
Flanked by the Western Ghats on one side and the magnificent Malabar Coast on the other , Kasaragod provides a picturesque , tranquil ambience for higher education . 
The Central University of Kerala had braved the initial limitations of infrastructure and support facilities to start its academic activities with two post - graduate programmes . 
It now has six schools , 17 teaching and research departments , over 600 students and 100 faculty members . 
It is commendable that within two years of receiving this permanent site for campus , this institution has succeeded in creating the essential minimum infrastructure to shift five academic departments and the administrative wing . 
I am pleased to name this Campus , ‘Tejaswani Hills’ , after the river in this region , Tejaswini , which literally means radiant . 
This University has also set up a centre at Thiruvananthapuram . 
I compliment the university authorities for quickly responding to the recommendation for establishing centres at state capitals made at the Conference of Vice Chancellor of central universities held in Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2013 . 
I am glad to learn about the proposed expansion of academic programmes at this University . 
A classical language centre has been envisaged . 
With Malayalam attaining classical status in 2013 , I am sure that such a centre will provide a worthy platform for research in various aspects of the local language , literature and culture . 
A School of Medicine and Public Health has also been planned . 
In the context of the unfortunate ‘Endosulphan’ tragedy at Kasaragod , this is a welcome initiative . 
This school should be a platform for higher learning and research in all systems of medicine , with particular emphasis on community healthcare and affordable medical treatment . 
Awarding degrees today to its first batch of students , Central University of Kerala has attained an important landmark in its journey of continuous development . 
It is indeed a moment of pride , joy , satisfaction and fulfilment for the students and this entire university community . 
I congratulate each one of you who has a share in and is deserving of the success of the students . 
Convocation day should be a time for introspection about the purpose of education and its role in the development of the individual and the nation . 
India is an emerging global power . 
Yet , there are many in this country on the periphery of basic needs . 
Success of our nation will lie in mobilizing all the positive forces to fight the scourges of poverty , deprivation and backwardness . 
You enjoy a privileged position by virtue of having access to higher education . 
This privilege comes with a huge moral responsibility . 
Your success will lie in becoming the agent of change – the catalyst in mitigating the hardships and sufferings of the people . 
It is alright to have personal ambitions . 
But it should not be the ‘be all and end all’ in life . 
While pursuing your individual goals , always keep the bigger picture ; the higher calling ; the greater good , in mind . 
Treat your personal aims and the greater good as one integrated whole , without separating them . 
Swami Vivekananda had stressed on the inextricable link between education and altruism , which he said : 
Do you feel for others ? 
If you do , you are growing in oneness . 
If you do not feel for others , you may be the most intellectual giant ever born , but you will be nothing ; you are but dry intellect , and you will remain so . 
Always be the responsible citizens of this great nation and inspiring role models for the future generation . 
If students are the future of this nation , it’s the teacher who shapes them . 
I was a teacher before I came into public life . 
I know how gratifying it is to be a part of this noble profession . 
Our adage of mata pita guru daivam has always placed the teacher on a pedestal . 
The teacher led exemplary lives , worthy of the reverence they received . India needs such teachers in greater numbers today , who are not only dedicated towards teaching and committed to their students but are also driven by a selfless desire to mould the moral fibre of our society . 
We are faced with a scarcity of good teachers in our universities . 
The challenge before us is two - fold – fill up vacant teaching positions , and attract the best talent . 
Innovative measures like appointing eminent resources on short - term basis from research institutions , industry or from abroad have to be adopted to reduce vacancies without dilution of standards
Quality of faculty has to be transformed by providing them encouragement to attend seminars and workshops , undertake collaborative research and contribute to research publications . 
Needless to say , boosting faculty standards is crucial for up - grading our higher education sector . 
Indian universities are absent from the top two hundred ranks in the world as per reputed surveys . 
Though our institutions are placed in higher brackets amongst Asian or BRICS nations , or in some specific disciplines , we are yet to convert these micro developments into macro successes . 
With greater impetus being provided to the ratings process now , I am confident of finding a few Indian institutions amongst the front - ranking universities in one or two years’ time . 
Though newly established universities like yours may not be in the reckoning immediately , you should continue to make progress so that you can soon come up to the level of the leading institutions . 
Academic development has to be through a multi - pronged strategy . 
Modern physical infrastructure like smart classrooms has to be made available . 
ICT networks have to be leveraged for sharing of ideas and knowledge , and academic cooperation . 
E - content through such networks has to be suitably integrated into the regular curriculum . 
A dedicated cell has to be in place to strengthen linkages with the industry . 
Various forms of academia - industry collaboration – endowments and chairs from industry , visiting faculty from industry , joint academia - industry research guides , drafting industry expertise in creating academic programmes and introducing sandwich courses for industry executives – have to be introduced . 
Alumni have to be involved in different capacities – in governance mechanisms , as experts in course design , or as student mentors . 
I am sure alumni of this University will play a fruitful role in its affairs in the times to come . 
Due emphasis has to be laid on research activity . 
To help find solutions to local problems , the focus of research has to be local but its quality should be global . 
The universities have to tend to grassroots innovations by facilitating the conversion of ideas into tangible products . 
In the course of the Vice Chancellors’ Conference this year , I had announced the institution of three Annual Visitor’s Awards for the best University , best innovation and best research . 
I would like all the central universities , including yours , and their faculty and students to strive hard to get recognition . 
I am hopeful of these awards instilling a spirit of competition as well as cooperation amongst the central universities . 
With these words , I conclude . 
I once again wish all of you on this pleasant occasion . I also wish you good luck for your endeavours . 
SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE ON THE OCCASION OF CONFERRING THE GANDHI PEACE PRIZE 2013
It gives me immense pleasure in presenting the Gandhi Peace Prize Award for the year 2013 to Shri Chandi Prasad Bhatt , a life - long Gandhian and devoted and far - sighted modern environmentalist of our time . 
The Gandhi Peace Prize was initiated in 1995 , the 125th year of Gandhiji’s birth . 
The award is an expression of our belief that the ideals that Gandhiji espoused are part of our collective living heritage . 
This heritage is deeply imbued with the idea of being ‘one people . 
It is a celebration of our diversity , our plural culture , our many languages , religions and different modes of life . 
This was the idea that moved those who strove for India’s freedom . 
Our deep and abiding commitment to democracy stems from this idea . 
We continue to be guided by these ideals ; we remain committed to them not because it is our past , but because it is also our future . 
Gandhiji said ‘My Life is My Message” . 
Smt . Indira Gandhi in her foreword to the 90th Volume of the monumental compilation of Gandhiji’s writings The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi , explained the significance of these words . 
She wrote , He was one of those who spoke as he thought and acted as he spoke , one of those few on whom no shadow fell between word and deed . 
His words were deeds , and they built a movement and a nation and changed the lives of countless individuals . 
What is this shadow that Indira Ji spoke of ? It is the shadow of untruth and falsehood . 
Only a person who saw Truth as God could speak of Life itself as a message . 
The recipients of this award in the past include President Julius Nyerere , President Nelson Madela , Vaclav Havel , Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Baba Amte among many others . 
Ramakrishna Mission and Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan are two organisations that have also been conferred this honour . 
Each of these individuals and organisations have through their life and work taken forward the Gandhian ideals of human freedom , compassion for fellow beings and the capacity to be resolutely non - violent and caring in the face of terrible injustice . 
Their work exemplifies the universality of the non - violent action as a mode of attaining a just and equitable society . 
We have gathered today to confer the Gandhi Peace Prize upon Shri Chandi Prasad Bhatt , whose life has also been his message . 
Shri Bhatt’s work embodies a unique love , a love that has long since become universal . 
It is a love of Nature and Nature as encompassing entire creation . 
Shri Bhatt was born into a family of farmers and priests to the Rudranath Temple in Gopeshwar , Uttarakhand . 
Being a hill man , he knew the hardships of his fellow villagers in the backdrop of scarcity of employment , healthcare , lack of infrastructure and education . 
As a true Gandhian and member of the Sarvodaya movement , he realized the need of the time . 
The aspirations of the people inspired him organize the Dashauli Gram Swarajya Sangh in 1964 . 
He dedicated himself through the Sangh to improve the lives of villagers , providing employment near their homes in forest - based industries , and fighting against wrong policies through Gandhian non - violent satyagraha . 
The Chipko movement started by Shri Bhatt in 1973 followed the same method , that is , of peaceful and non - violent Satyagraha for the redressel of the legitimate rights of the hill people to collect wood and fodder and saving them from natural calamities owing to large scale deforestation . 
The Chipko movement was and continues to be a movement of deep love . Love as enacted in the act of hugging trees . 
The Chipko movement was and continues to be a movement of deep love . 
Love as enacted in the act of hugging trees . 
This action meant embracing Nature in all its diversity , bounty and munificence . 
The movement holds in its embrace not only the trees of Shri Bhatt’s beloved Gharwal but all creation across the world . 
It highlights the unique responsibility of protecting creation that has been placed on human beings . 
It is a movement of love against pulverising greed . 
And it is in this sense , Shri Bhatt’s work draws upon the life and thought of Mahatma Gandhi . 
Gandhiji , like Poet Tagore had an abiding concern with Nature and the unique placement of human consciousness in this vast and bafflingly intricate relationship . 
While the Poet sang of its glory and bowed his head on all our behalf . 
Gandhiji placed Love at the heart of his understanding of human –nature relationship . 
Gandhiji said he had no use for economics without ethics . 
This simple injunction created a moral frame within which human ingenuity has to function . 
The limits to human greed have to be defined by inner imperatives and not external constraints . 
This inner imperative that he called beautifully " a small , still voice” is available to all of us , if we cultivate the capability to listen to it and follow its dictates . 
A capacity that Shri Bhatt acquired and demonstrated through practice . 
By placing ethics at the heart of economics , Gandhiji gave us an idea whose significance we have just begun to understand . 
This is the idea of Trusteeship , based on the idea of faith which is a unique human capacity . 
All of us live by and through trust . 
Gandhiji asked us to be Trustees and to have faith in the goodness of our hearts and the hearts of others . 
This goodness would enable us to act as Trustees of what is ours and not ours . 
To be a Trustee is to see Nature as belonging to all creation and those who are yet to come . 
The idea of Trusteeship has been also seen as an idea of re - distributive justice . 
Those with wealth and capability for generating wealth use it for the benefit of others and for society at large to whom also this wealth belongs . 
Shri Bhatt’s movement is one of the finest examples of this idea of Trusteeship . 
Through his work , Shri Bhatt has reminded this nation and the world as a whole that we are responsible for the future as well . 
When we act as Trustees , we act non - violently . 
Ahimsa is not just a method or an instrument . 
It requires recognition of the humanity of others , including the humanity of those we seek to challenge , including the State . 
Ahimsa is based on the idea that others are capable of recognising Truth and acting upon it however misguided or even oppressive they might be . 
Ahimsa is not just non - injury . 
It is an active force that embraces the other , eradicating the differences between I and Thou . 
Poet Tagore and Gandhiji were two modern Indians who recognised the force of such Ahimsa , which frees the unjust and the oppressor from the need and desire to perpetuate injustice and suffering to others . 
Ahimsa deepens freedom and enlarges its scope to include in its ambit , the other . 
Shri Bhatt’s movement showed the way of practising Ahmisa by physically embracing the endangered and the inanimate . 
Shri Bhatt has not only deepened our understanding of responsibility but also provided an object lesson to the world on the power of Ahimsa . 
We in India must always keep in mind that we are the Trustees of the heritage of Mahatma Gandhi . 
As Trustees , it is our sacred duty to preserve , protect and disseminate this heritage , which is truly a legacy of all humanity . 
The Government of India , through the Ministry of Culture has taken two significant and long lasting initiatives in this regard . 
In September last year , the Gandhi Heritage Portal was dedicated to the people of India and the world . 
This is an authentic , comprehensive , open source digital archive of Gandhiji’s writings and the scholarly work around his ideals . 
The Gandhi Heritage Portal uses technology to bring to the world message of Gandhiji . 
The Ministry of Culture also launched a five year mission called the Gandhi Heritage Sites Mission . 
This Mission is mandated with the preservation of the built heritage of Gandhiji’s life . 
It will create an architectural database and provide guidelines for the protection of around 39 crore Sites associated with Gandhiji’s life in South Africa , Bangladesh , England and of course India . 
I am certain these initiatives will prepare the ground for us to renew our commitment to Gandhian ideals as we mark two significant events in the coming years . 
On 9th January 2015 , we will mark 100 years since Gandhiji’s return to India after his long and life altering Satyagraha in South Africa
This would be an occasion for us to celebrate not only Gandhiji but all those Pravasi Bhartiyas , persons of Indian origins who have made significant contributions to their adopted countries as well as mother India . 
In 2019 , we will also mark 150th anniversary of Gandhiji’s birth , which we can truly celebrate by ending the indignity of homes without toilets and making a success of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan announced by the Government to ensure hygiene , waste management and sanitation across the country
Shri Bhatt , in honouring you we honour all those countless women and men who became Trustees of the Nature and who through their embrace expanded our Swaraj . 
I salute you for your dedicated , tireless and invaluable work for the conservation of the environment . 
I also thank you for your immense contribution to our nation and wish you good health as well as long years of continued service to our people . 
EXTRACTS FROM SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA , SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE AT ANNUAL DAY CELEBRATION TO MARK 160 YEARS OF THE CENTRAL PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT ( CPWD ) 
I am happy to join you on this annual day celebration to mark one hundred sixty years of the Central Public Works Department ( CPWD ) . 
I compliment the entire CPWD fraternity of engineers , architects , technical and non - technical staff , and workmen on this joyous occasion . 
The sphere of activity of CPWD is centred not only on big urban areas but also remote places . 
I am told that CPWD has executed works at the Rann of Kutch , Thar Desert , in high altitude areas of the Himalayas , North Eastern Region and also in Afghanistan . 
The projects implemented by it which include green building , city infrastructure , sport facility , educational institution , and residential and office complex are commendable . 
The construction sector is marked by dynamism in terms of concepts , techniques and efficiency parameters . 
Any modern organization operating in this evolving field can ill - afford to ignore the latest developments taking place . 
It is incumbent on organizations like CPWD to possess sound technical pre - requisite to launch initiatives in various infrastructure domains . 
It is for CPWD to adopt state - of - the - art procedures for maintenance of assets . 
It is understandable that old organizations are often burdened with out - dated practices . 
The challenge is therefore to become vibrant and enterprising , and respond quickly to the changing external environment . 
I expect no less from a department of CPWD’s calibre and capability . 
CPWD should evolve into a smarter , more dynamic and highly professional organization . 
It should benchmark itself with the best in the world . 
It should adopt global best practices to be able to orient itself towards efficiency , cost and quality consciousness and on - time performances . 
It should adopt latest management techniques to bring in greater efficiency throughout the system . 
It should go for information technology ( IT ) solutions to attain greater transparency and speed in decision - making . 
With India’s high level of competence in the IT sector , it should not be difficult to achieve synergy between IT initiatives and organizational goals of CPWD . In this context , I applaud the organization for having e - governance as the theme for this year’s annual day celebrations . 
CPWD , as a technical department , should focus on areas where innovation and modernization in the infrastructure sector can lead to accelerated economic development . 
Last mile connectivity of rural roads , health and educational infrastructure , water supply and sanitation are some areas that immediately come to my mind . 
I am sure that the Ministry of Urban Development will provide guidance in this direction . 
CPWD should constantly make efforts at adopting innovative designs and practices for construction . 
In today’s perspective , sustainable habitat is the need of the hour . 
Energy - efficient building is ‘the’ important strategy for sustainable urban development . 
CPWD should build enough capacity within the organization to use latest technology in implementing green building projects . 
At the same time , it should also pay heed to the aesthetics of these new buildings . 
I am confident that CPWD will help improve infrastructure across the country in an efficient and transparent manner and contribute towards sustainable development . 
I expect CPWD to continue serving the country with renewed dedication and commitment in the years to come . 
Remember the words of Mahatma Gandhi who had said : 
Consciously or unconsciously , every one of us does render some service or another . 
If we cultivate the habit of doing this service deliberately , our desire for service will steadily grow stronger , and it will make not only for our own happiness , but that of the world at large . 
I once again wish the CPWD family the very best for the future . 
Speech by the president of india , shri pranab mukherjee at the presentation of national awards , shilp guru awards and sant kabir awards to artisans and weavers for 2011
It is indeed a matter of satisfaction for me to join you today in conferring the prestigious National Awards , Shilpguru Awards and Sant Kabir Awards to outstanding weavers and artisans for the year 2011 . 
I would like to , first of all , congratulate the awardees and express my deep appreciation of their contribution to the preservation and promotion of India’s handloom and handicrafts industry . 
I am confident that their endeavours shall encourage and inspire many . 
Ladies and gentlemen , our indigenous handicrafts and handlooms are a cherished aspect of the Indian way of life . 
Their extensive range reflects our nation’s diversity and infinite creativity . 
Each geographic region - and sub - region even - has its individual style and tradition - that stems from the ancient life - rhythms of its society . 
In every case , local materials and resources are used . 
Our shilpkaars have , down the ages , developed their own - often unique – methods and techniques to bring life into stone , metal , sandalwood and clay . 
They had , a very long time ago , perfected scientific and engineering processes far ahead of their times . 
Their creations revealed their sophisticated knowledge and highly developed aesthetic sense . 
Similarly , the level of artistry and intricacy achieved by our weavers over the years is unparalleled and many traditional weavings remain beyond the capability of modern machines . 
These skills have sustained generations and provided livelihood and stimulated socio - economic development at the very grassroots of our society . 
This sector has contributed substantially to the empowerment of women , the youth and the disabled . 
Women are a large part of the work force in the weaving sector and , women constitute over 50 % of the artisans’ sector . 
A considerable percentage of weavers and artisans belong to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and religious minorities . 
This sector not only provides low investment income opportunities for families in the rural sector but it also supplements their incomes in off - season of Agriculture . 
Vitality in this sector checks migration and helps to keep traditional economic relationships intact . 
It is significant that the handlooms sector in India , with 24 lakh handlooms , provides employment to about 44 lakh persons and our handicrafts sector provides employment to about 70 lakh persons . 
The Textile Sector provides largest employment opportunities next to Agriculture . 
Between 2010 and the present , it is seen that despite the overall slowdown in the Indian economy there was a growth of 34 % in exports from the handlooms sector and 126 % in the exports from the handicrafts sector . 
However , it cannot be ignored that this sector , despite its wide production base , has been constrained in its growth . 
It has been disadvantaged by its inadequate access to credit , dependence on middlemen , inadequate availability of raw material , out - dated technology and limited access to markets . 
The products in this sector remain vulnerable to competition from cheaper imports and machine made substitutes . 
These factors need to be addressed urgently , systematically and comprehensively and we must give more attention to development of capacity , skills , designs and infrastructure . 
It is important to recall that the founding fathers of our nation had recognized the importance of safeguarding handicrafts and handlooms in the long term . 
They had introduced a number of measures to ensure its sustainability including well - conceived initiatives , national - level programmes and supportive legislations . 
I would like to emphasise that it is crucially important for us , today , to do all that we can to honour their dream . 
We must take concerted and collective steps at multiple levels . 
These could include , for example , facilitation of easier access of these sectors to credit from banks and other financial institutions and the promotion of the products of these sectors in domestic and foreign markets . 
I firmly believe that universities , corporate sector and Government departments can contribute by sponsoring - and themselves taking up - research that results in innovative technology to adapt and upgrade the traditional tools and designs of the local artisans , and weavers . 
And there are many factors in our favour . 
The abundant availability of unusual raw materials in India - such as bamboo , horn , jute , a pool of skilled artisans and indigenous knowledge has kept our production costs low . 
Government is working on more enabling policies in the 12th Five Year Plan . 
Many who had left the handloom and handicrafts sector have begun to revert . 
This is a good indication that Governmental interventions so far have been effective . 
It is , however , necessary for all concerned Ministries and Departments to stay vigilant and respond promptly to demand in existing and emerging markets . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , our " guru shishya parampara” is another exceptional aspect of our traditional art and crafts . 
Master - craftsmen and weavers , down the ages , have taken pride in passing on their skill to their succeeding generations . 
Gandhiji had , in fact , a very clear view on this and considered handicrafts to be a vital part of education . 
He had said , if we want to keep all seven lakhs of our villages alive and not only a fraction of them , we have to revive our village handicrafts . 
And you may be sure that if we impart scholastic training through those crafts , we can bring about a revolution” . 
As I leave these thoughts with you , I would like to thank the Ministry of Textiles for instituting these awards . 
I would like to , once again , congratulate the craft persons and weavers who have received awards today . 
I take this opportunity to convey to you - and through you - my felicitations to all the members of the handicrafts and handlooms community in all parts of our nation . 
Speech by the president of india , shri pranab mukherjee at the annual convocation of devi ahilya vishwavidyalaya
It is my pleasure to be here today for the annual convocation of Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya , Indore which is being held in its Golden Jubilee year . 
I congratulate all the students who have received their degrees and medals today . 
Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya established in 1964 as University of Indore , reminds us of the great ruler Devi Ahilyabai Holkar who was a benevolent ruler of Malwa and who commands great respect . 
Association of her name with the University places great responsibility on the University to combine its role in higher education with service to society . 
It is said that India lives in villages . This is particularly true for Madhya Pradesh , a tribal – rural area dominated state , with more than 72 % population living in rural areas . 
The ratio of tribal population to the total population in Madhya Pradesh is about two and a half times of that at the national level . 
Furthermore , there are 40 tribal development blocks out of 54 development blocks in the eight districts of Indore division . 
This implies that challenges of higher education in Madhya Pradesh are higher than those at the national level . 
Adequate interventions in terms of policies , plans and approaches are needed for the education of students drawn from tribal and rural backgrounds , especially to make them globally competent . 
I am glad to know that Devi Ahilya University is serving the educational needs of eight tribal dominated districts . 
Friends , education separates light and darkness ; advancement from backwardness ; excellence from mediocrity . 
If one investment can truly define a subtle linkage to future progress , it is education . 
Countries built on the strength of education and knowledge have achieved development over longer periods of time . 
Such countries have exhibited greater adaptive powers to changes in resource endowments . 
Education has afforded them the ability to overcome resource constraints and build an economy on a high technological base . 
If India has to be one of the front ranking nations in the world , the way ahead is only through a robust education system . 
Accordingly , the Government proposes to set up an Education Commission to draft a new education policy . 
The last modifications to the National Policy on Education was made in 1992 . 
The country has witnessed tremendous changes since 1992 . 
A new , comprehensive National Education Policy is the need of the hour in order to attune education to meet global challenges and address issues of quality , research and innovation as well as capitalise on the " demographic dividend” . 
India has a sizeable number of young people , with two - third of the population below 35 years of age . 
Their proper grooming is essential as they are our future . 
Sadly , enrolment in higher education is below 20 per cent in India . 
Recognizing that this is not enough and may drag down the potential of our future generation , rapid strides have been made to expand the higher education infrastructure in recent years . 
The Government now proposes to establish institutions of national importance such as IITs and IIMs in all the states . 
Yet , if we undertake an honest analysis of the state of higher education in our country today , it is evident that many higher academic institutions lack the quality to produce graduates for the global market . 
I have been sharing my concerns about the performance of Indian institutions in world university rankings during my visits to the universities . 
We must transform our Universities into world class institutions . 
Indian civilization has a long standing knowledge tradition . 
Our ancient universities - Takshashila , Nalanda , Vikramashila , Valabhi , Somapura and Odantapuri – were renowned seats of learning that attracted scholars from outside . 
In fact , for almost 1500 years , from the founding of Takshashila in 3rd century BC to the collapse of Nalanda in 12th Century AD , India was a world leader in the field of higher education . 
We must salvage the declining standards of our country’s higher education as a top priority . 
Our leadership in fields such as science and technology is incumbent on the level of competence in our scientists , scholars , engineers and doctors . 
I am happy to find that our institutions have started to accord due seriousness to the rankings process . 
In September last year , the Finance module of IIM , Calcutta was adjudged by a reputed agency as the best amongst business schools offering the Master of Management programme . 
In the World University Ranking done subject - wise by another reputed agency , two IITs - Madras and Bombay - are amongst the top 50 institutions in civil engineering , while IITs - Delhi and Bombay - are in the top 50 in electrical engineering . 
I want our institutions to build up on these micro - level successes and achieve a much higher overall ranking . 
Friends , faculty is the bedrock of education . 
The quality of teachers determines educational standards . 
Several measures are required for faculty development . 
Vacant teacher positions have to be filled up on priority . 
Talented faculty from abroad must be hired to inject new thinking and diversity in academic approach . 
The Scholar - in - Residence ‘ENCORE’ programme and Faculty Recharge Programme of the UGC should be utilized better . 
Many ills that afflict efficient functioning of our universities stem from the lack of good governance practices . 
Governance structures have to promote faster and transparent decision - making . 
In this context , the induction of reputed alumni into the governance mechanism could provide the dynamism that our institutions are often in short supply of . 
Alumni expertise can also be drafted to review existing courses and introduce new ones . 
A concerted effort has to be made to develop a wide - ranging partnership with industry . 
An institutional arrangement for industry - academia interface is essential to explore the contours of collaboration like sponsorship of research endowments and chairs , and conduct of internship programmes . 
Technology is a knowledge carrier and information disseminator par excellence . 
Knowledge networks facilitate intellectual collaboration . 
They mitigate physical constraints as well . 
Effective use of technology - based media for greater academic exchange is the need of the hour . 
The Government intends to promote launching of Massive Open Online Courses , virtual classrooms and also establish a national E - library . 
It is now over 80 years since an Indian University produced a Nobel Prize winner . 
er . The last person to win the Nobel Prize while working in India was Dr . CV . Raman in 1930 . 
Dr . Amartya Sen , Dr . S . Chandrashekar , Dr . Hargobind Khorana and Dr . Vekataraman Ramakrishnan were all graduates of Indian Universities but obtained their Nobel Prizes while working in US Universities . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , if we have to change the above situation , the neglect of research in our universities must be reversed . 
We must adopt multi - disciplinary approaches in our academic system since most research activity requires the meeting of minds from diverse disciplines . 
In order for students and parents to make informed choices about institutions and courses , objective quality assurance frameworks are also required . 
Assessment and accreditation in higher education , through transparent and informed external review process , are effective means of quality assurance thereby assisting student mobility across institutions , in India and abroad . 
Even though accreditation is mandatory in India , a lot remains to be desired in terms of its implementation . 
It gives me great pleasure to note therefore that Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya has been accredited with grade ‘A’ by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council ( NAAC ) . 
I would also like to mention here that we recently became a member of the Washington Accord , paving the way for India to be included in the global comity of nations and providing opportunities of mobility for our engineering students . 
The Government is also in the process of setting up a National Academic Depository ( NAD ) . 
This will be a national database of academic qualifications for facilitating online verification of academic awards issued by boards and universities . 
This would immensely benefit institutions , students and employers by eliminating the need for persons to approach educational institutions for obtaining authenticated copies or for verification of awards as well as reduce the need for institutions to preserve records related to academic performance of students for long years . 
The system would also eliminate fraudulent practices such as forging of certificates , mark sheets , etc . by facilitating online verification . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , our universities have a duty to create inquisitiveness and promote scientific temper amongst their students . 
Wings should be given to the ingenuous ideas of students and grassroots innovators . 
Novel ideas that can be nurtured into viable products deserve mentoring by Universities . 
An initiative taken in several central universities is the setting up of Innovation Clubs . 
Activities of such clubs must be dovetailed with innovation incubators located in IITs and NITs in the region . 
The engagement of clubs with incubators will help create an ‘innovation web’ , to provide linkage between advanced centres of research and the common man . 
I urge Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya to take the lead in creating such an " innovation club” in Indore . 
Friends , India is on the threshold of new opportunities and higher achievements . 
Assuming global leadership by India is no longer a utopian proposition . You , the educated youth of our country , will build this resurgent new India . 
Use the education you have received here to become change - agents in society . 
Draw inspiration from the words of Mahatma Gandhi who said : 
" Essence of education lies in drawing out the very best that is in you” . 
Always keep in mind the fact that this wonderful education you have received is a contribution of the state and the community . 
The land on which your university stands has been provided by community . 
Similarly , these buildings , the books that fill your library , the online databases etc . come from money that the state has invested in you . 
The nation invests in its universities because students are our future . Students , in turn , have an important responsibility to fulfil , not just to themselves and their families but also to this country and its people . 
A convocation is a red - letter event for any academic institution . 
It is a day when the fruit of years of hard work and perseverance is recognized and celebrated . 
Students , you will leave the hallowed precincts of this university with the armoury of knowledge and strength of character . 
Go to the world outside ; make a difference ; touch and transform the lives of people around you , and create a happier universe . 
Extracts from speech by the president of india , shri pranab mukherjee at the second convocation of the indian institute of science education and research
I am happy to be with you on the occasion of the Second Convocation of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research ( IISER ) , Bhopal . 
This Institute today has awarded its first PhD degree along with graduation and post - graduation degrees to its second batch of students . 
It is a significant milestone for IISER Bhopal , which is a relatively new seat of higher learning in the educational firmament of our country . 
Established in 2008 with 18 students on its rolls , IISER Bhopal has grown rapidly and has now a total of 635 students , including 178 PhD scholars . 
With girls comprising 36 per cent of the student population , it is heartening to see how IISER Bhopal has provided impetus to gender equity in science education and research in the country . 
I am also glad to learn about the efforts being made by this Institute to promote scientific temperament amongst people and to reach out to underprivileged sections of the society . 
Convocation is the single - most important event in a year for any academic institution . 
I congratulate all the students who have received their degrees today . 
It is a moment of reckoning not only for them , but for all those – faculty and staff ; family and friends – who have played a role in their success . 
During the first Annual Convocation of IIT Kharagpur in 1956 , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had said : 
" When I look at the new graduates , I see them launching out not only on their life’s career which is an exciting business for every young man and woman at this time of life , but launching out at a time of peculiar significance to this country… . . It seems to me that at the present moment there is no more exciting place to live in than India” . 
Our country remains as exciting a place to live in and grow with , as it was 58 years ago . India needs capable and committed graduates , more so now , to keep her firmly engaged with the future . 
You have passed out with flying colors and build a strong foundation for a good career . 
You have worked very hard , and you deserve it . 
But you must not rest on your laurels . 
You are entrusted with the hopes and expectations of this nation . 
So , use your education to pursue your dreams . 
At the same time , serve the country ; and what better way to serve , than to help the less fortunate realize their dreams . 
Always stay true to the knowledge you have gained and uphold the values that your alma mater has instilled in you . 
Dream about the endless possibilities for the future ; act on those dreams , and help change the world . 
If there is any investment that can truly fashion a country’s prospects and shape its future generations , it is education . 
And if a country has over half its population aged 25 years or less , which is what India’s position is today , then the significance of a robust education system is undeniably strong . 
The youth of our country is brimming with energy and aspiration . 
They have to be imparted quality education and requisite skills to beat competition and meet success . 
The present educational standards of our institutions could however belie our anticipation of the demographic dividend . 
The quality of higher academic institutions in India is unfortunately below globally - acclaimed institutions . 
Way back in September 2012 , in the Annual Convocation of IIT Kharagpur , I had expressed my sense of dismay on seeing not a single Indian institution finding a place amongst the top 200 universities in the world in international rankings . 
Since then , I have been sharing my concerns about our performance and reiterating in all my interactions with higher educational institutions – be it in Convocations or Annual Conferences in Rashtrapati Bhavan - the need to attach more importance to the rating process . 
The Ministry of Human Resource Development has taken a lot of interest and initiative in this direction . 
It is , therefore , a matter of great satisfaction that reputed international rating agencies , of late , have started to recognize the quality of our institutes . 
In subject - wise world rankings , two IITs - Madras and Bombay - are amongst the top 50 institutions in civil engineering , while IITs - Delhi and Bombay - are in the top 50 in electrical engineering . 
Five institutions are amongst the top 20 universities in BRICS nations . 
The number of Indian institutions in the top 100 in Asia has increased to 10 this year from 3 in 2013 . 
IIT Guwahati is amongst the top 100 institutes aged 50 years or less . 
I am confident that in the overall rankings too , our institutions would soon feature amongst the top 100 or even top 50 in the world . 
The cornerstone of quality up - gradation is promotion of excellence in our academic institutions , with no leniency for mediocrity . 
Teaching must be made a more challenging and gratifying profession to attract bright people . 
Faculty development must be continual given the dynamic nature of conceptual understanding in various disciplines . 
Greater internationalization of the academic community must be attempted through innovative models of faculty and student exchange , visiting chairs and short - term projects . 
The advances in ICT must be employed for intellectual collaboration , sharing of lectures and dispersal of ideas and best practices . 
The governance structure of institutions must facilitate smooth decision - making . 
It must draw wider expertise , including industry experts and prominent alumni . 
The industry - academia linkages in activities like joint research and commissioning of chairs and endowments must be strengthened through institutional mechanisms . 
Science education and research , technology and innovation are crucial underpinnings of progress . 
Yet , there is an apparent neglect of scientific research in our education system . 
This does not augur well for our future growth , which will arise not so much from the utilization of our resources with existing technology than from its better usage through more advanced technology . 
Good education system calls for continuous knowledge creation which can be facilitated only through high quality research . 
It is with this vision that IISERs have been established . 
They have been envisaged as research centres of the highest calibre in which teaching and education in basic sciences integrate totally with state - of - the - art research . 
This amalgamation of science education and research is a novel departure from the higher education model that we follow , where universities are focused mainly on education while laboratories and R & D centres undertake research . 
In this context , the effort of IISER Bhopal to conduct frontier research in collaboration with national and international organizations is a welcome step . 
IISERs must play a central role in attracting more students towards science and converting this fascination into tangible career opportunities . 
They must equip students with sound conceptual understanding and analytical foundation . 
I am happy to learn about the ‘Research Vision Document’ and other initiatives of IISER Bhopal aimed at becoming one of the top institutes in its class within the next twenty years . 
IISER Bhopal must be conscious of the fact that any step taken today is significant as it will determine the kind of institution it will become in the times of come . 
I am confident that this Institute will fully live up to the expectation with which it has been established . 
Let us dream through the prism of posterity . 
I wish you all the very best for the future . 
Speech by the president of india , shri pranab mukherjee at the presentation of national awards for outstanding services in the field of prevention of alcoholism and substance ( drugs ) abuse . 
I am indeed happy to be present amidst you this afternoon on the occasion of presentation of the National Awards for recognizing those who have made an outstanding contribution in the field of Prevention of Alcoholism and Drugs Abuse . 
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the Awardees for the commendable work done by them . 
I also compliment the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment for motivating people to work towards making the society addiction free . 
Alcoholism and drug abuse have become a major social concern . 
Today , the entire world is confronted with this problem in some form or the other . 
With India’s vulnerable geographical position between the two major drug producing zones - - the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent , drug menace continues to spread its tentacles in the country , acquiring ever growing dimensions . 
The society pays a significant cost due to people abusing substances such as drugs and alcohol . 
Illicit drug use is a serious concern since it poses significant health challenges . 
The younger generation is especially vulnerable to the menace , being easily lured to drugs , be it for excitement , curiosity or drug related risk taking behaviour . 
At this age , peer pressure to experiment with illicit drugs can be strong and those taking drugs tend to be either misinformed or insufficiently aware of the health risks involved in it . 
While on the one hand , the use of drugs and alcohol is increasing , on the other hand , we find that social taboos , emphasis on self - restraint , discipline inherent in a joint family system and traditional moorings are eroding . 
Among other factors , the fast changing social milieu arising out of this social and economic transition , which the country is going through , is contributing to the proliferation of drug abuse . 
The introduction of synthetic drugs and intravenous drug use leading to HIV / AIDS has added a new dimension to the issue . 
Drug abuse is not merely a problem arising out of the availability and supply of intoxicating drinks and drugs but has a great deal to do with the social conditions which create the demand for the consumption of such substances . 
The vulnerability of modern society plays a catalytic role in promoting the consumption and abuse of narcotic and psychotropic drugs . 
The harmful use of alcohol can have serious social and economic consequences for individuals , families and society as a whole . 
Drug overdose may even cause death . 
Drug use adversely impacts the entire family and makes it’s members , particularly women and children , extremely vulnerable . 
The family faces stigma , isolation and constriction of resources . 
It is necessary to encourage individuals and families to seek early assistance for problems related to alcoholism and drug abuse . 
There is an urgent need to provide a whole range of community based services for the identification , counselling and de - addiction of addicts along with their after care and rehabilitation . 
Alcoholism and drug abuse is a psycho - social - medical problem requiring a holistic approach . 
The aim of the comprehensive treatment programme should not merely be to get the addicted individuals off alcohol or drugs . 
Focussed attention on making the addicts productive members of the society by making them drug free , crime free and gainfully employed , is what is required . 
In this connection , the importance of skill building and vocational training of drug dependent persons for their effective social and economic reintegration cannot be over emphasised . 
Generating continuous and sustained awareness through innovative methods about the harmful effects of drug abuse also assumes critical importance . 
In December 1987 , the United Nations General Assembly decided to observe 26th June as the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking . 
This was an expression of its determination to strengthen action and cooperation to achieve the goal of an international society free of drug abuse . 
The international campaign by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime also aims at raising awareness of the major problem that illicit drugs pose to society , especially to the young people . 
Acknowledging the importance of having an addiction free society , our Constitution makers had , through the Directive Principles of State Policy made improvement of public health as one of the Government ' s primary duties . 
In particular , it was laid down in Article 47 of our Constitution that the ' State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health’ . 
In order to contain both the supply and demand of drugs , the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act , 1985 was enacted . 
This Act makes stringent provisions for the control of illicit trafficking of drugs and empowers the Government to establish centres for the prevention and treatment of drug addiction . 
Since last year , the Government of India has also started conferring National Awards to institutions and individuals who have made outstanding efforts such as awareness generation , research and rehabilitation to address the problem of alcoholism and drug abuse . 
The institution of these National Awards is indeed a manifestation of the Government’s commitment to address this problem and take effective steps in this direction . 
The Government is also implementing the Scheme of Assistance for Prevention of Alcoholism and Drugs Abuse which aims at providing a whole range of services including awareness generation , identification , treatment and rehabilitation of addicts through de - addiction and rehabilitation centres . 
The Scheme provides for the involvement of NGOs and Community Based Organizations in this regard . 
I hope that these efforts will eventually lead not only in the improvement in public health and reduction of crime but also in the upliftment of the entire social milieu . 
However , much more needs to be done with the active involvement of the entire Civil Society . 
With a view to reducing the demand for the consumption of alcohol and dependence producing substances , the thrust should be on preventive education programmes and on reintegration of the addicts into the mainstream of society . 
The stress should be on mobilization of community resources and greater community participation . 
Apart from this , law enforcement agencies should be sensitized to the needs of victims of substance abuse to enable them to be rehabilitated and reintegrated in the society . 
I urge employers to implement an effective alcohol and drug prevention programme at the workplace . This will also help in increasing their productivity . 
On this Day , let us all join hands together to help people suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction . 
I call upon all stakeholders to strive to address the problem in a holistic and sensitive manner . 
Let us each contribute to prevent and reduce the damage caused by the problem of alcoholism and drug abuse so that we can move further ahead towards a healthier and happier society . 
. I once again congratulate the awardees and convey my appreciation to them for their efforts and achievements . 
I also commend the efforts of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in this direction and wish them all success in their future endeavours . 
Speech by the president of india , shri pranab mukherjee at the third convocation of indian institute of science education and research
I consider it as a privilege to be a part of this Third Convocation of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research ( IISER ) , Pune , which was established in 2006 to augment higher education in science in our country . 
I am glad to have this opportunity to visit this Institute , which is my first to any of the IISERs . 
I congratulate all the students who have graduated today . 
You have received your training from one of the best emerging institutions of India . 
This will have a strong positive impact on your career . 
Having chosen a path of your own fascination , pursue it with passion and seriousness . 
Be creative . Think about doing things in a new and efficient way . 
At the same time , have this realization that as bright young minds , you are capable of contributing so much towards the welfare of society . 
Think about how you can make the world around you a better place . 
Act in a manner that always results in greater good for your fellow beings . 
Your conduct must befit your education and make your alma mater proud . 
Science plays a vital role in the advancement of human life . 
Its study is central to technological progress . 
To prepare our nation to switch to a knowledge - based society , greater emphasis has been laid on science education . 
IISERs are a product of this effort to push the country to the frontiers of scientific knowledge . 
Five IISERs were established with IISERs – Pune and Kolkata – being the first to be set up in 2006 . 
A seat of higher learning must recognize no boundary except those of the human mind itself . 
IISERs have designed themselves as research - led teaching universities . 
They have created a niche for themselves through world - class infrastructure for teaching and frontier research , attracting the best of the faculty , building an eco - system for fundamental and inter - disciplinary research and evolving integrated methods of education . 
In this era of information and communication technology , the distinction between the teacher and taught is vanishing . 
Education is emerging as a process of collaborative learning and teamwork . 
IISERs have made an excellent beginning in teaching of science as it is required for practice . 
Their focus is on nurturing the culture of science through a learner - centric , inquiry - driven teaching , in contrast to the conventional lecture - based teaching . 
IISER Pune , in particular , has made rapid strides during its few years of existence . 
A green campus , modern research facilities and enabling eco - system have nurtured this abode of knowledge where tomorrow’s science begins today . 
I had the good occasion to meet some of the under - graduate and PhD students today who explained to me their projects with a great sense of pride , passion , joy and enthusiasm . 
I also had the opportunity to know about the science outreach programmes of IISER Pune , which is taking science beyond the campus to enable young people to experience the thrill of science . 
I am hopeful that this initiative will ignite the minds of school children and attract them towards science . 
There is boundless energy and initiative amongst the youth of our country . 
To meet their scholastic needs and aspirations , new institutions have been created and the capacity of existing ones expanded . 
This process of boosting the country’s higher education infrastructure must continue unabated . 
Having said that , necessary steps must be taken to ensure that the institutes particularly the ones recently established like IISERs operate at full capacity . 
Scale - up of physical infrastructure must be achieved . 
At the same time , maintenance of educational standards must not be lost sight of . 
I , as the Visitor of about 98 Central level Institutions of higher education , have been meeting with the Vice Chancellors of Central Universities and Directors of NITs . 
Recently , I had interacted with the Directors of IISERs and the Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore , to capture their vision . 
It is our shared understanding that Indian institutions , in order to attain global reckoning , can ill - afford to teach students anything less than contemporary . 
Higher education cannot be rendered on the turf of vintage knowledge . 
It must be driven by newer thinking and innovation . 
Our institutes must imbibe these attributes while preparing the next generation . 
Our higher educational institutions do not match global standards as brought out by international surveys and rating agencies . 
Though subject - wise , a few institutes manage to garner higher rankings - IITs of Madras and Bombay are amongst the top 50 institutions in civil engineering , while IITs of Delhi and Bombay are in the top 50 in electrical engineering – their achievements are mostly peripheral as they are not within the top 200 universities in the world in overall ranking . 
Our country led the world in the field of higher education in ancient times . 
I do not find any reason why today , we cannot occupy our rightful place in the comity of nations when we have excellent faculty and brilliant students . 
Greater internationalization and collaboration with top global institutes , hiring of foreign faculty and drawing of students from abroad must receive sustained focus . 
Centres of Excellence must be built to nurture the core competence of our institutions in select areas . 
Periodic peer review using international benchmarks must be instituted to not only bring international visibility but also understand shortcomings in academic management . 
I am happy to note that IISER Pune has already set up an International Expert Committee to review its performance and suggest future directions . 
Our institutions must never be found wanting in their proclivity for cutting - edge research . 
They must identify and initiate new and frontier research , especially in multi - disciplinary areas in energy , environment and health . 
They must forge collaborations with reputed international institutions , which they can leverage for international research funding . 
They must promote innovation and act as a platform for the flowering of ingenuous ideas in common man . 
They must beat their current inertia and establish productive association with the industry through internships and research projects . 
They must have a dedicated industry - interface cell that can interact with innovation incubators for monetizing ideas and working towards knowledge transfer . 
They must together create an ‘innovation web’ to establish linkage between advanced research centres and grassroots innovators . 
Our institutions and other stakeholders in the educational domain must have the requisite functional systems within them to realize the multiple goals for quality up - gradation . 
This calls for a governance structure in the higher academic institutions that is flexible , monitorable and transparent . 
This will facilitate quick decision - making and enable adequate support for creative pursuits . 
Our country today requires a pool of talented science graduates . 
IISERs must be geared to train students to pursue rewarding careers in science and technology . 
I am delighted to learn about the achievements of IISER Pune in terms of its research publications , scientific collaborations , faculty peer recognitions , research grants and student achievements . 
Its inter - disciplinary approach in faculty organization , research and teaching is commendable . 
I congratulate everyone at IISER Pune for making this possible . I also applaud the management for its clear vision . 
I am confident that IISER Pune would progress to become a top - ranking institute in the times to come and make a difference to science education and research in our country . 
I wish you all success . 
Speech by the president of india , shri pranab mukherjee at the 120th anniversary of swami vivekananda’s historic voyage from mumbai to the west to participate in the parliament of world religions in chicago ( 1893 ) 
It gives me immense pleasure to be here this afternoon . 
Some journeys in the lives of great men are destined to be transformational , both for themselves and for their people . 
So was it with Swami Vivekananda’s voyage to Chicago 120 year ago today . 
As it turned out , the Swami’s Chicago speeches are amongst the greatest proclamations of inter - faith harmony and universal brotherhood in the history of mankind . 
Their relevance has increased manifold today – in a world that is far more inter - connected and inter - dependent . 
Harmonious co - existence among various faiths and communities is not an ideal anymore but an absolute imperative today . 
In his first speech in Chicago on 11th September , 1893 , the Swami had a very significant message - which humanity can ignore only at its peril . 
I like to refer to the following words from his speech : 
Sectarianism , bigotry , and its horrible descendant , fanaticism , have long possessed this beautiful earth . 
They have filled the earth with violence , drenched it often and often with human blood , destroyed civilisation , and sent whole nations to despair . 
Had it not been for these horrible demons , human society would be far more advanced than it is now ? 
Ladies and Gentlemen , in those days , the western world’s understanding of India was coloured by misconceptions about this distant country and her people . 
It was therefore a turning point indeed , when Swami Vivekananda’s powerful thoughts and the purity of his personality won the minds and hearts of a large section of the influential thinkers that he came across . 
As Swamiji unhesitatingly appreciated the positive aspects and accomplishments of the Western Societies – and refrained from being dogmatic as he made his point , he was able to build a robust new bridge of understanding and goodwill for India . 
In so doing , he also opened a new dialogue between our peoples based on mutual acceptance . 
Romain Rolland , French Nobel laureate , in his book The Life of Vivekananda and the Universal Gospel , has written : 
" In two words ‘equilibrium’ and ‘synthesis’ Vivekananda’s constructive genius may be summed up . ……… . He was the personification of the harmony of all Human Energy . ”
As we pay tribute to Swami Vivekananda today , his vision and indeed his own example , should remind us today of the things that we need to do urgently and in a sustained manner – both individually as well as collectively as citizens of modern India . What are the priorities that we could take up ? 
Firstly , social reform constituted a key component of Swami Vivekananda’s vision for modern India . 
Swamiji was uncompromisingly opposed to discrimination , deprivation and injustice on the grounds of caste , class and gender . According to him , the mismatch between the lofty ideals of Vedanta and the disgraceful apathy for the human condition in our society were simply unacceptable . 
Maharashtra has borne some of our nation’s greatest social reformers . 
I would like to affirm today that although the paths of these leaders of our society may have appeared to be outwardly divergent , their goals were essentially the same . 
Swamiji’s 150th birth anniversary celebrations should be an occasion for a constructive debate and cooperative action among the various sections striving for social reform . 
Secondly , as the Swami believed , it is today , an urgent imperative to both improve and also expand our education system . 
I am confident that many of our grand Universities can reinvent themselves and regain their past glory . 
They urgently need to update themselves and make their curriculum and methods more relevant and result oriented . 
This can be achieved through a comprehensive and time - bound plan of reform . 
Further , Government’s efforts must be supplemented by the commitment of more resources by the corporate sector to development and social welfare activities . 
However , I do believe that our foremost goal should be the revival of our proud traditions in morality , ethics and social conduct . 
Our nation’s progress should not be hampered by the tarnishing of our national character or a weakening of the moral fibre of our society . 
As a result , not only is the greater public good being sacrificed , but even the private search for success and happiness is yielding short - lived , illusory and often counter - productive outcomes . 
Therefore , to remember Swami Vivekananda is to remember his call for re - building India’s national character . 
In particular , to remember his epoch - making voyage today is to remember his call to the youth of India to be daring , courageous , adventurous and strong ─ and above all , unshakably strong in their morals and ethics . 
I firmly believe that the people of India must show the way to the world by adhering to this message of Swami Vivekananda . 
We have long symbolised communal peace and harmony - based on tolerance and respect for all faiths . 
We must continue to live up to this and set an example . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , with these words , I sincerely thank the Ramakrishna Mission , Mumbai , for organising this commemoration and the Observer Research Foundation Mumbai for bringing out two very relevant publications on this occasion . 
May we all be inspired by Swami Vivekananda’s thoughts and words and earnestly strive to practice his ideals in our day to day lives . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of the All India Management Association’s Managing India Awards 2013
At the very outset , I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating all the award winners . 
I am happy to join you on this happy occasion - Managing India Awards 2013 . 
These are prestigious corporate awards that recognize outstanding contribution of individuals and organizations to Indian business management . 
Our country today has corporate leaders who can manage the development of Indian business into models of excellence . 
ndian managers are recognized all over the world for their managerial capacity . 
Many global business giants are headed by Indian managers and technocrats today . 
Philip Kotler , the acclaimed expert on Marketing had once observed : 
" Today you have to run faster to stay in place” . 
We have set upon us a challenge to make India count amongst the top few nations in the world . 
To mark India’s growing stature , management principles should find application not only in our business and industry , but also in other important processes such as social change and governance . 
How change is managed will determine our progress . 
This is a need that the Managing India Awards denote , and is also a reality epitomized by this year’s award winners . 
The All India Management Association , formed in 1957 , has been unstinted in its promotion of management excellence in the country . 
It has motivated Indian enterprises to use management capability as an enabling tool for change and progress . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , our country’s economic prospect engages the minds of most today , more so of the corporate leaders and policy makers present here . 
It is true that our economic growth has declined during the last two years . 
It is also true that unless many of our current macro - economic indicators like price level , fiscal balance and current account balance improves , it will be difficult to revive economic growth to the 9 per cent plus levels which is absolutely imperative if we want to achieve the objective of removing poverty in the country . 
But let us not forget that in the decade 2003 - 04 to 2012 - 13 , the average annual economic growth of our economy was a healthy 7 . 93 per cent . 
Of this 10 year period , we have a block of 5 years , from 2008 - 09 to 2012 - 13 , when the world economic growth was extremely sluggish , fragile and uncertain . 
Though our GDP growth in 2012 - 13 at 5 . 0 per cent is the lowest in 10 years , it is much higher than the G - 7 countries . 
International projections point out that our growth will continue to be better than these major economies for the next two years . 
We had adopted a globalization strategy to usher in speedy growth . 
Towards this paradigm , we have progressively liberalized our trade and investment sectors . 
The international trade to GDP ratio of India at 44 per cent signifies the depth of our economy’s integration with the world economy . 
It is therefore hard to expect India’s economy to remain immune from the repercussions of a prolonged global financial crisis . 
The immediate challenge before us is to reverse the deceleration in growth . 
It is possible for us to re - enter the 7 to 8 per cent growth bracket in the next two to three years . But for that , we must revitalize investments in the country . 
The high economic growth after 2003 - 04 was led by a spurt in investments . 
But from 2007 - 08 , the investment rate has continued to decline . 
Tight monetary policy to contain inflation , lack of adequate procedural flexibility for projects and reduction in export demand due to global slowdown has affected private sector investment in India . 
Strengthening the positive investment climate would require us to improve governance of business projects . 
As per an international survey , India does well in parameters like Getting Credit and Protecting Investors . 
But in other important sectors such as Starting a Business , Dealing with Construction Permits , Paying Taxes and Enforcing Contracts , we lag behind many of our competitors . 
We must make our systems more responsive to the industry’s need for facilitation and timely clearances . 
It is gratifying to note that a Cabinet Committee on Investment has been constituted to monitor and review major projects in respect of various licenses and approvals for their time - bound implementation . 
A large amount of financial savings in our country are absorbed in meeting government deficits . 
Deficits should be brought down so that greater proportion of savings is available for investment . 
Steps for fiscal consolidation should make it possible to reduce the fiscal deficit progressively to its target of 3 per cent by 2016 - 17 . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , we must be realistic in our assessment of India’s economic prospects . 
The downbeat atmosphere seen these days is unwarranted . 
Foreign investors are positive about our economy . 
The net inflow from Foreign Institutional Investors at Rs . 1 . 6 lakh crore in 2012 is a substantial rise from the Rs . 39 , 000 crore in 2011 . 
According to an important survey , India is the third most preferred destination for Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) , after China and the US . 
Between April 2012 and January 2013 , over Rs . one lakh crore have come to our economy as FDI . 
. Our infrastructure sector has great potential to make productive use of these investments . 
The sectors with high linkage to infrastructure such as automobile , steel and cement , enjoy high growth in India as compared to many of her competitors . 
A recovery in the advanced economies is expected in 2014 as their economic growth is projected to increase from 1 . 4 per cent in 2013 to 2 . 2 per cent in 2014 . 
We should leverage this growth outlook by enhancing the competitiveness of the domestic industry , especially our export enterprises . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , manpower and technology are the prime drivers of industrial progress . 
Abundant manpower underlines India’s comparative advantage . 
By 2025 , two - third Indians will be in the working age group . 
By that time , 100 million additional jobs will be required for creation in the manufacturing sector alone . 
To develop our manpower as partners of progress , all - round efforts are necessary . 
Greater number of technical institutes is required to be set up . 
Existing technical institutes that lag behind in quality must be up - graded . 
More initiatives like the Vocational Training Improvement Project that envisaged up - gradation of 400 industrial training institutes are necessary . 
I am happy to note that the All India Management Association , in its continuing efforts at manpower development , has set up a Centre for Skill Development and Training . 
The pool of management professionals in our country is not sufficient to meet the demand for such personnel . 
In 2011 - 12 , the enrolment to commerce and management streams in the country was 34 lakh . 
This has to rise and for that more institutes for management education is necessary . 
It is gratifying to note that 7 new Indian Institutes of Management were set up during the Eleventh Plan period . 
The private sector should also play a pivotal role and mark their presence as a major producer of managerial manpower . 
Technology will determine our domestic industry’s ability to beat competition . 
Our research and innovation efforts must aim at technology up - gradation to simplify production processes , improve quality and seek efficiency gains . 
The Industry must partner with the academic and research institutions to develop solutions of wide utility for the market and the common man . 
We have to do much more to be at the forefront of innovation . 
Only one in 50 patent applications in the world is filed in India . 
Our patent regime has the difficult task to sustain encouragement to innovation on the one hand and maintain market competition , and ensure accessibility and affordability , on the other . 
In the words of Late Peter Drucker , the renowned management thinker , " Innovation is the specific instrument of entrepreneurship - the act that endows resources with a new capacity to create wealth” . 
There are several grass root innovations that has the potential for development into marketable products . 
Our Industry should support such micro initiatives so that benefits of new and better products accrue to the society . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , our country needs visionary business leaders to manage India’s transition to a knowledge economy . 
We also require the Indian industry to act as a catalyst for deepening our growth process . 
Our industry should aim at inclusion of all as participants in economic development . 
I have an unshakable faith in our economy’s bright future . 
The winners of Managing India Awards exemplify this conviction . 
Once again , I congratulate all of them for contributing to the country’s progress . 
I am sure they will ignite the minds of other managers and entrepreneurs to think big towards nation building . 
I also wish the All India Management Association all success in their future endeavours . 
Address by The President of India to Parliament
I am delighted to address this first session of both Houses of Parliament after the elections to the 16th Lok Sabha . 
Let me begin by extending warm greetings to my fellow citizens , who participated in large numbers in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections . 
We should never forget that we are here because of them . 
Serving them should be our first priority . 
I also felicitate the members of the new Lok Sabha . 
You have successfully obtained the mandate from the electorate and now you represent their hopes , aspirations and dreams . 
I extend a warm welcome to all of you and hope that the sessions ahead with heavy legislative agenda will be productive and useful . 
It is a matter of great satisfaction that the recent general elections were smooth and largely peaceful . 
I would like to congratulate the Election Commission of India and the official machinery for conducting these elections successfully . 
The unprecedented interest shown by the people of India in the elections is a sign of progressive deepening of our vibrant democracy . 
Before I dwell upon the tasks ahead of us , I would like to express my solidarity with the families of all those who lost their lives during the election process . 
I congratulate the new Speaker of the Lok Sabha on her unanimous election to this august office . 
By successively electing women Speakers , the Lok Sabha has re - affirmed our age - old belief in the importance of women in our society . 
This has been an election of Hope . 
It marks a turning point in the evolution of our democratic polity . 
The surge in aspirations and the belief that these could be realized through democratic processes , has been amply reflected in the record 66 . 4 % participation by voters , and a clear verdict in favour of a single political party after a gap of nearly 30 years . 
The electorate transcended the boundaries of caste , creed , region and religion to come together and vote decisively in favour of Development through Good Governance . 
The country needed a strong and stable government that could provide effective leadership . 
In my Republic Day speech earlier this year , I had hoped for 2014 to be a year of healing after the fractured and contentious politics of the previous years . 
Standing here today , I applaud the wisdom of my fellow citizens for having voted for stability , honesty and development in a resurgent India in which corruption will have no place . 
They have voted for a united , strong , and modern India - " Ek Bharat - Shreshtha Bharat” . 
My government will work to fulfill these aspirations ; with the involvement of all the 125 crore people of this great country .

There is a need for seriously considering all options including linking of rivers , where feasible ; for ensuring optimal use of our water resources to prevent the recurrence of floods and drought . 
By harnessing rain water through ‘Jal Sanchay’ and ‘Jal Sinchan’ , we will nurture water conservation and ground water recharge . 
Micro irrigation will be popularised to ensure ‘Per drop - More crop’ . 
India is the world’s oldest civilization . 
Today it is also a country with the largest population of the youth .

For the Scheduled Tribes , my government will launch a dedicated " Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana” . 
Electrification of tribal hamlets and connecting them with all - weather roads will be a priority area . 
It is unfortunate that even after several decades of independence , sections of minority communities continue to suffer from poverty , as benefits of government schemes do not reach them . 
My government is committed to making all minorities equal partners in India’s progress . 
The government will especially strengthen measures to spread modern and technical education among minority communities and a National Madarsa Modernization Programme will be initiated . 
The welfare and rehabilitation of specially - abled people is integral to my government’s vision of a caring society .

Export potential of this sector will be encouraged . 
My government will make every effort to improve the working conditions of our weavers in particular . 
It will also set up a task force to review and revive our MSME sector . 
Lack of robust infrastructure is one of India’s major impediments . 
The government will chalk out an ambitious infrastructure development programme to be implemented in the next 10 years . 
A fast - track , investment friendly and predictable PPP mechanism will be put in place . 
Modernization and revamping of Railways is on top of the infrastructure agenda .

My government is conscious of the fact that our urban infrastructure is under severe stress . 
Soon , 50 per cent of our population would be residing in urban areas . 
Taking urbanization as an opportunity rather than a challenge , the government will build 100 Cities focussed on specialized domains and equipped with world class amenities . 
Integrated infrastructure will be rolled out in model towns to focus on cleanliness and sanitation . 
By the time the nation completes 75 years of its Independence , every family will have a pucca house with water connection , toilet facilities , 24x7 electricity supply and access . 
While putting the country on a high growth path , my government will keep sustainability at the core of our planning process . 
My government strongly believes that environmental conservation can go hand in hand with development . 
To achieve this , environment and forest clearance systems will be made more predictable , transparent and time - bound . 
Simultaneously , an effective system will be developed for sound appraisal processes and strict compliance of clearance conditions , especially those relating to rehabilitation of displaced communities and regeneration of forests . 
Cleaner fuels will be promoted to bring down pollution levels in our cities . 
The government will earnestly take up mitigation works to meet the challenges posed by climate change and will closely work with the global community in this regard . 
Conservation of Himalayan ecology will be a priority area for my government . 
A National Mission on Himalayas will be launched . 
In the recent past , serious concerns have been expressed regarding use of discretionary powers in allocation of our precious natural resources . 
The government will formulate clear and transparent policies on allocation of critical natural resources such as coal , minerals and spectrum . 
River Ganga is a part of our rich cultural heritage , a symbol of faith and the lifeline for millions . 
However , Ganga continues to remain polluted with many stretches of the river becoming dry in lean season . 
My government will take all necessary steps to ensure a perennial , clean and pristine Ganga . 
Our rich cultural heritage is the very foundation on which rests the unity of our diverse nation . 
Indian languages are repositories of our rich literature , history , culture , art and other achievements . 
My government will launch a national mission " e - Bhasha” that will develop digital vernacular content and disseminate our classic literature in different languages . 
My government will also provide the required resources for the maintenance and restoration of national heritage sites . 
India has a vast untapped potential for tourism which can play a special role in our socio - economic progress . 
The government will initiate a mission mode project to create 50 tourist circuits that are built around specific themes .

We will introduce policies to strengthen technology transfer , including through liberalised FDI in defence production . 
With readily available skilled human resource , India can emerge as a global platform for defence manufacturing including software , which will strengthen our defence and spur industrial development as well as exports . 
The country is proud of its Armed Forces . 
They serve the nation with professionalism , dedication and valour ; securing our nation and supporting relief and rescue operations in the wake of disasters and calamities . 
We will strengthen defence preparedness by modernising our Armed Forces and addressing the shortage of manpower on priority . 
Recognising the importance of coastal security , my government will set up a National Maritime Authority . 
My government will do everything to repay the debt of our brave and selfless soldiers . 
It will appoint a Veterans Commission to address their grievances , so that they know that we don’t stop caring for them when they retire from active service . 
The government will build a National War Memorial to honour the gallantry of our soldiers . One Rank , One Pension scheme will be implemented . 
India’s foreign policy , with its civilizational roots and heritage , is based on the principles of developing peaceful and friendly relations with all countries . 
We will pursue our international engagement based on enlightened national interest , combining the strength of our values with pragmatism , leading to a doctrine of mutually beneficial relationships . 
My government is committed to building a strong , self - reliant and self - confident India ; regaining its rightful place in the comity of nations . 
My government sent a unique and bold signal to the South Asian region and the world , by inviting for the first time in independent India , leaders of all South Asian neighbours to the swearing - in ceremony of the new Council of Ministers on May 26 . 
We are grateful to them for accepting the invitation at such a short notice . 
Their participation , as also the gracious presence of the Prime Minister of Mauritius ; not only added sheen to the ceremony , but also represented a celebration of democracy in the region and convergence of our shared hopes and aspirations . 
This shows my government’s commitment and determination to work towards building a peaceful , stable and economically inter - linked neighbourhood which is essential for the collective development and prosperity of the South Asian Region . 
We will further work together with South Asian leaders to revitalise SAARC as an effective instrument for regional cooperation and as a united voice on global issues . 
At the same time , we will never shy away from raising issues of concern to us at a bilateral level . 
We emphasize that the future of shared prosperity can only be built on the foundation of stability in the region , which requires sensitivity to security concerns and an end to export of terrorism to neighbours . 
My Government will engage energetically with other neighbours in our region , including China , with whom we will work to further develop our Strategic and Cooperative Partnership . 
We will strive to make progress in the many initiatives that are ongoing with Japan , especially in the field of building modern infrastructure in our country . 
Russia remains a privileged and strategic partner and my government will build further on the firm foundations of this relationship . 
India and the United States have made significant progress in developing strategic partnership over the years . 
My government will bring a renewed vigour to our engagement and intensify it in all areas , including trade , investment , science and technology , energy and education . 
India also values its broad - based cooperation with Europe . 
The government will make concerted efforts to achieve progress in key areas with the European Union as well as its leading members . 
To fully realize our softpower potential ; there is a need to integrate it into our external interchange , with particular emphasis on our rich spiritual , cultural and philosophical heritage . 
The government will revive Brand India riding on our strengths of 5T’s : Tradition , Talent , Tourism , Trade and Technology . 
Across the world , we have a vibrant , talented and industrious Indian Diaspora that is a source of great pride for us . 
They have done pioneering work in diverse fields , held the highest public offices and have worked hard to support their localities and families in India . 
While they have contributed immensely to their adopted country , they also carry a little flame of India in their hearts that can light up the promise of change in our country . 
A hundred years ago , in 1915 , India’s greatest Pravasi Bharatiya , Mahatma Gandhi , returned home and transformed the nation’s destiny . 
The next Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas in January 2015 will thus be a special occasion . 
As we celebrate the centenary of Gandhiji’s return to India , we would also take steps that would deepen every Pravasi Bharatiya’s connection with India and involve them in India’s development . 
The people of India have given a clear mandate . 
They want to see a vibrant , dynamic and prosperous India . 
They want to see a resurgent India regaining the admiration and respect of the international community . 
Brimming with hope and expectation , they want quick results . 
With three Ds of Democracy , Demography and Demand on our side , India is poised to actualize these aspirations . 
We must rise to the occasion to fulfill these great expectations . 
In 60 months from now , we should be able to say with confidence and pride that we have done it . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee delivering memorial lecture to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee
I am happy to participate in the celebrations to mark completion of 150 years of the life and work of Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee , one of the towering figures Indian education has ever seen - a man of great personality , courage and extra - ordinary administrative ability . 
I congratulate the ‘Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan , Kolkata Kendra’ and the ‘Ashutosh Mookerjee Memorial institute’ for having taken the initiative to institute a Memorial Lecture in his honour . 
I specially congratulate Justice Chittatosh Mookerjee , the grandson of Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee who is sitting with me on the dais and heads both these institutions . 
The Vidya Bhavan was established in 1938 by Dr . K . M . Munshi , freedom fighter , writer , educationist and ardent environmentalist . 
Munshiji believed that freedom would be meaningless and worthless unless cultural , ethical , and moral values are enshrined in the hearts and minds of our people . 
He therefore felt the need to create an institution that could begin to bring about in a small way a tangible change through education . 
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan which was started as an institution is now a massive cultural and educational movement . 
I am told the Bhavan now has 119 centers in India , 7 centers abroad and 367 constituent institutions , spreading quality , value based education on subjects ranging from Sanskrit and Vedas to Information Technology . 
I take this opportunity to congratulate Shri S . G . Mehta , the President of this prestigious institution for the achievements of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and his leadership . 
Returning to Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee , it is rare to find in one man the combination of such qualities of academic brilliance . 
Sir Ashutosh showed an aptitude for mathematics at an early age . 
When he was young , he met Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar who was a major influence on him . 
In 1879 , at the age of fifteen , he passed the entrance exam of the Calcutta University in which he stood third and received a first grade scholarship . 
In the year 1880 , he took admission in the Presidency College in Kolkata where he met P . C . Ray and Narendranath Dutta who would later become famous as Swami Vivekananda . In 1883 , he topped the BA examination at Calcutta University . 
In 1885 , he completed M . A . in Mathematics and in 1886 , Masters in Physics , making him the first student to be awarded a dual degree from Calcutta University ( MA in Mathematics and Physics ) 
Sir Ashutosh was an ‘integrated’ persona . 
He began his career as a mathematician , but went on to become an outstanding legal luminary . 
He was thus a wonderful example of an interdisciplinary scholar . 
In recognition of his brilliance , Sir Ashutosh was offered a job in the Department of Public Instruction . 
But , he chose to turn it down and instead complete a degree in Bachelor of Law . 
During this time , he also continued publishing scholarly papers on mathematics and physics . 
At the age of 24 , Ashutosh Mookerjee became a Fellow of the Calcutta University . 
Sir Ashutosh was a linguist , steeped in the knowledge of ancient Indian scriptures as well as humanities and science . 
He was learned in Pali , French and Russian . 
He was further an outstanding lawyer who rose to be Judge of the Calcutta High Court and a brilliant administrator who rose to be the Vice - Chancellor of Calcutta University for five two year terms . 
Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee’s achievements continue . 
He was responsible for the foundation of the Bengal Technical Institute in 1906 and the College of Science of the Calcutta University in 1914 . 
Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee was thrice elected president of The Asiatic Society . 
The Calcutta Mathematical Society was founded by Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee in 1908 . 
He served as the President of the Society from 1908 to 1923 . 
In 1910 , he was appointed the President of the Imperial ( now National ) Library Council and his personal collection of 80 , 000 books were donated to the National Library , which are arranged there in a separate section . 
He was the President of the inaugural session of the Indian Science Congress in 1914 . 
The Ashutosh College was founded under his stewardship in 1916 , when he was Vice - chancellor of University of Calcutta . 
Along with Dr . Ziauddin Ahmed , Sir Ashutosh was also appointed member of the 1917 - 1919 Sadler Commission , presided over by Michael Ernest Sadler , which inquired into the state of Indian education . 
Under the guidance of Sir Ashutosh , Calcutta University became a major center of learning and research in the Indian sub - continent encompassing students from Lahore to Rangoon . 
Despite resistance from the Viceroy and the British Government who viewed Calcutta University as a cradle of trouble makers , Sir Ashutosh set up several new academic programs in subjects such as comparative literature , anthropology , applied psychology , industrial chemistry , ancient Indian history and culture as well as Islamic culture . 
He also instituted post - graduate teaching and research in Bengali , Hindi , Pali and Sanskrit . 
He used to say " the term " Sanskrit” though composed of eight letters connotes in the domain of knowledge an empire by itself” . 
Sir Ashutosh was fiercely independent . 
He was often called the " Tiger of Bengal " for his high self - esteem , courage , academic integrity and a general intransigent attitude towards the British Government . 
The French scholar Sylvain Lévi once commented : 
" Had this Bengal Tiger been born in France , he would have exceeded even Georges Clemenceau , the French Tiger . Ashutosh had no peer in the whole of Europe . ”
Lord Curzon ' s Education Mission in 1902 identified Universities including the Calcutta University , as centres of sedition where young people formed networks of resistance to colonial domination . 
The cause of this was thought to be the unwise granting of autonomy to these universities in the nineteenth century . 
Thus in the period of 1905 to 1935 , the colonial administration tried to reinstate government control of education , which Sir Ashutosh strongly resisted . 
Reflecting his sterling character , he refused the post of Vice Chancellor in 1923 when Lord Lytton tried to impose conditions on his reappointment . 
To quote Sir Ashutosh , " Dynasties may come and go , political parties may rise or fall , the influence of men may change , but Universities go on forever . . as undefiled altars of inviolate truth . 
Sir Ashutosh had a clear vision of the kind of education he wanted young people to have and he extracted it from his colonial masters with acumen and courage . 
Sir Ashutosh was , forever , a man working towards excellence in Educational Institutions – the theme for today’s lecture . 
Through determination , zeal , hard work and above all remarkable leadership skills , he raised the University of Calcutta to heights never seen before . 
What are the lessons modern day educational institutions and Administrators should learn from Sir Ashutosh ? 
Friends , Sir Ashutosh strived to raise Calcutta University to the ranks of leading institutions of the world . 
Similarly , we must transform our Universities into world class institutions . 
Indian civilization has a long standing knowledge tradition . 
Our ancient universities - Takshashila , Nalanda , Vikramashila , Valabhi , Somapura and Odantapuri – were renowned seats of learning that attracted scholars from outside . 
In fact , for almost 1500 years , from the founding of Takshashila in 3rd century BC to the collapse of Nalanda in 12th Century AD , India was a world leader in the field of higher education . 
Sadly , today our universities lag behind the best universities in the world . 
None of the Indian institutions figure in the top two hundred ranks according to international surveys . 
We must urgently salvage the declining standards of our country’s higher education as a top priority . 
Our leadership in fields such as science and technology is incumbent on the level of competence in our scientists , academics , engineers and doctors . 
Secondly , modern day Indians must learn from Sir Ashutosh the importance of ensuring cross fertilization of ideas through interaction of scholars from across India and abroad . 
Our educational institutions should break down the silos in which different disciplines function and strive for a harmonious interchange of thoughts between the humanities , science , languages and other disciplines . This was the atmosphere which used to prevail in Nalanda and Takshashila in their days of glory . 
In an address in Mysore , Sir Ashutosh said " we cannot sit on the lovely snow - capped peaks of the Himalayas absorbed in contemplation of our glorious past . 
We cannot waste precious time and strength in defence of theories and systems which , however , valuable in their own days , have been swept away by the irresistible avalanche of worldwide changes… . . we can live neither in nor by our defeated past and if we would live in the conquering future , we must dedicate our whole strength to shape its course… . 
Let us raise an emphatic protest against all suicidal policy of isolation and stagnation . 
Thirdly , Sir Ashutosh recognized the importance of research being a Mathematician of substance himself . 
Under his patronage Sir CV Raman went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics , the first for science in Asia . 
Currently , research is a neglected domain in our higher education structure . 
Successful research programmes offer vast possibilities to make a difference in the lives of people . 
A developing country like India has to address the grand challenges of renewable energy , climate change , drinking water and sanitation . 
Research in these areas will have spin - offs unimaginable in terms of benefits to the common man . 
Our universities have to be the breeding ground for creative pursuits . 
They have to be the source of cutting edge innovation and technological developments . 
Universities must through their inventions and discoveries lead in the registration of patents for our country . 
Fourthly , we must recognize that good faculty is a critical component of our education system . 
Our universities must be able to identify ‘inspired teachers’ who can motivate students to think from different perspectives and spur holistic learning . 
Such teachers should be encouraged to mentor junior teachers and students . Sir Ashutosh was instrumental in discovering the talents of Sir CV Raman and Dr . S . Radha Krishnan . 
Teachers of Calcutta University in his time included Meghnad Saha , Satyendranath Bose , Brojendranath Seal , H . M . Percival , Ganesh Prasad , P . C . Mitra , S . P . Agharkar , A . R . Forsyth and Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray . 
He brought many scholars from European Universities to teach at Calcutta University . 
He did not hesitate to go beyond the realms of academics and recruit people like Sir CV Raman who was an employee of the Calcutta Mint . 
Sir Ashutosh , thus demonstrated courage of conviction and an ability to take risks - a quality worthy of emulation by our Vice - Chancellors of today . 
Fifthly , academic autonomy should be preserved at all costs . Sir Ashutosh in his famous speech in the Senate ( December 1922 ) said ‘… . I call upon you , as members of the Senate to stand up for the rights of your University . 
Forget the Government of India . 
Do your duty as Senators of the University , as true sons of your Alma Mater . 
Freedom first , freedom second and freedom always – nothing else will satisfy me’ . 
In another address in 1923 , Sir Ashutosh said : 
" We stand unreservedly by the doctrine that if education is to be our policy as a nation , it must not be our politics ; freedom is its very life blood , the condition of its growth , the secret of its success… . there stands forth unshaken the conviction that our insistent claim for the freedom of the University is a fight for the most sacred and impalpable of national privileges” . 
Lastly , students of Universities should be actively encouraged to have a passion for their alma mater and to contribute actively to its growth and development once they leave the portals of the university . 
Speaking in his last Convocation address , Sir Ashutosh said , Fellow - graduates , you speak of this University as your Alma Mater . 
Do you always realize the nobility of this commonplace expression ? 
What a singular endearment it voices , our fostering mother - what a fine relation is that for a great institution of learning to bear to all those who throughout the years have learned wisdom at her feet and have gone out into the world , sustained by her strength and inspired by her lofty example… . . In whatever sphere your lot may be cast , whatever be your hopes and fears , turn back to your Alma Mater with filial piety and attachment… . ”
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen , transformative ideas are required to steer our educational institutions from the muddy waters of mediocrity . 
Governance structures have to be supportive of innovative ideas and also facilitative of faster decision - making . 
The expertise and experience of alumni , who are well - established , can be utilized for effective university management . 
Studies have shown how alumni participation in university governance improves academic performance . 
Our universities , especially the older ones , should make a definitive move towards engaging alumni in their activities . 
Friends , education separates light and darkness ; advancement from backwardness ; excellence from mediocrity . 
If one investment can truly define a subtle linkage to future progress , it is education . 
Countries built on the strength of education and knowledge has achieved development over longer periods of time . 
Such countries have exhibited greater adaptive powers to changes in resource endowments . 
Education has afforded them the ability to overcome resource constraints and build an economy on a high technological base . 
If India has to be one of the front ranking nations in the world , the way ahead is only through a robust education system . 
Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee , if he had wanted could have become an expert on Asian studies or a great mathematician or a famous jurist . 
But , instead he chose to gift the best years of his life to be an Educational Administrator . 
On the passing away of Sir Ashutosh , Michael Sadler wrote ‘In Ashutosh Mookerjee , India has lost one of her greatest men ; the world , one of its commanding personalities . 
He was mighty in battle . 
He could have ruled an empire . 
But he gave the best of his powers to Education because he believed that in Education rightly lies the secret of human welfare and the key to every empire’s moral strength’ . 
Speaking about Sir Ashutosh , Gurudev Tagore wrote : 
Men are always rare in all countries through whom the aspiration of their people can hope to find its fulfilment , who have the thundering voices to say that what is needed shall be done ; Ashutosh had the magic voice of assurance . 
He had the courage to dream because he had the power to fight and the confidence to win – his will itself was the path to the goal . 
India needs today many more such individuals willing to dedicate their lives to improving the quality of education in our country . 
I call upon the leaders of our educational institutions to follow in the footsteps of this great son of India . 
I thank the organizers for having invited me to deliver this lecture . 
Let me offer my humble tribute to this great soul in whose honour I speak today and my best wishes to the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and the Ashutosh Mookerjee Memorial Institute for all their future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of National Florence Nightingale Award
It gives me immense pleasure in greeting all on International Nurses’ Day . 
I extend to you – and through you , to the members of the nursing profession in India , my warm greetings and felicitations . 
At the very outset , I would like to offer my congratulations to the thirty five outstanding men and women who have been conferred the National Florence Nightingale Awards for the year 2014 . 
They have distinguished themselves through their exceptional service and extraordinary dedication in the care of the sick and the infirm . 
They have brought credit to a vocation that is chosen by the most selfless and compassionate among us . 
In recognizing them , we pay tribute to the entire corps of nursing personnel in India . 
In the 6th Century BC , Sushruta , who is remembered today as the " Father of Surgery” in India had written , " The Physician , the patient , the drugs and the nurse are the four feet or ‘padas’ of medicine , upon which the cure depends” . 
It is , indeed , interesting that the first nursing school in India , established in 250 B . C . by Acharya Charaka , one of the principal contributors to the ancient science of ayurveda , had admitted only male nurses . 
If we look at the chronology of modern nursing in India , we will see that in the mid - 1600s , a military hospital in Kolkata , run by the East India Company had to send for nurses from a hospital in London . 
About two centuries later , in 1865 , Florence Nightingale , drew up the detailed " Suggestions on a system of nursing for hospitals in India” . 
It was her insight that guided the reform of nursing and set new parameters and precedence , creating a model that is still followed all over the world . 
Her birth anniversary , the 12th of May is aptly commemorated as International Nurses’ Day . 
Just around the same time , in 1867 , it is recorded that St . Stephens’ Hospital in New Delhi opened the first nurses’ training school for Indian women . 
Not till 1946 did India have a 4 - year Bachelors Degree course in nursing –offered by the College of Nursing in Delhi and also in Vellore . 
After India’s independence , a Master’s Degree course was started in 1960 , at the Rajkumari Amrit Kaur College of Nursing in New Delhi . 
The nursing profession in India has certainly come a long way since then . 
Today , nurses are the largest workforce in the healthcare industry in India . 
Nursing services and capacity building have expanded considerably since Independence and their roles and responsibilities have multiplied over the years . 
The theme selected by the International Council of Nurses , " Nurses : A force for change – A vital resource for health” , is quite appropriate . 
The Council has rightly recommended that the nursing workforce in India can be an instrument of change - through better workforce planning , improvement in its education and work environment and through a constructive process of assessing and addressing the nursing workload . 
India’s healthcare industry today is worth more than 45 billion dollars . 
It , however , accounts for less that 1 % of the global healthcare industry – even though it serves about 17 % of the world population . 
The strength of nurses in India is currently 0 . 8 nurses per 1000 citizens . 
This , compared to the world average of 3 nurses per 1000 is quite low . 
To come closer to the world average , our healthcare system would need to add about 2 million more nurses to its numbers . 
Presently , we are graduating about 180 , 000 trained nurses annually . 
At this rate , it would probably take decades for India to reach the 2 million figure . 
Despite this prognosis , there is much that we can do to reform and upgrade our capacities . 
Nurses in India can definitively participate in strengthening the current nursing framework in India . 
As trainers and system innovators , they can do much to develop better methods and educate the communities in which they live and work . 
I would emphasise that given India’s broader national goals in healthcare reform , the nursing fraternity would need to go even further – by substantively contributing to policy development - and ensuring that it evolves in the right direction – responding to the needs of our diverse communities . 
I would encourage them to involve themselves in reviewing and re - modelling practices , modernising methods and rising to the challenges . 
They must expand their vision . 
Government of India has taken a number of steps to facilitate reform in the nursing sector . 
These include opening of nursing colleges , strengthening and upgrading of existing schools of nursing and creating new models for nursing and para - medical education . 
Government’s efforts to amend outdated regulations and policies are intended to support the efforts and initiatives of nursing associations and organisations like the Nursing Council of India and afford them opportunities as well as facilities to evolve and improve in every way . 
Today , our nursing fraternity - in the Government sector as well as the private sector , has directly and indirectly helped in implementing important health and family welfare programmes of the Government of India . 
They have applied their skills - and strictly followed the highest standards of discipline - to enhance their ability to give the finest quality healthcare . 
It is no wonder that they have earned goodwill and admiration all over the world for their efficiency and commitment . 
I congratulate them . 
The awards conferred today are a fitting acknowledgment of your contribution . 
The nation salutes you as it honours you today . 
I would like to convey to you the gratitude of the people of India and offer you my best wishes for your good work in the years ahead . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the dedication of rupay card to The Nation
I am indeed happy to be amidst you this afternoon for the RuPay dedication function . 
RuPay – I am told – is the fruit of five years of hard work . It is a new service to facilitate people and organisations in the country to make payments to one another by use of a payment card instead of cash , cheques , drafts or wire transfer . 
I understand that India is one of the few countries in the world to have such a network built domestically to meet the card - based payment system needs of the country . 
I congratulate Reserve Bank of India for having envisioned the need for such an indigenously managed service in 2005 and for entrusting this task to the National Payments Corporation soon after its operationalization in 2010 . 
I am told that it usually takes five to seven years to build a fully functional card payment network . 
I am happy that the Corporation could make the RuPay service operational by April 2013 . 
Today , RuPay cards are accepted at all ATMs , more than 90 % of ‘Point of Sale’ ( POS ) Terminals and more than 10 , 000 e - Commerce merchants in the country . 
It is also heartening to note that a few banks have started issuing cards which are accepted internationally through the network of an international partner . 
The RuPay Scheme provides flexibility to card issuing banks to issue special purpose cards like Kisan Cards , Milk Procurement Cards , Grain Procurement Cards and Financial Inclusion Cards . 
I have been briefed that the card payment system operates on a very sound four - party operating procedure uniformly adopted in all the countries in the world . 
The roles and responsibilities of four parties – the Issuing bank , customers , merchants and the Acquiring banks are well defined and the procedure is the same across all countries . 
At the centre , remains the card scheme provider like the ‘National Payments Corporation’ ( NPCI ) for clearing and settlement . 
The creativity lies in developing products meeting the special needs of the customers by the issuing banks . 
Once the rail roads for card payments are built , the same card can be used at ATMs for cash withdrawal or remittance transactions . 
The same card can similarly be used on the internet for bill payment or e - Commerce transactions . 
For a large country like India with a rapidly growing economy , the volume of payment transactions , specially those settled through cards , will be significant in the years ahead . 
Transactions which are mostly settled today either by way of cash or cheque will progressively make way for card based payment transactions as the economy matures and internet penetration increases . 
An indigenous system like RuPay will , hopefully , not only reduce the dependence on cash and cheque modes of settlement but will also make it easier to offer products based on specific requirements of diverse user sets within the country . 
I am told that one such innovation of RuPay is the Kisan cards issued to farmers in order to enable them to withdraw cash from any ATM without having to visit any bank branch . 
The card can also be used at fertilisers / farm equipment shops or for general consumption as stipulated under the Kisan card Scheme . 
I compliment National Payments Corporation for enabling the banks to implement the Kisan card Scheme . 
Seven million cards issued so far is only a fraction of the potential . 
Launch of milk procurement pre - paid card by milk procurement agencies or grain procurement agencies in Punjab are other such variants of the card payment mechanism which only a card payment system developed within the country can appreciate and implement faster . 
In the light of this background , dedication of RuPay to the nation is symbolic of the maturity of the payment system development in India and contribution of the National Payments Corporation of India to nation building . 
I am pleased to dedicate the RuPay - our Country’s Own card , to the nation and wish it great success in the coming days . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of National Film Awards including The Dada Saheb Phalke Award
It is indeed a privilege for me to be present amidst you on the occasion of the 61st National Films Awards . 
The National Film Awards are an annual milestone in the nation’s cinematic history . 
t not only symbolizes public accolade and mass acceptance but also immense prestige befitting the highest governmental recognition in the field of cinema . 
I heartily congratulate the recipients of the 61st National Awards . 
My special congratulations go to Gulzaar ji who has been honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award this year . 
His contribution to cinema , as a writer , poet and a film maker of rare sensitivity , has been tremendous . 
he nation has honoured him with a Padma Bhushan and Hollywood with an Oscar . 
The Dada Saheb Phalke award is yet another feather in his cap . We are proud of you , Mr . Gulzar . 
I understand that a record - breaking number of more than 470 entries were received this year . 
This is indicative of the growth of quality cinema in our country and the importance the Indian film fraternity attaches to National Film Awards . 
My compliments to all Members of the distinguished Jury for their commendable though onerous job of selecting Award winners . 
This task , I am sure , must be very challenging and daunting . 
The vibrant Indian film industry produces over 1000 films in more than a dozen languages annually . 
Our cinema is not only a showcase of the multicultural diversity of our country but is also a tribute to our linguistic richness . 
It is a national treasure and our country’s " soft power” in the true sense of the term , forging international ties and connecting global horizons with ease . 
I take this opportunity to reflect upon an important aspect of cinema . 
Besides being a strong medium of expression , cinema is a vehicle of influence and persuasion for the youth . 
When our children witness scenes depicting violence and bloodshed , it does affect their psyche . 
It is incumbent on our film makers to make a concerted effort to distinguish between what clearly is an art form and what is not . 
The cinematic content of films should have a desirable impact on the social behaviour of people , especially the new generation . 
Faced with erosion of values in today’s context , cinema should play a catalytic role in resetting our moral compass . 
Our film makers should deploy their creative efforts to present and propagate core values such as patriotism , respect for women , compassion and tolerance , and honesty and discipline . 
I am hopeful that everyone associated with the film industry will use their talent , creativity and artistic pursuits to create meaningful and socially relevant cinema . 
India’s media and entertainment industry is today at the cusp of a transformation . 
It is poised to leapfrog into a completely digital landscape . 
Indian cinema connects with millions of people – within the country and abroad , directly through theatres , close to two thousand multiplexes and through TV as well as the Internet . 
In 2013 , the Indian Media and Entertainment ( M & E ) industry registered a growth of 11 . 8 per cent over 2012 and did a gross business of around Rs . 92 , 000 crore . 
The industry is expected to register a compound annual growth rate of 14 . 2 per cent to touch Rs . 1 . 8 lakh crore by 2018 . 
Technology and scientific advancements of this digital decade has thrown open the floodgates of opportunities . 
However , it is the triumph of the human spirit and the building of real talent that will always define the cinematic progress . 
We need storytellers to tell us the stories ; artistes to translate these stories into celluloid ; content creators and content editors to make our stories slick and cinematographers to speak to our souls through images . 
As we embrace the future , we must continue to draw inspiration from the cinematic greats of India - Dadasaheb Phalke , Satyajit Ray , Ritwik Ghatak , Bimal Roy , Mrinal Sen , Adoor Gopalakrishnan , M . S . Sathyu , Girish Kasaravalli , Guru Dutt and many others who have been torchbearers within the country and on the world stage . 
I am happy to note that more and more young film makers are entering the field of documentaries . 
Documentaries provide an opportunity to address contemporary social subjects , many of which have been long swept under the carpet on account of the discomforting questions they raise . 
I am happy to note that the Government is contributing towards strengthening the documentary movement in the country by holding an International Film Festival of documentaries every two years . 
We are approaching completion of Elections to the 16th Lok Sabha , the most extensive electoral exercise undertaken anywhere in the world and what commentators call a ‘Festival of Democracy’ . 
It is heartening that many from the film industry have , on their own and in collaboration with the Election Commission , have actively promoted participation by citizens in the democratic process and in particular , emphasized the importance of casting the vote . 
I note the participation of a large number of luminaries from the film industry in the electoral contest this year . 
Many important political leaders have emerged from the film industry in our country and cinema has played a critical role in highlighting social and political issues of concern as well as exposing the deficiencies in our political system . 
The Indian film industry comprises of people drawn from different parts of the country , who speak different languages , profess different religions and belong to different strata of society . 
It is an industry which has provided opportunities for many to rise from rag to riches . 
I call upon the film industry to nurture and strengthen its openness , pluralism and inclusiveness and disseminate the same throughout the country . 
I once again convey my compliments to the Members of the Jury , each of whom is an eminent film personality , for the commendable job done by them , and congratulate once again all the award winners of today . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the enforcement day function organized by enforcement directorate on the occasion of its foundation day
I am happy to be here today on the occasion of the Enforcement Day . 
To celebrate Foundation Day is significant as it gives an opportunity to pause and reflect where we began , where we are and what is our future action plan . 
I take this opportunity of welcoming Mr . Vladimir Nechaev of the Russia Federation , President of the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) , and Mr . Mario Michel Affentranger , of the Federal Office of Justice , Swiss Confederation . 
The presence of Mr . Nechaev also highlights India’s role in the FATF . 
I take this opportunity to recall that as the then Finance Minister , I had approved the Action Plan that India submitted to FATF , which then led to India becoming a member of this inter - governmental organization . 
I also had the privilege of introducing in Parliament the Amendment Bill 2011 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) , through which , our nation strengthened the money laundering legislation , in line with the Recommendations of FATF . 
Mr . Affentranger’s presence underlines the growing bilateral relations between Switzerland and India and also the partnership between the counterpart agencies . 
Money laundering is a global menace , and law enforcement agencies all over the world have to cooperate to fight it . 
The cornerstone of any democracy is the respect for law and order in that country , including compliance to the economic laws . 
It is essential for economic activities to be in accordance with the legal fram¬¬¬ework and national priorities . 
The Enforcement Directorate has played a historical role in orderly development and maintenance of the foreign exchange market . 
The Directorate should continue to ensure that the external trade is facilitated , and investment environment is stimulated by sifting the genuine foreign exchange transactions from those which are fraudulent and undesirable . 
Effective measures against Money Laundering and Terror Financing are essential in today’s global economic and security environment , and these are rightly being addressed on priority by most of the countries . 
Such measures also foster a more business friendly setting and facilitate legitimate investments and financial flows . 
India too has put in place a strong Anti Money Laundering legislation , the Prevention of Money Laundering Act . 
I understand that the Directorate has been making rapid strides in investigating cases under the Act , attaching the laundered proceeds of crime , and launching prosecutions against the offenders . 
In some cases , the Directorate has succeeded in tracing and restraining the laundered proceeds in jurisdictions outside our territory limit . 
These attachments of laundered proceeds of crime have bolstered public confidence in them . 
International cooperation is essential to tackle cross - border money laundering and terror financing . 
The Directorate should intensify its efforts at actively engaging with money laundering investigation agencies of other countries . 
Our officers must learn from best investigative techniques of other countries . 
I’m sure many other countries could also benefit from the best practices which we have . 
The Directorate should aim to work out modalities with international partners so that action with regard to restoration of stolen assets spirited abroad is expedited . 
Multilateral fora such as the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) , the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism ( EAG ) , and the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering ( APG ) also need to be optimally utilized by the Enforcement Directorate for bilateral exchanges and follow up with counterpart enforcement agencies for better mutual cooperation on Anti Money Laundering ( AML ) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism ( CFT ) . 
I have been given to understand that the Enforcement Directorate has traced and attached a large variety of laundered assets . 
I have also seen from media reports that the assets range from cash and bank accounts to vehicles , land , residential and office buildings , and industrial units . 
These assets will finally vest to the Government only after the due legal process is completed . 
During this period , Directorate should concentrate on working out and implementing protocols for safeguarding these assets , while the legal processes for their confiscation continue . 
The process of globalisation and rapid advances in information and communications technology has shrunk the world . 
Money can nowadays move very quickly across national borders . 
To stay ahead of the curve , the Directorate should develop expertise in financial investigations and detection of cross border flows . 
The Directorate should also look at adopting state of the art technology in relevant areas such as communications , technical infrastructure and computer forensics . 
The Enforcement Directorate has been carrying out sensitive work , which requires a high degree of responsibility and confidentiality . 
he Enforcement Directorate should get adequate resources in terms of money and manpower , technology and legal expertise , so that it can effectively fight against money laundering . 
In 2011 , the organizational strength of the Directorate was enhanced almost three times from 745 to 2 , 064 to expand its capacity for investigation . 
The working environment in the Directorate should be such as to encourage the best to join and work . 
The Enforcement officials should perform their duty with utmost efficiency and integrity which I am happy most of them are doing . 
They should be appropriately motivated and incentivized . 
I take this opportunity to congratulate the officials of the Directorate who have been commended today for their distinguished and meritorious services . 
I am confident that the awardees will serve as role models for many others in the organization , and motivate them to maintain high standards of professionalism and to discharge their duties with honesty and integrity without fear or favour . 
On Enforcement Day , I urge the Directorate to rededicate itself to the fulfilment of its mandate , to achieve greater efficiency , to impartially investigate and bring to book money launderers and economic offenders , and to do so in a time - bound manner . 
I call upon all its personnel not to be content with its achievements so far , but to aim higher and benchmark its processes and actions with international best practices . 
With these words , I thank you once again and wish you all success in your future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the fourteenth convocation of Manipur University
I am happy to join you for this fourteenth convocation of Manipur University , which is a premier centre of higher learning in North - East India . 
Manipur University , since establishment in 1980 has rendered yeoman service in promoting education in the North - Eastern region . 
Through its curriculum , it has fostered the composite culture of India . 
Its programmes and policies have always aimed at encouraging the spirit of humanism , tolerance and enquiry . 
I call upon its torchbearers to continue developing this University with conviction , industry and determination . 
I congratulate all those who are receiving degrees today . 
I also congratulate Shri Rishang Keishing , who has been conferred the Doctor of Law ; and Shri L . Birendrakumar Singh , who has been conferred the Doctor of Literature . 
Convocation is a red - letter event for any academic institution . 
It holds great significance and underlines a genuine milestone in the life of its students and even teachers . 
It is a day when the fruit of years of hard work and perseverance is acknowledged . 
You will leave the hallowed precincts of this university with the armoury of knowledge and strength of character . 
Go to the world outside ; make a difference ; touch and transform the lives of people around you , and create a happier universe . 
Education separates light and darkness ; advancement from backwardness ; excellence from mediocrity . 
If one investment can truly define a subtle linkage to future progress , it is education . 
Countries built on the strength of education and knowledge have achieved development over longer periods of time . 
Such countries have exhibited greater adaptive powers to changes in resource endowments . 
Education has afforded them the ability to overcome resource constraints and build an economy on a high technological base . 
If India has to be one of the front ranking nations in the world , the way ahead is only through a robust education system . 
India has a sizeable number of young people , with two - third of the population below 35 years of age . 
Their grooming is essential as they are our future . 
Enrolment in higher education is below 20 per cent in India . 
Recognizing that this is not enough and may drag down the potential of our future generation , rapid strides have been made to expand the higher education infrastructure . 
A decisive step was the creation of several central universities during the last decade , including Manipur University which was made a Central University in 2005 . 
These universities along with the existing ones are envisaged as trail blazers for ushering in a high quality knowledge society . 
These bastions of higher education are seen as capable of attaining the repute of ancient India’s citadels of higher learning like Nalanda and Takshashila . 
Yet , if we undertake an honest analysis of the state of higher education in our country today , it is easy to decipher that many higher academic institutions lack the quality to produce graduates for the global market . 
Not a single Indian university figures in the list of top 200 universities in the world . 
I have been sharing my concerns about the performance of Indian institutions in world university rankings during my visits to the universities . 
This issue was also discussed in the Annual Conference of Vice Chancellors of Central Universities held in the Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
I am happy to find that our institutions have started to accord due seriousness to the rankings process . 
In September last year , the Finance module of IIM , Calcutta was adjudged by a reputed agency as the best amongst business schools offering the Master of Management programme . 
In the World University Ranking done subject - wise by another reputed agency , two IITs - Madras and Bombay - are amongst the top 50 institutions in civil engineering , while IITs - Delhi and Bombay - are in the top 50 in electrical engineering . 
I want our institutions to build up on these micro - level successes and achieve a much higher overall ranking . 
We have to rise from our slumber and beat the inertia that defines our current state of functioning . 
Faculty is the bedrock of education . 
The quality of teachers is a portrayal of the educational standards . 
Several measures are required for faculty development . 
The vacant teacher positions have to be filled up on priority . 
Talented faculty from abroad have to be hired to inject new thinking and diversity in academic approach . 
The Scholar - in - Residence ‘ENCORE’ programme and Faculty Recharge Programme of the UGC have to be utilized better . 
Many ills that afflict efficient functioning of our universities stem from the lack of good governance practices . 
Governance structures have to promote faster and transparent decision - making . 
In this context , the induction of reputed alumni into the governance mechanism could provide the dynamism that our institutions are often in short supply of . 
Alumni expertise can also be drafted to review existing courses and introduce new ones . 
A concerted effort has to be made to develop a wide - ranging partnership with the industry . 
An institutional arrangement for industry - academia interface is essential to explore the contours of collaboration like sponsorship of research endowments and chairs , and conduct of internship programmes . 
Technology is a knowledge carrier and information disseminator par excellence . 
Knowledge networks facilitate intellectual collaboration . 
They mitigate physical constraints as well . 
Effective use of technology - based media for greater academic exchange is the need of the hour . 
The research neglect in our universities has to be reversed . 
We have to adopt a multi - disciplinary approach in our academic system as most research activity requires the meeting of minds from diverse disciplines . 
We have to concentrate on the unique features of the region in which a university is located . 
Manipur University can prioritize its research expertise keeping in mind that this State is a bio - diversity hotspot . 
Our universities have a duty to create inquisitiveness and promote scientific temper amongst their students . 
A way forward could be to give wings to the ingenuous ideas of students and grassroots innovators . 
Novel ideas that can be nurtured into viable products deserve mentoring by the universities . 
An initiative taken in several central universities is the setting up of Innovation Clubs . 
To refine this further , activities of such clubs have to be dovetailed with innovation incubators located in IITs and NITs in the region . 
The engagement of clubs with incubators will help create an ‘innovation web’ , to provide linkage between advanced centres of research and the common man . 
I am hopeful of Manipur University spearheading many innovations in a few years’ time and am glad to know that some steps have already been taken by the University in this regard . 
Friends , Manipur is a beautiful state that has excelled nationally and internationally in the fields of art , culture and sports . 
India is proud of the achievements made by the young men and women of Manipur and looks forward to them bringing more glory to our country in the future . 
It is important that all people , especially , the youth of this state recognize that economy and society can flourish only in an atmosphere free from violence . 
No problem is ever resolved by violence . 
Violence only aggravates the pain and the hurt on every side . 
I call upon the youth of Manipur to join hands with the youth of the rest of the country in forging the future of our nation . 
India is today a nation on the move . 
In every field of activity – be it business , industry , trade , education or culture , our billion plus people are marching vigorously forward led by the ideas , enterprise and energy of our predominantly young population . 
The emerging India offers enormous opportunities for the youth of Manipur . 
My appeal to the youth of Manipur is therefore ‘Let the dark days of violence and conflict be left behind . Let a new dawn emerge . 
Let us move ahead with faith in our collective future’ . 
Let me assure you that the Government of India and the State Government of Manipur are determined and duty bound to ensure that every Manipuri lives with dignity and has equal rights and opportunities . 
It is for this reason that several major economic development and infrastructure projects are being taken up in the State . 
I congratulate the people of Manipur for the successful and peaceful conduct of elections . 
Let us celebrate the fact that India is the largest democracy in the world though sometimes noisy . 
Elections to the 16th Lok Sabha are under way and the people of our country , including the people of this State have turned out in record numbers to cast their votes and assert their rights . 
I am happy to know that the Manipur University Students Union which was disbanded in 2009 is now being revived from the next academic session . 
I am sure that it will play an important and constructive role in improving the welfare of students of this University . 
It is unfortunate that the capital city of Delhi had some time back witnessed certain tragic incidents of attacks on young people from the north - east . 
We must ensure that the pluralistic character of our nation and the thread of India’s unity , which is the collective pride of all Indians , are not weakened by such unacceptable events . 
I am happy that both the Central Government and the Delhi Government have taken firm action , by not only apprehending and punishing the accused but also putting in place measures to ensure that such incidents do not recur . 
India is on the threshold of new opportunities and higher achievements . 
Assuming global leadership by India is no longer a utopian proposition . 
You , the educated youth of our country , will build this resurgent new India . 
Use the education you have received here to become the change - agents in society . 
Draw inspiration from the words of Mahatma Gandhi who said and I quote : 
" Essence of education lies in drawing out the very best that is in you” . 
I wish Manipur University great success in the years ahead and all of you the very best . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the special show of change - over of ceremonial army guard battalion
Today , I am pleased to witness the change - over of Ceremonial Army Guard battalion from 28 MADRAS to 8 Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry , in a ceremony which is happening for the first time at the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan
The MADRAS Regiment being one of the oldest regiments of the Indian Army , has a rich tradition of valour and courage and has rendered a distinguished service to the nation since its inception
The personnel have always set the highest standards in pursuit of excellence that others would do well to emulate . 
The glory , courage , sacrifice and devotion to duty displayed by the ‘Thambis’ both on Indian soil and abroad , stands testimony to same . 
My heartfelt compliments to Colonel Praveen H , his team of officers and brave men of 28 MADRAS for successfully tenating the tasks entrusted to them as the Army Guard Battalion at Rashtrapati Bhavan from May 2011 to Apr 2014 . 
28 MADRAS has a glorious history since raising and has proved its mettle during various operations in varied terrains . 
The Battalion has rightfully been awarded with two unit citations and a plethora of other bravery awards since its raising . 
This has been possible due to the dedication , sincerity and professionalism of the troops , both past and present of the Battalion . 
As the Army Guard Battalion in Rashtrapati Bhavan , whether presenting arms to state guests and high officials visiting the country , or presenting arms whenever I depart and arrive at the Rashtrapati Bhavan , or the Guard saluting everyday before and after my walk in the Mughal Gardens , personnel of 28 MADRAS have always displayed highest standards of drill , turnout , bearing and discipline . 
Many visiting dignitaries have applauded the professional conduct of the personnel on parade . 
I congratulate the Battalion for their exemplary military traditions , professionalism and high standards of discipline . R . 
Today you stand on the threshold of a new assignment and I am confident that you will strive to maintain the best traditions of your regiment and Indian Army . 
I wish you success in all your future endeavours . 
I also take this opportunity to welcome 8th Battalion , The Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry ( Siachen ) , one of the most decorated Battalion of the Indian Army to Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
The unit will be relieving 28 MADRAS and taking over an extremely prestigious and honourable assignment as ceremonial Army Guard Battalion at Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
The many laurels , the title of " bravest of the brave” and various battle honours the unit has won , is a testimony of their valour , strong determination , rich traditions and indomitable spirit . 
I am confident that the Unit will continue to strive for excellence with professional zeal and meet the high standards required as the ceremonial Army Guard . 
I wish Col Amit Soni , his team of officers and brave men of 8 JAK LI a successful tenure here at Rashtrapati Bhavan . 
In the end I wish officers , troops and families of both the units , the very best and a glorious future . 
The Nation is indeed proud of you . 
May god bless you all . 
Speech by The President of India at the inauguration of polio conclave organized by rotary international
It gives me great pleasure to join you today in celebrating India’s polio free status . 
The official recognition , by the International Certification Commission that India has effectively immunized its population against polio - that there has not been a single case of polio detected in India in the last three years - is a momentous occasion indeed . 
For a country that was , till only recently , among the worst affected by the virus , this is a landmark achievement . 
Polio eradication has been a priority health objective of the Government of India . 
The realization of this goal was made possible by an unprecedented and gigantic programme undertaken by the Government of India across the length and breadth of our country . 
Government of India and State Governments were supported in this operation by doctors , volunteers , professionals , private enterprises and international organisations . 
They all came together to make that extraordinary , collective effort – which was necessary to wipe out this crippling disease . 
International organisations like the UNICEF , WHO and the Rotary International network contributed with a variety of their human and material resources and best practices . 
To them all , I would like to convey my deep appreciation . 
I would like to congratulate the countless men and women of India who applied themselves with vigour to implement the initiatives taken up at multiple levels . 
They worked persistently to spread awareness , administer the polio vaccine and follow up with surveillance investigations and prompt medical attention , wherever required , to achieve the goal that has been accomplished today . 
In a country like India , where the sheer numbers of our population and access to remote regions is a unique challenge , the fact that the programme reached every corner of our country , that the volunteers were successful in persuading all communities about the importance of immunisation and eliciting their co - operation , repeatedly , for timely administration of the prescribed doses , speaks of the unparalleled dedication of all concerned . 
As I thank the Rotary International for inviting me today , I recall their unyielding advocacy and relentless efforts , over the years , to execute their comprehensive campaign against polio in all parts of our country . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , while we rejoice today , we must remind ourselves of those nations whose battle against the polio virus is not yet over - whose children are yet to be properly protected against it . 
A few weeks ago , on the occasion of India’s completion of three years without polio , I had stressed that our success must make us more vigilant : we will continue to be at risk until the whole world is free of the virus . 
We will need to keep up our watchfulness and preparedness and take all the precautions necessary to ensure that there is no recurrence of this dreadful disease in our country . 
I do believe that as viruses and diseases do not respect borders , it is in our own interest to assist those populations of the global community that are still vulnerable . 
I would like our people to reach out to such countries that can benefit from our success and experience . 
Countries such as Nigeria , Pakistan , Afghanistan , countries in West Africa and even Syria , which are said to be polio infected , can be assisted in so many ways . 
We can share with them the strategies that brought us success and help them improve their own health systems and infrastructures . 
As long as polio virus survives anywhere , it is a threat to all populations everywhere . 
I am confident that we can count on the support of our partners as we join the international community in rooting out the polio virus permanently from the globe . 
The worldwide network of the Rotary International would be an important asset . 
They have demonstrated that civil society can play a key role in supporting and supplementing Government’s efforts to address challenging health issues ; they have set a very good example that will , I am sure , inspire similar partnerships in other areas of healthcare in our country . 
I do believe that every contribution , big or small , to the overall effort will be invaluable . 
With these words , I once again congratulate the Union Ministry of Health , State Governments and all those who contributed to making India polio - free . 
I offer my felicitations to the people of India on this historic day and wish them the best of health and happiness . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the President’s standard / colours presentation to 112 helicopter unit and 4 base repair depot
I am very happy to be present here today at this premier maintenance base of the Indian Air Force to confer Standard ‘112 Helicopter Unit’ and Colours to ‘No . 4 Base Repair Depot . ’
Ever since their inception , these premier establishments have displayed a rich tradition of professional excellence and have rendered distinguished service to the Nation . 
In recognition of their dedication and devotion to service , the Nation honours them this day . 
Indian Air Force has been commendably executing its mandate of protecting the Indian skies and safeguarding the sovereignty of our Nation . 
It has also remained at the forefront of providing relief and aid to our citizens during various natural calamities . 
The resilience and tenacity displayed by the Air Warriors both while undertaking operational commitments as well as during disaster relief contingencies is a great source of strength and also a matter of immense pride for the Nation . 
As our Country progresses ahead on the path of continued economic growth , it is essential that we preserve peace . 
In order to ensure this we need the effective deterrence provided by a strong defence force . 
As a Nation we stand firmly committed to peace , stability and prosperity . 
But should a contingency arise , I am confident that our Armed Forces will valiantly rise to the occasion to meet all the security challenges . 
The Air Warriors , who smartly stand before us today epitomise the grit and determination of our Air Force in fulfilling their responsibilities towards the Nation by upholding the highest standards of service ethos . 
I place on record my deepest appreciation for all Air Warriors of the IAF for their devotion to duty , professionalism and a selfless spirit of service . 
I also take this opportunity to congratulate all the Air Warriors on parade for their impeccable drill and smart turnout which infact reflects the pride which they feel for the Air Force and the Nation . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , 112 Helicopter Unit has an enviable operational history to its credit . 
As one of the first helicopter units of IAF raised in the Eastern Sector , it has served with distinction . 
Not only did it provide exceptional air support to our ground forces during the 1971 operations but its brave Air Warriors have also consistently executed daring high altitude rescue as well as air maintenance missions in the eastern Himalayan Sector . 
As a part of IPKF operations the unit’s personnel flew several daring missions which firmly established their professional credentials and earned them rich accolades . 
The unit is presently handling the important task of training the next generation of our helicopter crews who will handle the future security challenges to our Nation . 
I am confident that the unit will continue to grow from strength to strength in the years ahead . 
No . 4 Base Repair Depot has been handling the important task of providing quality aeroengine maintenance support to many operational fleets of the IAF . 
Upon its inception , the Depot was tasked to repair and overhaul aeroengines for Vampire , Mystere and Toofani aircraft which represented the backbone of our fighter fleet at that time . 
Over the years the unit has significantly upgraded its capabilities by absorbing contemporary technologies and best technical practices . 
Today , the Depot is handling the aeroengine maintenance support requirements for the Kiran trainer , MiG - 27 and the Mirage aircraft fleet . 
The fact that the Depot has till date overhauled over 7650 aeroengines while maintaining an enviable safety record reflects the professional ethos of its Air Warriors . 
I am confident that the unit will continue to better itself and competently address the future transformational challenges for the Air force . 
In recognition of their outstanding performance over the years , I am pleased to award Standard to 112 Helicopter Unit and Colours to 4 Base Repair Depot . 
I’m confident that these Units will continue to strive for excellence with professional zeal and serve the Nation selflessly in the years to come . 
On this occasion , I take the opportunity to compliment all the Air Warriors , Civilians and families of 112 HU and 4 BRD for their dedication and devotion to service . 
The Nation is indeed proud of you all . I wish you and your families the very best and a glorious future . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of the stree shakti puruskar for the year 2013 on International Women’s Day
At the very outset , I would like to extend my warm greetings to all the participants in this year’s Stree Shakti Puruskar Ceremony and through you , I would like to convey my felicitations to all the women of India on International Women’s Day . 
Tribute to all the women of India
As we recognise six outstanding women for their excellence and achievements in the field of social development , I would like to pay tribute to all the women of India who have given the nation their invaluable gift of labour and love . 
As housewives , mothers , teachers of India’s future generations , businesswomen at the grassroots and executives in the top echelons of the corporate world , they have , through their individual efforts , made contributions , big and small to build the India of today . 
As respected professionals in all walks of life , women have , in no less measure , made their mark in the frontiers of science , space exploration and research alike . 
I would like to make a special mention of the women in our agricultural sector - who are the mainstay of India’s food security – and also the scores of women workers who toil shoulder to shoulder with men in building , brick by brick , the mighty physical infrastructure of our country . 
Distinguished participants , as a people with an ancient history , are we always mindful that in our traditional social systems , women were accorded due equality and respect . More than 3000 years ago , our society had sanctioned women many liberties . 
The concept of " shakti” or female energy is a manifestation of the reverence with which women were regarded . Co - education existed and girls had equal opportunities to study . 
India’s history is replete with examples of women having exercised the same rights and powers as men – they have been great administrators as queens and empresses , led armies as warriors , inspired social and religious reforms and fought for the independence of India with utmost courage and determination . 
It is important to remind ourselves of this . 
When India gained her independence , our Founding Fathers were firm in their commitment to provide equal rights for the women of free India . 
When they drafted our Constitution , they duly introduced this principle in its Preamble , Fundamental Rights and in the Directives Principles . 
Their aim was to ensure that forever after , India’s laws , policy framework and developmental plans and programmes should incorporate specific measures for the advancement of the female population . 
As a result , over the decades , Central and State Governments have focused on gender parity in school education and healthcare in both the rural and urban sectors . 
Female literacy , a key element of empowerment , has seen an increase and was 65 . 46 % in 2011 . 
The National Rural Health Mission , Integrated Child Development Services scheme and water & sanitation policies have helped reduce infant and maternal mortality rates
The National Food Security Act of 2013 also includes an important element of maternity benefit . 
It is seen that strengthening local government institutions has brought more than 10 lakhs women into our panchayats and urban local bodies and this is a notable step towards the desired political empowerment of women . 
However , our satisfaction at this progress , though significant , should not divert our attention from the most reprehensible violations of the rights and dignity of women in India by our own people . 
It is hard to comprehend that anyone who has been brought up with Indian values could engage in the savagery that comes to light every single day . 
Despite the numerous legislations enacted and amendments made in the existing laws by the Central and State Governments to safeguard women , there is still much to be done to provide our women and girl children a semblance of the safety and security that a civilized society should guarantee . 
I am aware that the Ministry of Women and Child Development have brought in new legislations such as the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace ( Prevention , Prohibition and Redressal ) Act , 2013 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act , 2012 . 
These initiatives are timely initiatives . 
Similarly , the " Ahimsa Messenger” programme is aimed at preventing violence against women and children and involves women at the grassroots level , women leaders , community workers and adolescent girls . 
I would say that all such initiatives , to achieve their aim , should involve both men and women – especially our youth , giving them a specific role and the responsibility to make it a success . 
Today , more than half our population is of the age group of about 25 years or younger . 
They are more socially aware and are developing a whole new set of value systems . 
This is , therefore a critical target group and we must not lose any time or opportunity to guide them in the right direction . 
When I met you a year ago , I had mentioned that new legislations , no matter how well conceived , must be supported by efficient enforcement mechanisms . 
How are we doing in this regard ? 
Are we , as a society , expeditiously taking up reforms in our police and judicial systems - on a continuous basis ? 
We need to see that crimes against women are seriously investigated and justice is provided in a prompt manner . 
Are we taking concrete steps to ensure that our women have all the wherewithal they need to seek justice and receive it ? 
Are we proactively bridging the disparities by building the required societal and physical infrastructure ? 
Needless to say , legislation , alone , cannot emancipate our women . 
There is a need for a fundamental re - setting of our mental and moral make - up , our civic sense and our social conduct . 
We must do all that we can to revive our tradition of according due honour and respect to our mothers and sisters ; by doing so we will honour ourselves . 
The words of Poet Laureate Rabindranath Tagore come to mind – he had said , and I quote , " Woman is the builder and moulder of a nation ' s destiny . . . . she has a heart , far stronger and bolder than of man . . . . She is the supreme inspiration for man ' s onward march . . . . " . 
As we appreciate these inspiring words , let us apply ourselves , with sincerity , to the goal of bettering the lives and prospects of women and children in India . 
I once again congratulate the Ministry of Women and Child Development and offer my felicitations to the distinguished awardees . 
I am sure that your example and leadership will inspire many . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the 48th convocation of Indian Statistical Institute
It is my privilege to be here today for the forty eighth Convocation of the Indian Statistical Institute ( ISI ) . 
It is a leading institution in our country for research , teaching and application of statistics , natural sciences and social sciences . 
I thank the Institute for giving me this wonderful opportunity to address you on this happy occasion . 
The foundation of this unique institution was laid by Professor P . C . Mahalanobis , who was recognized for his pioneering work in applied statistics . 
He was also known for his economic development model that was followed in India’s Second Five Year Plan . 
In the nineteen hundred twenties , Professor Mahalanobis had a wonderful vision about the potential of statistics in creating a modern society . 
He correctly identified statistics as a key tool for the progress of science and technology . 
He sought to develop the statistical infrastructure in the country . 
In 1931 , he set up in one room of the Presidency College in Kolkata , a statistical laboratory . 
This path - breaking initiative taken more than eight decades back has now become a large institution . 
ISI is today reckoned as a world class academic body in theoretical and applied statistics . 
I have fond memories of my association with ISI when I chaired the Institute’s Council for eight years . 
I note with pride the immense contribution of this Institute in the development of statistical theory and innovative applications . 
ISI has produced outstanding scientists , teachers , researchers , consultants , entrepreneurs , institution builders and other professionals . 
The quality of ISI’s products is a telling evidence of the high standards of education imparted by it . 
The Convocation Day , today , marks the culmination of fruitful educational experience of yet another batch of students from this Institute . 
On this occasion , I see a palpable sense of joy and exhilaration in the students . 
Through the sweet pain of their labour , the graduating students have fulfilled their long - held dreams and that of their well - wishers . 
I congratulate all of you on your success and urge you to play a key role in deciding our country’s path of progress . 
You , the bright future of our nation , have the potential to think differently . 
Apply judiciously what you have learnt here to make a lasting contribution in the field that you have chosen to pursue . 
Statistics , as a discipline , finds wide application in society . 
The modalities of carrying out business and government transactions have undergone a sea change over the last few years . 
Application of data sciences and quantitative decision - making has led to a dramatic change in business and governance landscape . 
Enhanced capability of analyzing large data has had a positive impact on our ability to formulate effective public policies . 
It has helped in improving transparency to ensure last mile connectivity . 
It has facilitated in reaching out to a large cross - section of people for wider service delivery . Improved capacity for analyses of large data sets has also led to an improvement in weather forecasting systems . 
This has resulted in greater accuracy in the predictions of severe climatic conditions . 
During the occurrence of natural calamities , this has accorded us crucial elbowroom to carry out large evacuations and save precious human lives . 
Data mining and statistical techniques have also been used to initiate counter terrorism programmes like the National Intelligence Grid . 
Efforts have been made to introduce statistical systems for estimation and control of fake Indian currency notes . 
I am happy to note that ISI is involved in developing technologies and theories in the areas of cryptology and information security that are likely to have far reaching impact on national security policies . 
The efficacy of our policies , especially in the social sector , hinges on the quality of data collected by different government agencies . 
Good policies call for good data standards . 
Great emphasis must therefore be laid on the authenticity of the information gathered so as to form the basis of policy intervention . 
The Collection of Statistics Act , 2008 seeks to facilitate the collection of data on several socio - economic and other parameters . 
It is the collective responsibility of the citizens and the seekers of information under this Act to ensure that correct and adequate statistics is furnished . 
I am sure our policies will continue to have the imprint of quality data and their sound analyses . 
Statistical and allied techniques are depended upon by business for operational and strategic decision making . 
The corporate sector makes extensive use of Statistics and allied subjects like Mathematics , Economics , Operations Research , Quality Management and Computer Science . 
Data such as usage of social networking sites , footfalls in large retail stores , hits on websites and usage of credit cards are thoroughly analyzed for widely differing purposes like uncovering hitherto unknown consumer behaviour , assessment of risk , detection of fraudulent transactions and discovering new customer segments . 
It is a fact that statistical models and techniques bestow great advantage to the user . 
However , it is prudent to also exercise due caution in analyzing large data and drawing inferences . 
Capturing unstructured data and converting them into a structured format are technically challenging problems . 
They have to be pursued in an enlightened manner . 
Drawing inferences call for adequate scrutiny of the theory requiring the combined knowledge of the statistician and of the subject expert . 
In this context , it is worth remembering what Albert Camus , the French author and philosopher of the last century , had stated , The evil in the world comes almost always from ignorance , and goodwill can cause as much damage as ill - will if it is not enlightened” . 
Big data , analytics and ubiquitous computing have created unique opportunities . 
It has led to an increase in the demand for well - trained professionals in these fields . 
However , as the analytic techniques are complex , they underline the need for a great deal of expertise . 
A large pool of competent statisticians in the country is necessary to support the analytical needs of the public and private sectors . 
Our universities and academic institutions teaching Statistics and allied subjects must take due care to up - grade the standards of instruction . 
I look upon a distinguished institution like the ISI to take the lead in transforming the academic management of this important discipline . 
As a happy coincidence , the calendar of 2014 exactly matches that of 1947 – the year we started our tryst with destiny . 
There were a lot of hopes then and we have been successful to a great extent in realizing them . 
We are today in the throes of attaining global leadership . 
This is possible only through the singular contribution of all our countrymen . 
For that , we must ensure each and every citizen of this country to partake the benefits of progress and prosperity . 
Today , technology provides us the hope to realize this goal . Our manpower provides us the wherewithal to create and administer the technology . 
As you leave the portals of this Institute today , remember that the skills you have gathered through intense training here can create innovative changes in the lives of common folks in our country . 
Your knowledge of economics and quality management ; your ability to gather and analyze large data , can play a significant role in improving the quality of governance and public policy . 
I am confident that as you move ahead , you will not only make an impact on business and technology but also will be empathetic in shaping the destiny of our nation . 
We are all proud of you and nurture high hopes from you . 
Be the worthy citizens of our country . 
With these words , I conclude . I wish you the very best in all your endeavours . 
I also take this opportunity to wish everyone present here a very happy , healthy , rewarding and intellectually satisfying 2014 and beyond . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the unveilling of the photographs of The President of The Central Legislative Assembly and The Portraits of The Former Speakers of The Lok Sabha
I am indeed happy to be present amidst you on the occasion of unveiling of the photographs of the Presidents of the Central Legislative Assembly and the portraits of the former Speakers of the Lok Sabha today . 
As Presiding Officers of our apex elected body , these distinguished personalities made significant contributions towards strengthening the edifice of our parliamentary democracy through their innovative rulings , directions , observations and initiatives . 
As a mark of our respect to these stalwarts , their photographs and portraits have been installed today in this temple of democracy . 
Indian Parliament is the Gangotri of our democracy . 
It represents the will and the aspirations of one billion plus people and is the link between the people and the government . 
If Gangotri gets polluted , neither Ganga nor any of its tributaries can stay unpolluted . 
It is incumbent upon all Parliamentarians that they maintain the highest standards of democracy and parliamentary functioning . 
The Parliament , like other organs of the Government , is not sovereign and owes its origin and authority to the Constitution and derives its functional responsibility from , and discharges its responsibilities within the framework of the Constitution . 
The prime function of the Parliament is to enact legislations to empower the people on every front - social , economic and political , to exercise control over Executive and making it accountable in all respects . 
The validity of a law , whether Union or State , is tested by judiciary as defined in the Constitution . 
Our Parliament has evolved well - developed processes and procedures . 
The Parliament functions through Debate , Dissension and finally Decision and not through disruption . 
In order to strengthen our Parliamentary functioning and other democratic institutions , it is important that all stakeholders – Government , political parties , their leaders and Parliamentarians do some introspection and follow sound parliamentary conventions and rules . 
This historical Parliament House Building is adorned with mural paintings of ancient India along with portraits and statues of national leaders and eminent parliamentarians . 
Presently , the photographs of Presiding Officers of Central Legislative Assembly of pre - independence period have been displayed in the inner lobby of Lok Sabha Chamber in the Parliament House . 
In order to continue this beautiful tradition , it was appropriately decided to have a Gallery of the Presidents of the Central Legislative Assembly and the former Speakers of the Lok Sabha and to install their photographs and portraits in the Outer Lobby of the Lok Sabha Chamber . 
I congratulate the Speaker of the Lok Sabha , Smt . Meira Kumar , for taking this initiative . I also convey my appreciation for the selected artists who have done a tremendous job in painting the portraits . 
In the last six decades and more since Independence , the people of this country have been witness to the constitution of fifteen Lok Sabhas through election on the basis of adult suffrage . 
Every Lok Sabha , as an apex elected body of the country , has successfully guided our nation on the path of progress . 
In response to the unique circumstances every Lok Sabha has faced , the Parliament has evolved as an effective representative institution to meet the emerging challenges of our vibrant democracy . 
By facilitating orderly conduct of business in the House , all the former Speakers of the Lok Sabha have significantly contributed to the effective functioning of the House and to the development of various parliamentary traditions , conventions , processes and procedures . 
This is also the time to remember the distinguished Presidents of the Central Legislative Assembly in the pre - Independence period – Sir Frederick Whyte , Shri Vithalbhai Patel , Sir Muhammad Yakub , Sir Ibrahim Rahimtoola , Sir R . K . Shanmukham Chetty and Sir Abdur Rahim , who laid the solid foundation for India’s parliamentary system . 
Due to the relentless efforts of Shri Vithalbhai Patel , the first elected President of the Central Legislative Assembly and contributions of members like Motilal Nehru and others , the establishment of an independent Secretariat under the President of the Central Legislative Assembly was a turning point in the history of our parliamentary system . 
It was due to his farsightedness and wisdom that when the Constituent Assembly was drafting the Constitution , the founding fathers took cognizance of the importance of having an independent office of the Presiding Officer . 
They very thoughtfully and appropriately incorporated Article 98 in our Constitution which provided for the creation of separate Secretariats for both the Houses of our Parliament . 
As the constitutional and functional head of the House , the Speaker is entrusted with the onerous responsibility of protecting the independence , impartiality , dignity and power of the House . 
Adequate powers are vested in the office of the Speaker through the Constitution , through the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the House and also through the conventions to ensure smooth conduct of the parliamentary proceedings . 
All our distinguished former Speakers of the Lok Sabha , starting from Shri G . V . Mavalankar to Shri Somnath Chatterjee ; and the present Speaker , Smt . Meira Kumar , have adorned the Office of the Speaker maintaining the highest standards of democratic traditions and have made significant contributions in further strengthening our parliamentary conventions , processes and procedures . 
I am delighted to see presence of some of former speakers of Lok Sabha on this occasion and I heartily welcome them . 
I am sure , the photographs and portraits of the Presiding Officers of the Central Legislative Assembly and the Lok Sabha that are being unveiled here today will always remind us of discharging our duties and responsibilities for which we have sought mandate from the people , and inspire us to earnestly strive to establish a progressive , vibrant and healthy democracy . 
Speech by Shri Pranab Mukherjee on his assumption of office as President of India
Members of Parliament
Your Excellencies , Friends and fellow citizens
I am deeply moved by the high honour you have accorded to me . Such honour exalts the occupant of this office , even as it demands that he rises above personal or partisan interests in the service of the national good . 
The principal responsibility of this office is to function as the guardian of our Constitution . 
I will strive , as I said on oath , to preserve , protect and defend our Constitution not just in word but also in spirit . 
We are all , across the divide of party and region , partners at the altar of our motherland . 
Our federal Constitution embodies the idea of modern India : it defines not only India but also modernity . 
A modern nation is built on some basic fundamentals : democracy , or equal rights for every citizen ; secularism , or equal freedom to every faith ; equality of every region and language ; gender equality and , perhaps most important of all , economic equity . 
For our development to be real the poorest of our land must feel that they are part of the narrative of rising India . 
I have seen vast , perhaps unbelievable , changes during the journey that has brought me from the flicker of a lamp in a small Bengal village to the chandeliers of Delhi . 
I was a boy when Bengal was savaged by a famine that killed millions ; the misery and sorrow is still not lost on me . 
We have achieved much in the field of agriculture , industry and social infrastructure ; but that is nothing compared to what India , led by the coming generations , will create in the decades ahead . 
Our national mission must continue to be what it was when the generation of Mahatma Gandhi , Jawaharlal Nehru , Sardar Patel , Rajendra Prasad , Ambedkar and Maulana Azad offered us a tryst with destiny : to eliminate the curse of poverty , and create such opportunities for the young that they can take our India forward by quantum leaps . 
There is no humiliation more abusive than hunger . 
Trickle - down theories do not address the legitimate aspirations of the poor . 
We must lift those at the bottom so that poverty is erased from the dictionary of modern India . 
What has brought us thus far , will take us further ahead . India ' s true story is the partnership of the people . 
Our wealth has been created by farmers and workers , industrialists and service - providers , soldiers and civilians . 
Our social harmony is the sublime co - existence of temple , mosque , church , gurudwara and synagogue ; they are symbols of our unity in diversity . 
Peace is the first ingredient of prosperity . 
History has often been written in the red of blood ; but development and progress are the luminous rewards of a peace dividend , not a war trophy . 
The two halves of the 20th Century tell their own story . Europe , and indeed the world , reinvented itself after the end of the Second World War and the collapse of colonization , leading to the rise of great institutions like the United Nations . 
Leaders who ordered great armies into the field , and then understood that war was more barbarism than glory , transformed the world by changing its mindset . 
Gandhiji taught by example , and gave us the supreme strength of non - violence . 
India ' s philosophy is not an abstract in textbooks . 
It flourishes in the day - to - day life of our people , who value the humane above all else . 
Violence is external to our nature ; when , as human beings , we do err , we exorcise our sins with penitence and accountability . 
But the visible rewards of peace have also obscured the fact that the age of war is not over . 
We are in the midst of a fourth world war ; the third was the Cold War , but it was very warm in Asia , Africa and Latin America till it ended in the early 1990s . 
The war against terrorism is the fourth ; and it is a world war because it can raise its evil head anywhere in the world . 
India has been on the frontlines of this war long before many other recognized its vicious depth or poisonous consequences . 
I am proud of the valour and conviction and steely determination of our Armed Forces as they have fought this menace on our borders ; of our brave police forces as they have met the enemy within ; and of our people , who have defeated the terrorist trap by remaining calm in the face of extraordinary provocation . 
The people of India have been a beacon of maturity through the trauma of whiplash wounds . 
Those who instigate violence and perpetuate hatred need to understand one truth . 
Few minutes of peace will achieve far more than many years of war . 
India is content with itself , and driven by the will to sit on the high table of prosperity . 
It will not be deflected in its mission by noxious practitioners of terror . 
As Indians , we must of course learn from the past ; but we must remain focused on the future . 
In my view , education is the alchemy that can bring India its next golden age . 
Our oldest scriptures laid the framework of society around the pillars of knowledge ; our challenge is to convert knowledge into a democratic force by taking it into every corner of our country . 
Our motto is unambiguous : All for knowledge , and knowledge for all . 
The weight of office sometimes becomes a burden on dreams . 
The news is not always cheerful . 
Corruption is an evil that can depress the nation ' s mood and sap its progress . 
We cannot allow our progress to be hijacked by the greed of a few . 
I envisage an India where unity of purpose propels the common good ; where Centre and State are driven by the single vision of good governance ; where every revolution is green ; where democracy is not merely the right to vote once in five years but to speak always in the citizen ' s interest ; where knowledge becomes wisdom ; where the young pour their phenomenal energy and talent into the collective cause . 
As tyranny dwindles across the world ; as democracy gets fresh life in regions once considered inhospitable ; India becomes the model of modernity . 
As Swami Vivekananda in his soaring metaphor said , India will be raised , not with the power of flesh but with the power of the spirit , not with the flag of destruction , but with the flag of peace and love . 
Bring all the forces of good together . 
Do not care what be your colour - green , blue or red , but mix all the colours up and produce that intense glow of white , the colour of love . 
Ours is to work , the results will take care of themselves . 
There is no greater reward for a public servant than to be elected the first citizen of our Republic . 
It is indeed a privilege for me that my first public appearance is connected with health and is being organized by a premier organization like FICCI . 
The theme , " Universal Healthcare : Dream or Reality " is appropriate and topical . 
Universal healthcare is a dream but at the same time not beyond reality . 
It is incumbent on us that we should bring it within the realm of reality . 
Good health of its people is the very foundation of a nation . 
A person who is not healthy is unable to access opportunities for learning , growth and productive work . 
In India , a number of rights are guaranteed to its citizens but none of these can be utilized or enforced by persons who are sick , enfeebled and spend their entire energy on treatment and medical care . 
At the national level , according to a WHO study , the estimated economic loss for India due to deaths caused by all the diseases in 2005 was 1 . 3 % of its GDP . 
With an increase in the number of non - communicable diseases , this loss is apprehended to increase to 5 % of GDP by 2015 if it is not checked . 
Therefore , a healthcare coverage that assures access to medicines and treatment at affordable prices is an objective , essential for the full utilization of the human resource capacity and one to which India is committed to achieve . 
The task is - how to make this a reality ? 
This goal links up with issues like the mode of funding for healthcare , the extent of coverage to be given ; stakeholders who would be need to be drawn in to make it functional ; how to expand medical education and encourage medical research . 
Different countries have evolved different models for providing healthcare . 
A study of these takes one to the conclusion that a healthcare system would need to be country - specific , and therefore , India would need to look at achieving universal health coverage based on its own perspective and requirements , while bearing in mind the lessons that can be drawn from the experiences of others . 
The delivery of health services in India is by both , the public sector and private sector . 
There is a high variance in the quality of service available as well . 
Some private hospitals provide world class facilities , so much so that people from third countries come here for treatment giving impetus to medical tourism . 
On the other hand , is the lack of access to even basic medical care for many people particularly the poor and disadvantaged . 
Our medical healthcare system has to be developed to cater to medical requirements of all sections of society , both in rural and urban areas . 
The transformation of India ' s health system to be able to provide universal health coverage is a process that will span a period of time . 
A major re - engineering process began with National Rural Health Mission , launched in 2005 . 
It sought to extend healthcare services to every village in the country and to strengthen healthcare infrastructure through sub - centres , primary health centres and community health centres . 
The aim now is to extend the coverage to urban areas also . 
There should be necessary standards of care observed at every level of healthcare . 
A network of healthcare centres has to be established . 
This can be sustained only with adequate number of doctors and other paramedical supporting staff . 
Merely constructing hospitals is not enough . 
It needs the human resources to make them functional and effective . 
Medical colleges , nursing institutions , and training schools for paramedical professions would need to be augmented substantially . 
Shortage of trained medical personnel can be a major constraint for providing universal healthcare . 
Various systems of traditional medicine and healthcare can also augment capacity . 
There are some other features of India ' s healthcare system , which are important steps forward towards widening the coverage of healthcare . 
These include , among others , schemes for mother and child healthcare as well as universal immunization programme , which is among the largest immunization programme in the whole world in terms of the number of beneficiaries and the geographical spread . 
Another issue related to universal healthcare is the question of its affordability . 
Medicines account for 72 % of private expenditure of health . 
India has taken a major decision on distribution of free generic drugs to patients seeking healthcare in public facilities . 
This will bring down out - of - pocket expenditure and provide affordable access to medicine , particularly for the poor and disadvantaged . 
Implementing this requires funds as also efficient management systems . 
State Government of Tamil Nadu has developed a successful model using an IT enabled management system . 
In today ' s era technology based initiatives including telemedicine can be employed to broaden the reach of healthcare . 
Then there is the question of funding . 
Government looks at scaling up expenditure of health from the current level to 2 . 5 % of GDP by 2017 i . e the end of 12th Plan and 3 % by 2022 i . e end of 13th Plan . 
Government , singularly , cannot be a provider of healthcare . 
While the aim is to strengthen the public healthcare sector , we should look at ways to encourage cooperation between the public and private sectors in achieving the health goals . 
All stakeholders have to be a part of the effort to provide universal healthcare . 
From the pharmacists to the doctors , from industry to drug manufacturers , from medical insurance to management of hospitals and running of primary health centres , all have a role in the success of the health system . 
The potential of India as centre for medical research and innovation given its academic , scientific , technical and industrial capabilities should be fully explored . 
It will be incorrect if we were to look at health coverage only in terms of curative and interventionist approach . 
Preventive healthcare is equally important particularly in India where the number of those suffering from diabetes and cardio - vascular diseases is on the rise . 
Our health system , therefore , will need to treat people and , at the same time , advise and guide them about how to deal with and prevent some of these medical conditions . 
Hygiene and sanitation are basic for preventing diseases . 
In these efforts , participation at the local level particularly at the village level through Panchayati Raj Institutions can ensure effective implementation . 
I am sure that this Conference will comprehensively look at all these and many more inter - related issues for making available accessible , affordable and effective healthcare to people . 
Speech by The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of the presentation of National Awards to Teachers
You represent the dedicated men and women from all over India , who have brought education and learning to our generations . 
It is indeed a pleasure to be here with you on Teachers ' Day . 
I extend to you my hearty felicitations . 
Teachers ' Day is celebrated on the 5th of September , the birth anniversary of my pre - eminent predecessor , Dr . Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , who was one of the great scholars and philosophers of our country . 
When he became the President of India in 1962 , his admirers requested him to allow them to celebrate his birthday . 
Dr . Radhakrishnan , who himself was an accomplished teacher , said , " instead of celebrating my birthday separately , it would be my proud privilege if the 5th of September is observed as Teachers ' Day ' ' . 
It is my privilege to join you in paying tribute to him and all teachers on this occasion . 
Our gurus down the ages - from saints and seers of Vedic times to Swami Vivekananda , Rabindranath Tagore and Gandhiji - have bequeathed a unique legacy to us which has nourished our minds and intellect . 
In more recent times , among many others , scholars like Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman , Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Amartya Sen have contributed to the development of Physics and Economics and laid down theories that have been recognized , accepted and acclaimed throughout the academic world . 
I salute all these savants ! 
To build India of our dreams , the first and foremost task before us is to improve the quality of Education . 
In a nation whose demography is young - both in age and spirit , teachers have the responsibility of providing education which is rich in values and modern in content . 
Having been a teacher myself , I have always drawn inspiration from these words of Swami Vivekananda " Education is the process by which character is formed , strength of mind is increased , and intellect is sharpened , as a result of which one can stand on one ' s own feet . 
And that a teacher ' s sacred duty is to invoke the spirit of inquiry in his pupils . " 
I still cannot find better words of inspiration for the teaching fraternity . 
Your sacred duty is to enable your pupils to construct knowledge , to discover their own talents , and to develop their physical and interpersonal skills , cognitive abilities and subject - matter expertise . 
Education must enrich their minds , broaden their horizons and give them ever lasting hunger for exploring new ideas and vistas of opportunity . 
As teachers , we all know that educational activities and learning processes are no longer confined to classroom - based curriculum . 
It is necessary to design appropriate learning experiences for the students . 
Development of a scientific temperament is essential . 
Adaptation to and application of new technology has to be an integral part of the curriculum development for all stages of education . 
New methods and teaching aids must equip the younger generations to learn more , explore more and contribute more to the society . 
As I have said elsewhere , I firmly believe that Education is the true alchemy that can bring India to its next golden age . 
Our motto should be : All for Knowledge , and Knowledge for All . 
With the Right to Education in position , our country has set itself the goal of Education for All by 2015 . 
As teachers , you are critical to this endeavour . 
No person should be deprived of the precious opportunity to learn , broaden her thinking and explore new horizons . 
Every person must have a deep understanding of our country and its heritage and the capability to think about her responsibility and duty towards the nation . 
As Gandhiji taught us , it is the " right education " rather than mere knowledge of facts that is really needed to make a democracy function . 
This calls for the strengthening of our teaching cadres by well - trained , motivated teachers involved in continuously improving education programmes , fully responsive to the changing needs of the students . 
Teachers should give themselves a new orientation and evolve an enhanced institutional capacity . 
Qualified and competent teachers , continuously renewing their capabilities and excellence through research , experimentation and innovation would be the nation ' s strength . 
We must work for the long term goal of setting performance standards and creating top class institutional facilities for innovative training and professional development of teachers . 
I expect that the Government of India ' s National Mission on Teachers and Training will address all these urgent priorities and the related issues in a holistic manner . 
In this context , I take the opportunity to recognize the efforts of the private sector and of non - governmental organizations who have taken some excellent initiatives in extending education . 
They have demonstrated that so much is possible if the task is taken up with commitment and sincerity . 
I also take this opportunity to recognize , with deep appreciation , the professional dedication with which you all have played a commendable role in making our nation a confident , vibrant and modern India , whose citizens are recognized for their scholarship and intellect and contribution to society . 
To those of you who are being recognized with awards , I offer my felicitations . 
To all of you , I wish success in your future endeavours . 
Through you , I extend my warm greetings to the entire teaching community in the country . 
Before I conclude , let me share a thought with you . 
When I think of a teacher , an image comes to my mind : 
I see a lighted lamp surrounded by a thousand unlit lamps . 
The lighted lamp ignites all those thousand lamps who in turn go away and ignite thousands of other lamps and I see the widening circle of light dispel all the darkness in our motherland . 
You are those lamps . 
Go and spread light . 
I wish you God speed . 
Speech by The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the valedictory function of sesquicentennial celebrations of The Madras High Court
It gives me great pleasure to be in Chennai today to deliver the valedictory address on the occasion of the 150th anniversary celebrations of the High Court of Madras . 
The Madras High Court has an illustrious history . It was one of the three Courts established in India by Letters Patent issued by Queen Victoria after the Calcutta High Court on July 1 , 1862 and Bombay High Court on August , 14 , 1862 . 
The historical context in which the Madras High Court was established merits a recall . 
The death of Tipu Sultan and the fall of Srirangapatanam in 1799 eliminated the only Indian kingdom of the South that challenged the British . 
By the mid 1800s , the power of the British was running high with a direct impact on the growth of the East India Company ' s operations in India . 
Consequently , the Company rapidly gained strength as a political power . 
To dispense justice in an organised and centralised manner , the company started the process of unifying the judicial system with the establishment of the Supreme Court of Madras in 1801 and subsequently , the merger of all Courts of Law into the Madras High Court on August 15 , 1862 by Letters Patent issued under the Indian High Courts Act , 1861 . 
It is interesting that the High Court of Madras was formally inaugurated on August 15 , 1862 , exactly 85 years before India attained Independence . 
The Madras High Court has many firsts to its credit . 
It was this Court which had the first Indian , Sir T . Muthuswami Ayyar , appointed as a Judge of a High Court . 
The first Indian Advocate General , Sir V . Bashyam Iyengar was also from here . 
Madras High Court was the first to have an Indian Chief Justice , Dr . P . V . Rajamannar , who served for over 13 years . 
The Madras High Court was a pioneer in the enrolment of women . 
B . Ananda Bai and Seeta Devadoss joined the Bar much before women were permitted to appear in other Courts of law in the country . 
As a matter of fact , I can trace a very special connection between Calcutta and Madras . 
It was Sir Sankaran Nair , a member of the Madras Bar who fought for the autonomy of Calcutta University when the struggle was on between Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee and Sir Henrey Shaw . 
He later became an Advocate General before getting elevated to the Bench . 
This was recollected by no less a person than Dr . Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , the then President of India on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of this very High Court on 6th of August , 1962 . 
Yet another connection that Calcutta had with Madras High Court was the appointment of a member of the Madras Bar , Eardley Norton as the Special Public Prosecutor in the famous Alipore Bomb blast case in which Shri Aurobindo was one of the accused . 
Though Eardley Norton was a barrister of the Madras Bar , the British Government had hired his services as a Special Public Prosecutor in the year 1908 for this case . 
There was yet another connection - Sir Frederick William Gentle was the Chief Justice of this Court when India attained independence . 
Before being appointed as the Chief Justice of this Court , he rendered valuable service as a puisne Judge of the Calcutta High Court from 1941 - 47 , after serving here as a puisne Judge from 1936 - 41 . 
The High Court of Madras has an unusual architectural feature , a 175 feet high Tower of the Light House overseeing the city of Chennai . 
This tower symbolizes the role this High Court has played for over a century and a half . 
It has been a guardian and a watch tower for the rule of law , seeking to secure for our citizens justice - social , economic and political - as enjoined in the preamble to our Constitution . 
The High Court of Madras has , over the years , earned fame as an institution of high standards with strong traditions and ideals . 
Its Bench as well as Bar has been well known for legal erudition and intellectual acumen . 
Independence and fairness has been its hallmark . 
Land mark decisions of this Court have contributed greatly to the strengthening of the legal and constitutional framework of our country . 
Many luminaries from the Madras Bar have contributed to the national movement and politics of independent India . 
Sir C . Sankaran Nair was Advocate General , then judge and finally Member of the Viceroy ' s Council . 
He abandoned the Membership in the Council and joined the Indian National Congress and became its President in 1897 . 
Shri C . Rajagopalachari or ' Rajaji ' as he was popularly known , had a successful career in law at this Bar , before he gave up practice and plunged into the freedom struggle . 
Rajaji served as Governor General of India from June 21 , 1948 to January 26 , 1950 . 
My eminent predecessor , Shri R . Venkataraman , was also member of this Bar and went on to serve the country in various capacities such as Minister of Finance , Minister of Defence , Minister of Home Affairs and Vice President of India before becoming the President of India from 1987 to 1992 . 
Sir C . P . Ramasamy Iyer is a name etched in our memory . 
He not only had a lucrative practice and later became the Advocate General of this Court , he was also the leader of the Home Rule Movement along with Dr . Annie Besant . 
Shri V . Krishnaswami Aiyar is another name that deserves to be recalled , both for his contribution to this Court as well as to society at large . 
He was a close friend of Gokhale and Surendranath Banerjee and highly respected by Sir Phirozeshah Mehta , all of whom represented moderate views of independence movement . 
Other legal luminaries recognized for their brilliance over the years include Sir T . Muthuswami Iyer , Sir C . Madhavan Nair , Justice M . Pathanjali Sastri , who later became the Chief Justice of India , Sir V . Bashyam Ayyangar , Shri T . R . Venkatarama Sastri , Shri T . R . Ramachandra Ayyar , Dr . Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar and in more recent times , Shri M . K . Nambiar and Shri Govind Swaminathan . Shri K . Parasaran and G . Ramaswamy from this Bar have served as Attorney Generals and Shri V . P . Raman and Shri K . K . Venugopal as Solicitor Generals of Independent India . 
Special mention also deserves to be made of Mohan Kumaramanglam , a leading criminal lawyer of the Madras Bar , who served as Minister for Iron and Steel Mines before passing away at a young age . 
Lawyers of the High Court like V . L . Ethiraj , Shri Subbaraya Iyer and Shri P . S . Sivasamy Iyer , have also made contribution to the spread of education in the state by setting up several top class educational institutions . 
The illustrious lawyers and Judges of this Court have also contributed to nation building and advancement of social justice . 
The case filed by Champakam Dorairajan paved the way for the first amendment to Article 15 of the Constitution . 
Clause ( 4 ) enabling the State to make special provisions for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward class of citizens or of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was inserted in Article 15 of the Constitution by the first Constitutional Amendment Act 1951 , after the decision in this case . 
Similarly , the insertion of the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution for grouping legislations that would fall beyond the pale of judicial review was the brain child of a member of Madras Bar , Mr . V . K . Thiruvenkatachari , who served as Advocate General for 13 years . 
When legislations relating to Zamindari abolition and land reforms were struck down by the Patna and Calcutta High Courts as unconstitutional and violative of Articles 14 and 31 of the Constitution , Shri Thiruvenkatachari suggested the insertion of Ninth schedule and the inclusion of the legislations regarding land reforms in this schedule . 
Let me now turn to some of the issues that dominate the legal discourse in our country today . 
The independence of our judiciary is widely recognized and a matter of pride for every citizen of our country . 
The Indian Judiciary has enlarged the scope of fundamental rights , increased the space for democracy , while maintaining the quality of justice delivered . 
We must do everything possible to preserve and protect the independence of our judiciary from any form of encroachment . 
At the same time , the judiciary , as an important pillar of democracy , must also keep reinventing itself through a process of introspection and self - correction . 
The separation of powers , long established as one of the basic features of our Constitution , ensures that each organ of government operates within its own sphere and none takes over functions assigned to the other . 
It is the Constitution that is supreme . 
The laws are enacted by the legislature , the executive does the implementation , and the judiciary is the final interpreter of these laws . 
The delicate balance of power enshrined in the Constitution should be maintained at all times . 
Our judges , through innovation and judicial activism have contributed enormously to expanding the frontiers of justice and providing access to the poorest of the poor of our country . 
Taking into account the special circumstances of a developing country , our Supreme Court has expanded the common law principle of ' locus standi ' when it comes to violation of the fundamental rights of our citizens . 
A post card or newspaper article has been sufficient to trigger the intervention of the Courts in support of individual rights . 
Today , our Courts permit any person , acting with bona fide and having sufficient interest in maintaining an action for judicial redress for public inquiry , to put the judicial machinery in motion . 
However , a note of caution needs to be sounded . Judicial activism should not lead to the Constitutional principles of separation of power getting eroded . 
Judicial pronouncements must respect the boundaries that separate the Legislature , Executive and Judiciary . 
The principle of separation of powers is equally a principle of restraint . 
While the exercise of powers of the legislature and executive are subject to judicial review , the only check on the judiciary ' s exercise of powers is the self - imposed discipline and self - restraint . 
Judging the judges is a delicate and sensitive topic and one which has been viewed with some concern by jurists . 
Legislation which carefully balances the independence of the judiciary with the need to protect and preserve its credibility is a useful complement to the judiciary ' s own efforts . 
Ultimately , the credibility of the judiciary will depend on the quality of the judges who man the various Courts of the country . 
Therefore , the process of selection and appointment of judges should conform to the highest of standards and should be based on well established principles . 
Justice delayed is justice denied . Administration of justice must be quick and accessible to all . 
Despite various challenges , the judiciary in India is working hard to reduce back - log of cases and provide speedy justice . 
Our courts must be strengthened with additional resources and the Government is fully engaged in this task . 
A National Mission for Justice Delivery has been launched . 
The Constitution is being amended to raise the retirement age of High Court Judges and efforts are underway to create an All India Judicial Service . 
The filling of vacancies in courts across the country is a matter that must be taken up as a priority by all concerned . 
We must make haste in this regard but without compromising on quality . 
The judicial system in our country should not only be accessible but also affordable . 
The fact that litigation is time consuming and expensive is well known . 
To address this , alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration should be encouraged . 
This will help ensure timely and effective justice , and ease judicial pendency . 
The judiciary has a crucial role to play in the administration of the Legal Services Authority Act which has multiple objectives . 
Greater efforts are also needed to spread legal literacy across the nation . 
Article 39A of the Constitution provides that : 
" The State shall ensure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice , on a basis of equal opportunity , and shall in particular , provide free legal aid , by suitable legislation or schemes in any other way , to ensure opportunities for securing justice are not denied by reason of economic or other disabilities " . 
The Government , judiciary and lawyers through their voluntary efforts must make this Constitutional dictum a living reality for the common man . 
Improving the quality of legal education and inculcating the right values in aspiring and young lawyers is the need of the hour . 
Lawyers of Madras , have unhesitatingly accepted judicial office even if it involves substantial monetary sacrifice . 
Bar Associations of the Madras High Court have also utilised their knowledge and expertise to assist in the development of the law . 
The Madras Bar has provided valuable inputs on many bills and legislation , such as the Code of Civil Procedure and the Criminal Procedure Code . 
This is certainly a tradition worth emulation by other Bar Associations of India . 
The great traditions and vitality of the Madras High Court exemplify the high sense of duty that has animated the judiciary and the legal profession of this state . 
I am confident that the Madras High Court will continue to uphold its glorious heritage of 150 years . 
It will enhance its contributions to the development of law , justice and jurisprudence . 
It will at the same time ensure that administration of justice continues to be carried on with dedication and commitment to the common man . 
I congratulate the Hon ' ble Judges , members of the Bar and the staff of the Madras High Court for their past achievements and wish them the very best in their future endeavours . 
Speech by The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the banquet in honour of The President of The Palestinian National Authority of The State of Palestine , H . E . Mr . Mahmoud Abbas
It is , indeed , a great pleasure to extend a warm welcome to Your Excellency , and to the distinguished members of your delegation on your State Visit to India . 
Your visit is another important step in further strengthening the time tested friendship , solidarity and co - operation that have always characterised relations between India and Palestine . 
India ' s commitment to Palestine was given voice by none less than Mahatma Gandhi in the days of India ' s own struggle for independence . 
As early as in 1936 , ' Palestine Day ' , to mark our solidarity , was observed in India . 
In the early years of independent India , our policy and support for the Palestinian cause was consolidated under the leadership of our first Prime Minister , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru . 
We were the first country outside the Arab world to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization , in 1975 , as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people . 
In March 1980 , we accorded recognition to the PLO Office in New Delhi - just two days prior to the first official visit of Chairman Yasser Arafat to India . 
Soon after that , India recognized the State of Palestine in 1988 - after which we opened our Representative Office to the State of Palestine in 1996 . 
India has been consistent and persevering in its commitment to the Palestinian cause . 
In the United Nations , the Non Aligned Movement , and in other international fora , India has always supported the Palestinian people in pursuing their legitimate aspiration for a sovereign , independent and viable State . 
India wishes to see your realisation of a State of Palestine , with East Jerusalem as its capital , existing within secure and recognised borders side by side and in peace with Israel . 
Towards this end , India has underlined its support for the Arab Peace Initiative and the Quartet Road Map ; we have repeatedly called for the implementation of relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly . 
I heartily commend the indefatigable spirit of the Palestinian people and take this opportunity to reaffirm India ' s principled and unwavering support to their just cause . 
We have always considered the conflict in West Asia to be political in nature and therefore we believe that it cannot be resolved by force . 
India fully supports your efforts to be a member of the United Nations
Our envoys and representatives have worked together to achieve the goal of Palestine ' s membership of UNESCO . 
Very recently , as a member of the heritage committee , India supported Palestine in having the holy Church of Nativity in Bethlehem recognised as a World Heritage Site . 
India has been proud to assist the Palestinian people in their continuing endeavour towards nation - building . 
We have seen , with satisfaction , the positive outcome of grants and resources shared by us over the decades for your developmental projects , creation of educational and training facilities , capacity building and humanitarian relief . 
I was also happy to learn that you have inaugurated the new Palestinian Embassy building in New Delhi earlier this evening . 
This is a proud moment in our diplomatic history - and your Embassy will ever be a monument to the co - operation and enduring friendship between our two countries and our peoples . 
Your visit to India has yet again been purposeful and productive , an occasion to review our bilateral agenda , strengthen our co - operation for mutual benefit and to renew our commitment to achieving our common goals in the years to come . 
With these words , Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen , I request you to join me in raising a toast : 
To the good health and success of His Excellency President Mahmoud Abbas , President of the Palestinian National Authority ; 
To the prosperity and progress of the State of Palestine and its friendly people ; and
To the abiding friendship and co - operation between India and Palestine . 
Speech by The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the 58th annual convocation of IIT Kharagpur
I am happy to join you today on this occasion of the 58th Convocation of IIT Kharagpur - in the Diamond Jubilee year of this proud institution . 
I recall my visit here in 2011 when the celebrations were launched . 
From its very inception , IIT Kharagpur has been infused with a pioneering spirit . 
Perhaps this is due to it being housed in a building hallowed by some of India ' s great freedom fighters . 
The original location of this Institute is the very spot where two great soldiers of the freedom movement - Santosh Kumar Mitra and Tarakeswar Sengupta , had served their sentence . 
It is recalled that when they were shot dead by the Police of the day on Sept . 16 , 1931 , Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose himself came to the Hijli detention camp , as it was known , to take charge of their mortal remains . 
This incident had galvanised national leaders including Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore
It is recorded that in 1946 , a Committee had been set up by Sir Jogendra Singh , Member of the Viceroy Executive Council , to consider setting up higher Technical Institutions for post war industrial development in India . 
However , it was in independent India , in August , 1951 , that the first batch of just 24 students and 42 teachers started their lessons in a total of ten Departments . In March , 1952 , Pandit Nehru laid the foundation stone of the new IIT Kharagpur and subsequently , on September 15 , 1956 , the Parliament of India passed an Act known as the Indian Institute of Technology ( Kharagpur ) Act , declaring this Institute as an Institute of national importance . 
Since then , this Institution has grown steadily in prestige and accomplishment - to become the incubator , then model , for modern technological education in India . 
The IIT system , which started from here , is a symbol of the progress and success of India in the field of technology . 
The reputation and achievements of the IIT system are due , in great measure , to its superior programmes and curriculum , designed to remain true to the fine vision of its founders
I can think of no better words than the IIT motto , " Yoga Karmashu Kaushalam " or " Excellence through perfection " to inspire modern generations with the seminal guidance given by Sri Krishna to Arjuna in the Mahabharatha . 
The Mission of the IIT Kharagpur " To draw the best expertise in science , technology management and law , to impart overall training to students in visualizing , synthesizing and executing projects , and to inculcate in them a spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation " : is bound to create excellence . 
And the vision that has guided the management and faculty is at the core of its success : " To be a centre of excellence in education and research , producing global leaders in science , technology and management " , " To be a place where knowledge is created in frontier areas of national and global importance " . 
These guiding principles , if pursued sincerely , will be invaluable in creating the national asset of a highly qualified and motivated generation with an advanced scientific temper . 
Today , the IIT ' s alumni are achievers and leaders in every sphere of human activity - in India ' s most successful corporates and Government Ministries and in laboratories of research and innovation here and across the world - cherishing their IIT background and bringing home laurels . 
The country is proud of your contribution - in creating the technological manpower essential for our nation - building and your noteworthy contribution to the economic growth of our nation . 
It was in recognition of your service to the nation that our Government was pleased to announce , in the Union Budget of 2011 - 2012 , a one time grant of 200 crore rupees for the development of IIT Kharagpur . 
Government of India also approved the establishment of a 400 - bed hospital within this IIT to be built on a ' Special Purpose Vehicle ' model , - which is another unique privilege for IIT Kharagpur . 
Nehruji had , perhaps , foreseen this day when he said , in his convocation address in this institution in 1956 - and I quote , " You will find in a country technologically developed , how Engineers and Scientists play a far more important role even outside their sphere of Engineering and Science . 
That is right and that is bound to happen in India . 
In a time of changing social and industrial needs , it is a welcome initiative that IIT Kharagpur is offering new degree courses and programs in order to lead from the front and to keep pace with the growth and development of science and technology . 
I am happy to see that this IIT , apart from creating scientific and technical knowledge , has taken measures to meet the challenges of this century : establishing new postgraduate programmes in Energy Engineering , Nano Science and Technology , setting up a School of Bioscience with emphasis on cellular and molecular biology and a School of Environmental Science . 
It is also a matter of satisfaction to see that the Institute will soon start a Medical Education Programme and take a research initiative in Bio - medical and Heath - care in the proposed Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy Institute of Medical Science and Research
I am glad to note that IIT Kharagpur has taken the lead in setting up unique departments , schools and centres for studies in Agricultural Engineering , Rural Development and Mining Engineering , keeping in mind the priority requirements of the all sectors of our economy - and especially the eastern states of India . 
The School of Medical Science and Technology and Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law are good initiatives indeed . 
At the same time , I feel it necessary to share with you my sense of dismay on seeing , in recent reports , that not a single Indian University or institute of higher learning , including the premier IITs figure in list of 200 top rated Universities of the world . 
Now you may question the survey , but to my mind the more important question is , why ? Why are we , a " rising economic superpower " , not able to promote our standards to be rated , indisputably , among the top ten or even top fifty or hundred ? 
I AM glad and welcome in this regard the Vision 2020 document of IIT Kharagpur and its pledge that it will strive to become one of the top 20 Institutes in its class in 20 years . I wish you all success . 
I would stress that to realise our true potential as a nation , it is necessary to start now , with the urgent task of developing , in our students , a scientific temperament . 
It is necessary to design , without delay , appropriate learning experiences for our students . 
Development of advanced technology at competitive costs would be a boon to our industry , trade and commercial sectors . 
Adaptation and application of new technology to Indian conditions and requirements would open new market opportunities . 
These have got to be an integral part of the courses that our students attend - and they must be continuously stimulated in their quest for answers and solutions . 
There must be more collaborations and exchanges and cross pollination of ideas with the best minds in India and abroad . 
There is no reason why the most modern methods and teaching aids should not be made available to our teachers and students . 
Our younger generations should be encouraged through all means to learn more , explore more and contribute more to the society . 
You are critical to this endeavour . 
I would stress that IITs , as leaders , have the responsibility of ensuring the continuous revitalization of their institutions through research , experimentation and innovation . 
The long term goal of setting standards and creating top class facilities and for the training and professional development of your teachers should be a priority . 
While offering my felicitations to the successful students who will receive their degrees today , I would remind you that your satisfaction at having completed the challenging course should also invoke in you a strong desire to do more . 
I would expect that you will today commit to channelise your creative energies to contribute in an exceptional and significant way to the national goals of inclusive growth and sustainable development in all sectors . 
Creation of jobs should always be among your priorities when you conceive concepts and ideas . 
Your efforts and initiatives could go a long way in supplementing Government ' s efforts and initiatives to provide cost - effective and novel methods and technology - adapted to the current , changing needs of our society . 
The projects and plans conceived here can open new avenues and means for our rural population and middle class to make them increasingly productive , self - reliant and give them opportunities that they can confidently pursue . 
I firmly believe that your future success will not only be measured by the outstanding education and training that you have received here but also by the values with which you will define your work and your adherence to the principles that the Founding Fathers of the IIT system conceived . 
You have a tremendous responsibility . I call upon each one of you to rededicate yourself to making the " Decade of Innovation " , an unmitigated success . 
Pandit Nehru ' s thoughts which he shared here in the 1956 convocation , come to my mind , that " There is no greater joy in life than to work for a great purpose and gradually to see the realisation of that purpose . . . . " 
With these inspiring words , I once again offer you my hearty congratulations and my best wishes for a bright future . 
Speech by The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the banquet in honour of The President of The Republic of Burundi , H . E . Mr . Pierre Nkurunziza
It is with great pleasure that I welcome you and the distinguished members of your delegation on your first State visit to India . 
India values its friendship with Burundi . 
Your visit to India is an occasion for our Governments to meet at the highest level and take up initiatives that will bring our people closer together in mutually beneficial programmes and partnerships . 
It is an opportunity to lay the foundations of a comprehensive co - operation , for sharing resources and expertise , building capacities where you would seek it and reviewing all aspects of our trade and investment potential . 
Since the opening of your Embassy in New Delhi in 2009 , there has been a significant expansion of our bilateral agenda . 
We look forward to working together with you towards realising its full potential . 
The Joint Declaration that has been issued today outlines the future course of our partnership . 
We appreciate your fruitful efforts that have brought peace and stability to your people . 
We are confident that in your drive against poverty and underdevelopment you will accomplish the goals that you seek . 
India stands ready and willing to join hands with the people of Burundi in pursuing their aspirations for development and growth . 
There is great potential to further strengthen bilateral trade and investment between our two countries . 
New areas of economic co - operation and investment are opening up . 
These need to be pursued systematically to the mutual benefit of our peoples . 
India ' s developmental experience , particularly in energy , agriculture , infrastructure , minerals and in the development of small scale industries and capacity building are ideally suited to generate employment for the youth . 
We believe that this could be of relevance to Burundi ' s socio - economic development . 
The Kabu hydro electric project , similarly , is a symbol of our commitment to assist you in capacity building and infrastructure development in Burundi . 
I am pleased that bilateral agreements signed today relate to many of these key sectors - including rural development , health and medicine . 
The Indian community in Burundi , though small , is already involved in many of these sectors . 
This is a critical period of your transit from political emancipation to economic development . 
It coincides with India ' s own recalibration and re - vitalisation of its policies towards Africa . 
We have recently organized two India - Africa Forum Summits , in 2008 and 2011 . 
At these Summits , Government of India has announced several projects in response to specific requirements for accomplishing Africa ' s urgent aspirations . 
These summits have provided a matrix for enhancing India ' s relations with African nations including Burundi . 
Your leadership at the Second Africa - India Forum Summit held in Addis Ababa in May last year as Head of the East African Community was instrumental in its substantive outcome . 
India is glad to know that the Pan - African e - network project has been found useful by Burundi . 
We have been happy to assist with training programmes and scholarship schemes for under - graduate and post - graduate studies in agriculture , science and scientific research . 
We are willing to do more - wherever you require it . 
I understand that we have further increased the number of scholarships for students from Burundi and agreed to establish educational institutions for capacity building . 
We acknowledge the growing role of your country in the regional affairs of Africa . 
Burundi has been actively engaged in achieving peace and stability in Somalia . 
Your contribution to peace - keeping in Darfur , in Chad and in the Central African Republic has been generous . 
We are keen to further develop our engagement with the EAC . 
India and Burundi have been working together in various international fora including the United Nations and Non - Aligned Movement . 
We share a common commitment to pluralism , inclusiveness and creation of an equitable world order . 
We are confident that you will support our endeavours in the reform of the UN . 
We welcome your support for our candidature for permanent membership of an expanded UN Security Council . 
I have no doubt that our bilateral cooperation in the new areas that have been identified during your present visit will bind us even further in an enduring partnership . 
I wish you every success in your current initiatives and future endeavours for the people of Burundi . 
With these words , Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen may I request you to join me in raising a toast : - 
To the health , happiness and well - being of His Excellency President Pierre Nkurunziza and Madame Bucumi Nkurunziza ; 
To the well - being and prosperity of the people of Burundi ; and
To lasting friendship between India and Burundi . 
Speech of The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the 18th convocation of The University of Kashmir
I am delighted to be here at the 18th Convocation of the University of Kashmir . 
This is a long awaited and proud moment for those who will receive their degrees . 
Some of you will receive awards for your meritorious work . 
I offer you all my felicitations and congratulations . 
Although you will leave the portals of this Institution , you will henceforth be bound to it as the Alumni of a very prestigious University - the University of Kashmir with a glorious tradition of intellectual and literary activity . 
I am told that this University , with 13 faculties in 38 teaching departments and 15 research and extension centres , offers about 150 academic programmes today . 
It has come a long way from its modest start in 1948 . 
I am deeply conscious of the great standing of Kashmir as the Sharda Peeth - the ' Seat of Learning ' - in ancient times . 
This beautiful valley has nursed in its lap great men of letters , poets and patrons of learning . 
It has also attracted philosophers and scholars from diverse cultures and foreign civilizations who contributed to its rich heritage . I am sure that students and faculty of the University have a sense of the rich legacy that they have inherited and will derive inspiration and benefit from it . 
The academic environment in India and , indeed , across the world is more exciting than ever for students of today . 
he IT revolution has brought infinite opportunities . 
It has greatly facilitated us in offering a more modern , progressive and relevant education to our students . 
Government of India , in its 12th Five Year Plan has a well defined strategy to achieve this . 
It includes expansion of infrastructure with regional equity , focus on performance , better human resource management , reform of the curriculum , promotion of quality research and creation of an environment that will attract the best talent . 
I am aware that University of Kashmir is electronically linked with knowledge banks and information offered by reputed Institutions across the world . 
This needs to be disseminated with optimal efficiency . 
This is the time to shift towards increasingly interactive , and collaborative learning experiences . 
New technologies need to be adopted which have useful applications for teaching , learning and professional growth . 
This will bring a significant improvement in the quality of our teaching and research
Universities must promote creativity and innovation . 
Creation of a knowledge society requires that Universities encourage autonomous research . 
It is equally important to have collaborations and linkages between premier institutions of higher learning in India and abroad for cross fertilization of ideas and advancement of knowledge . 
As I take in the beauty of Kashmir , I am compelled to prioritise the preservation of its ecology and environment in the minds of our students and researchers . 
This is as an area where Universities such as yours could make a great contribution for your own benefit and that of future generations . 
There is an urgent need to make students duly cognizant of the visible effects of climate change and the general degradation of our land , freshwater and marine resources . 
In Kashmir itself , a lot needs to be done to safeguard the immediate environs - and to evolve an academic curriculum and research to address the challenges . 
I would also like to take this opportunity , while I am among the bright young people here today , to highlight the relevance - and the urgent need for greater tolerance in our society . 
No problems are ever resolved by violence . 
It only aggravates the pain and the hurt on every side . 
The healing process must be nurtured with love , compassion and patience . 
Institutions of higher education , with their emphasis on sound value systems and character building can play an effective role in developing a greater sense of responsibility and a rational approach to all issues . 
In this context , the duty of teachers is to inculcate in their students a balance - of knowledge and skills with the moral and aesthetic values . 
I call upon the youth of Kashmir to take the lead in forging the future of our nation . 
In every field of activity - be it business , industry , trade , education or culture , India is a nation on the move . 
A billion people marching forward led by the ideas , enterprise and energy of its predominantly young population . 
I am confident that the young people of India will build a strong and powerful nation - a nation that is politically mature and economically strong , a nation whose people enjoy both a high quality of life as well as justice , fundamental rights and equality . 
This India of tomorrow , achieved through inclusive growth , offers enormous opportunities for the youth of Kashmir if they only seize them . 
Do not lose any more time . The whole world is rapidly transforming itself . 
We in India should not be left behind . 
The contributions of young Kashmiris are critical for India ' s advancement to progress . 
Let the dark days of violence and conflict be left behind . 
Let a new dawn emerge . It is the time to move ahead with faith in our collective future and confidence in the largest democracy in the world , where rule of law prevails , robust institutions function and the Constitution serves as the Supreme Law . 
I am aware that there are grievances . 
Many important issues need deft handling and speedy resolution . 
The Government of India and the State Government of J & K are determined and duty bound to ensure that every Kashmiri lives with dignity having equal rights and equal opportunities . 
Let Jammu & Kashmir lead the way in the building of a new future for India . 
Let it set an example to the rest of India and the world by showing how the entire region can be transformed into a zone of peace , stability and prosperity . 
Let Jammu and Kashmir regain its historical role as a center of learning , a place frequented by saints and religious scholars , a land known for its diversity and harmony , a fulcrum of trade and commerce with our neighbours . 
With these few words , I once again congratulate the scholars and students of the University of Kashmir on this important occasion as you enter a new chapter of life ' s lessons and experiences . 
May it be pleasant and rewarding . 
May you proceed to achieve greater distinctions and higher levels of achievement for yourselves , your proud parents and your society . 
I look forward to your contribution - each one of you - to the building of our great nation . 
Extracts of remarks by The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of call on by the students of Tamana Special School
Dr Shayama Chona , Founder of Tamana , Educators and the Students of Tamana Special School , I am pleased to welcome you here today . 
This is indeed a special occasion as it gives me the opportunity meet and encourage a group that represents the differently abled . 
Students of Tamana Special School , you are very special children - of courage and determination . 
I have no doubt that the curriculum at Tamana must be challenging but I am certain that it is geared towards developing your strengths and sharpening your skills . 
The training that you receive will help you in overcoming impediments to develop your aptitude . 
It will make you skilled in various ways and , above all , it will help you to become self - reliant . 
Once you have this independence , no force on earth can stop you or will ever be able to take away from you your abilities and your learning . 
You will have the blessing of self - esteem and confidence and the happiness of being a productive member of society . 
I recognize , with appreciation , the initiative of Dr Shayama Chona , founder of Tamana and her dedicated team of professionals . 
You have together established and developed a very comprehensive programme of education , training and outreach which is now a network spread over several specialized centres . 
I am aware that my predecessor , President Abdul Kalam inaugurated the Autism Centre in 2003 . 
I am pleased to see that this has since grown in strength with many state - of - the - art facilities . 
I am also aware that the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Department of Social Welfare of the Government of Delhi have recognized Tamana and have been supportive to you in your activities and initiatives . 
I understand that there is a carefully planned curriculum for the different age groups , for children from less privileged sections of society and ' open ' schooling for disabled and out - station attendees . 
Equally impressive is the ' ' residential independence training " - as well as the day care facility being provided to these children . 
I am also very happy to learn that Tamana takes care to provide opportunities to the children for their recreation and creativity . 
The training of parents and care givers is always critical as they can supplement or destroy the good work done by the professionals . 
A formal training is invaluable in sensitizing them on how they may give the best possible support to the special children . 
I am sure that Tamana must be giving this aspect due attention and providing regular programmes to help them to do their part . 
I would always emphasise that along with teaching , emphasis should be laid on research and collaboration between institutions so that there is a regular cross fertilization of ideas and upgradation of knowledge and skills . 
It is important for teachers to receive training and constantly update their methods . 
Hence I am glad to see that you have a teachers ' training programme . 
Dr Chona , I do see in the children and the educators around me a high level of motivation and enthusiasm . 
Your institution has set a high standard which other institutions can follow . 
I congratulate you on your dedication and your achievement . 
I am sure that your organization will grow from strength to strength as you provide a holistic developmental education to children with special needs . 
With these words , I thank you all for your visit and offer you my best wishes for a bright and productive future . 
Speech of The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the function organised by help age India on the occasion of International Day of Older Persons
I am extremely happy to address this gathering on the occasion of the International Day of Older Persons . 
Let me at the outset itself confess my bias . I turn seventy seven few months from now . 
Our Honourable Prime Minister has just celebrated his 80th birthday . 
Ms . Lata Mangeshkar celebrated her 83rd birthday a few days back . Justice V . R . Krishna Iyer is going strong at the age of 97 , intellectually vibrant and deeply concerned about the welfare and progress of our nation . 
Many more illustrious persons can be added to this list , but I stop here . 
There is in this audience and all around us a large number of elders who are making extremely valuable contributions to our country and to our society . 
I salute them and am proud to be one of them , an ' Elder ' leading a productive and fruitful life . 
And , I am confident that each one of these elders has much more to do and give before they call it a day . 
Today , with the advancement of medical science and technology , age is by no means a disabling factor . 
If you are healthy , age is just a number . 
It is also possible to remain young in mind and spirit irrespective of how many moons you have seen . 
As summed up by the famous English writer , W . Somerset Maugham " Old age has its pleasures , which , though different , are not less than the pleasures of youth " . 
Yet , it is the sad truth that elders such as those mentioned above are perhaps a minority . 
It is said that there are over a million persons in the world crossing the threshold of 60 years every month . 
The World Bank believes there is an old age crisis looming large over most countries of the world . 
It is with the specific intention of focusing attention on the problems of the elderly that the United Nations declared October 1 as the International Day of Older Persons . 
Across the world , while there is rejoicing over the fact that progress in medical science and economic development has expanded the life span of human beings , there is also recognition that ageing is amongst the major economic and political challenges of the 21st century . 
India is a young nation and we celebrate the fact that more than 50 % of our population is under the age of 25 . 
We are hoping that the demographic dividend that a young population brings will assure our country ' s economic future . 
However , we must remember that there is a very significant population of elders in our country , whose needs cannot be overlooked . According to a forthcoming UNFPA report , 20 per cent of our population is going to comprise of elders by 2050 . 
We simply cannot afford to neglect or ignore this section of the population . 
The India of our dreams is a kind , caring and compassionate society . 
Our Constitution , in Article 41 , which forms part of the Directive Principles calls upon the State to make effective provision for public assistance in cases of old age , within limits of its economic capacity and development . 
I wonder how many other Constitutions would contain such specific reference to the State ' s responsibility to provide support to the elderly . 
Though the Directive Principles do not enjoy the status of Fundamental Right and are not legally enforceable , these principles are considered fundamental in the governance of the country making it the duty of the State to apply them while making laws in order to create a just society . 
I have to confess my deep alarm and dismay in this context over the findings of the 20 city survey conducted by Help Age which reveals that one out of three elders have faced abuse . 
It is even more shocking to learn that those surveyed describe their sons and daughters in law as the primary abusers . 
Many report such abuse as having continued for more than five years and most do not complain to any one in order to uphold family honour . 
Elders surveyed have spoken of suffering disrespect , neglect , verbal abuse , physical abuse , and emotional abuse . 
Worst of all , the Survey finds that the most abused are those above 80 . 
I hope these findings will serve as a wake - up call and goad each one of us into immediate action . 
We must do everything possible to ensure that our elders can live a life of dignity , enjoying the best of medical attention , economic security as well as emotional stability . 
Our culture , history , traditions , religion and philosophy all enjoin us to respect our elders and to fill their lives with abundant love and affection . 
India is what it is today because of the contributions made by our elders in their youth . 
If those hands steadied you when you learned to walk , then you need to support them when they need help and hope there will be others who will do the same for you when you grow old . 
The majority of older persons in our country are women and among the oldest , 65 percent are women . 
Sadly , 58 % of the older women are widows . This gender dimension to ageing is something we should recognize and address with appropriate measures . 
I was very pleased to see earlier the elderly " Maasis " from Kolkatta who are being taken care by HelpAge India . 
Across India , the ' Joint Family " is withering away and with it , the informal support structures that elders used to enjoy . 
This has serious implications for the economic , health , emotional and physical security of the elderly segment of our population . 
These challenges should be seen in the context of industrialization and modernization , which has affected the family size , structure and its guiding philosophy . 
We certainly cannot set the clock back but we must evolve solutions that strike a balance between conflicting demands of elderly and younger members of the family . 
The real challenges that lie in the field of health security are accessibility and affordability of medical health facilities . 
Elderly require special geriatric care which can be available only in the tertiary hospitals and their medical expenses increases with age whereas their income decreases or remains static despite increase in inflation . 
Private hospitals are reluctant to provide concessions to the elderly and insurance companies unwilling to insure the elderly . 
I am thankful to NGO ' s like HelpAge India which provide health care to more than a million elderly every year through their Mobile Medical Vans . 
In the economic field , the full play of market forces in the financial markets has resulted in lowering of interest rates . 
Interest is the mainstay of the income of many elderly who do not get any regular pension but invest their resources in such deposit schemes that yield secure returns . 
The Government of India in 1999 , which was the International Year of Older Persons adopted a National Policy on Older Persons . 
This is a comprehensive document that identifies principal areas of intervention and action strategies . 
his policy needs to be implemented in full earnest by the Government . 
NGOs like Helpage India and older persons ' organizations must provide necessary support to the Government in this regard . 
There is an urgent need to mainstream issues concerning the aged and ageing in India . 
The needs and requirements of the elderly should not be overlooked by society . 
We need to fight ageism that is so deeply ingrained in the societal psyche and reinforced by the media . 
Elderly should not be considered a spent force and consigned to the history books but seen as active members of the society contributing to its well - being . 
Society and government should be sensitized to the fact that old age is just another phase of life with its special needs and characteristics like childhood and youth . 
Though the losses in this phase of life are more than in any other phase in life but still all is not lost . 
The younger people should get to know how the world appears to the elderly ; because that is the future of the youth . 
Most importantly , the elderly should be encouraged to get out of a ' retirement mentality ' and think about old age as a second inning , an opportunity to complete so many unfinished tasks and expand horizons , to look beyond the self and the family and work for community . 
Active participation and involvement in society is the mantra which can ensure independence , dignity and self - fulfillment . 
A compassionate and caring society values each of its members . 
If the youth have energy , the elderly have knowledge and experience . 
All we need to do is provide them opportunities to be productive . 
Under no circumstances should elders in our society be given the impression that they are a burden and that we are reluctant to care for them . 
We need to ensure their happiness and we certainly need their blessings . 
On this occasion of the World Elders Day , I greet all the senior citizens assembled here and pray that all of you will enjoy good health and remain blessed with a mentally as well as physically vibrant life . 
I congratulate all the awardees present here and express my sincere appreciation for the stellar work undertaken by them . 
I compliment Help Age India ' s visionary founder late Samson Daniel who founded this organization way back in 1975 , his successor Shri M . M . 
Shabharwal who spearheaded the expansion of Help Age India across the country and all its members , volunteers and supporters who have dedicated their lives to the service of the elderly . 
I call upon each and every citizen of India to do their utmost to ensure the welfare of the elderly in our country and to create opportunities for them to enrich our society and contribute to the growth and progress of our nation . 
I am particularly happy there are many school children from Delhi schools in the audience . 
Children , I hope that each one of you will pledge to bring the maximum possible happiness into the lives of your grandparents and all others of their generation . 
I would like to end my observations with a quote from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow - 
For age is opportunity no less
Than youth itself , though in another dress
Speech of The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of The Seventh Meeting of Women Speakers of Parliament on Gender - Sensitive Parliaments
I am delighted to join you in inaugurating the 7th Meeting of the Women Speakers of Parliament on Gender Sensitive Parliaments . 
It is particularly opportune that this 7th Meeting is being held in India . 
More than 65 years ago , Indian women stood shoulder to shoulder with freedom fighters to fight for self - governance and demand that Indians should participate in making the laws that applied to them . 
Once we achieved independence , an important goal was to achieve the empowerment of women . 
The principle of gender equality is enshrined in the Indian Constitution in its Preamble , Fundamental Rights , Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles . 
The Constitution not only grants equality to women , but also empowers the State to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favour of women . 
Within the framework of a democratic polity , our laws , development policies , plans and programmes have aimed at women ' s advancement in different spheres . 
From the Fifth Five Year Plan ( 1974 - 78 ) onwards there has been a marked shift in the approach to women ' s issues from welfare to development and in recent years , the empowerment of women has been recognized as the central issue in determining the status of women . 
Our law makers realized that as long as the women of India did not participate in the making of policy and in self - governance , their social status would not improve . 
But although attempts were made more than two decades ago , it was only in 2010 that the Upper House of the Parliament of India took the historic step of passing a bill to reserve a third of all legislative seats across the country for women . 
The bill was passed by 186 votes to 1 . It was a momentous occasion . 
The 73rd and 74th Amendments ( 1993 ) to the Constitution of India have provided for reservation of seats in the local bodies of Panchayats and Municipalities for women , laying a strong foundation for their participation in decision making at the local levels . 
One - third of the seats in local bodies are now reserved for women . 
With this step , 800 , 000 women were brought into the political process in a single election . 
This is very significant as the gram panchayat , is in my view , the best training ground for future parliamentarians . 
At present women constitute 11 percent of the 15th Lok Sabha . 
This is a vast improvement from only 5 percent in the 1st Lok Sabha . 
But although the percentage of Indian women parliamentarians has increased over the years , it is still lower in comparison to countries like Sweden , Argentina , the UK and the USA . 
I am sure that it is a matter of time before the number will be increased significantly . 
Of course , we should remain cognizant of the fact that gender equality and sensitivity is not guaranteed simply by the presence and number of women in parliament . It depends on a parliament ' s level of recognition of the importance of gender sensitivity , its responsive policies and infrastructure . 
It is obvious that a gender sensitive parliament will have a greater success in achieving gender equality and prioritising subjects important to women . 
They would have a better understanding of the issues related to water , fuel , food and income and deal with them with the urgency they deserve . 
A gender sensitive parliament can address , more insightfully , the social problems that women face - which are a blot on society - such as violence against women , female foeticide , trafficking of women and minor girls , their abuse and exploitation and the lack of medical and nutritional care of rural women to name a few . 
Similarly , it can safeguard more effectively women ' s rights to land , leadership , opportunities and choices . 
Sustainable economic and social development can best be spearheaded by well - designed initiatives involving women leaders . 
With access to and control over productive resources such as food banks and cooperatives , and programmes related to health campaigns and nutrition awareness , women now have the wherewithal to take collective decisions on the way these should best be implemented in their area or jurisdiction . 
By increasing rural women ' s leadership and participation in decisions that shape the laws , policies and programmes that affect them , we can enable them to take charge of their own futures . 
Government of India , through its Finance Ministry , has introduced Gender Budgeting to ensure that in all financial outlays there is a specific element or component that is meant for the benefit of women in India . 
This has been successfully implemented across the sectors and every line Ministry is required to report on their execution of the gender budgeting stipulations . 
This needs to be taken further . 
I fully agree that making parliaments more gender sensitive should be one of the primary preoccupations of Parliaments across the globe . 
Poet Laureate Rabindranath Tagore had said : 
" Woman is the builder and moulder of a nation ' s destiny . . . . she has a heart , far stronger and bolder than of man . . . . She is the supreme inspiration for man ' s onward march . . . . " 
The Parliament of India has been graced by many brilliant women representatives who have enhanced the quality and content of discussions . 
I take this opportunity to pay tribute to them and thank them for their contribution to the shaping of the India of today , and their legacy . 
Women have a unique perspective of problems and a great aptitude for innovative solutions . 
And that is why I anticipate that this conference will undoubtedly generate a significant amount of positive energy and many far reaching initiatives . 
This will be an occasion to exchange information and best practices . 
Distinguished Delegates , I congratulate you on your leadership and commitment to creating a more gender sensitive parliamentary environment . 
I look forward to the outcome of your work in this conference . 
I congratulate Smt Meira Kumar , Speaker of the Lok Sabha for her initiative to host this conference in India . 
While I may not have the opportunity to meet each one of you , I wish you great success in your work over the next two days and assure you of my unstinting support . 
Speech by The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the 4th convocation of Lalit Narayan Mithila University
It is indeed my privilege to be here at the convocation of the Lalit Narayan Mithila University . 
You are fortunate and privileged to have been educated at this University - which is the brainchild and result of the collective efforts of the eminent academicians of the time , Dr . Amarnatha Jha , Dr . R . C . Mazumdar , Dr . A . S . Altekar , Dr . Sunit Kumar Chaterjee . 
Darbhanga is the heartland of Mithila and universally acknowledged as the centre of learning of ancient philosophy . 
It was from this region that saints and philosophers , men of art and craftsmen travelled out and inspired the world with their learning , wisdom and compassion . 
It is but natural that the Lalit Narayan Mithila University will imbibe and impart this legacy to its students . 
I am glad to note that since it was founded in 1972 , the University has come a long way . 
It has developed 23 teaching departments , 43 Constituent Colleges and 36 affiliated colleges and even provides distance learning . 
I am told that the University has a collection of nearly one lakh rare books and manuscripts . 
As I glanced at the vision of the " Vision 2011 " of the University , I was struck by its pragmatic choice of priorities : to establish a Women ' s Institute of Technology imparting teaching in Bio - Technology and Information Technology , to promote export of Makhana , to promote the teaching of Mithila Art & Craft - especially Mithila painting , to establish an Institution of Disaster Management , to upgrade Distance Education , establish an Institute of Rural Technology and establish an Institute of Forensic Science . 
I was glad to note that the University plans to build on regional specializations , provide students with the kind of knowledge and learning that would provide them a variety of opportunities . 
Over 70 per cent of Indians will be of working age in 2025 . 
Our young demography is an asset and we should prepare this population for their future role by giving them a solid foundation . 
For this , increasing the availability of accessible and affordable higher education and providing training in vocational skills is a key requirement . 
Government has been providing special grants to recognise excellence in universities and academic institutions . 
A National Skill Development Council has been established and given a mandate to create 15 crore skilled workers by 2022 . 
A National Innovation Council has been set up to prepare a roadmap for innovations in India . 
The process of setting up State Innovation Councils in each State and Sectoral Innovation Councils aligned to Central Ministries is underway . 
A National Knowledge Network ( NKN ) will link 1500 Institutes of Higher Learning and Research through an optical fibre backbone . 
Government of India , in its Approach to the 12th Five Year Plan , will continue with a threefold strategy of expansion , equity and excellence for higher education . 
It has identified revitalisation of the State Universities and Colleges as a critical component of the Plan . 
Academic reforms will be prioritized and strengthening of research activity in Universities by establishing mutually - reinforcing linkages between teaching and research will be undertaken . 
Technology - enabled learning , and collaborative , information and communication technologies ( ICT ) will be an area of focus . 
To improve the quality of education and learning , Government is proposing pilot projects of Innovation Universities giving them considerable autonomy and freedom and supplementing these with the creation of Centres of Excellence in existing universities . 
Resource constraints will make it difficult to meet the need of expanding higher education entirely through the public sector . 
Private investments in higher education , including through PPP - models will be encouraged . 
While all these initiatives indicate that it is an opportune time for higher education in India , we have to be mindful that in the increasingly competitive international environment of today , it is necessary for our Universities to ensure that the curriculum is carefully crafted . 
They should ensure that the courses that they offer are relevant , modern and progressive . 
Government of India has prioritized the promotion of quality by focusing on performance , curricular reforms , better human resource management , promotion of quality research and the creation of conducive ambience in order to attract the best talent to its faculty . 
It is equally important for Universities to give importance to autonomous research . 
It is necessary for Universities to build linkages and collaborations with premier institutions in Indian and abroad . 
Their governance , too , should be guided by flexibility and dynamism . 
Finally , how does a University develop in our youth a well rounded intellect and a personality that is in harmony with society ? 
An interdisciplinary approach will undoubtedly give a proper value orientation to our educational system . 
It is important to simultaneously develop moral values along with a scientific temper . 
I am inspired by the words of Dr Rajendra Prasad who while addressing the Patna University Convocation in 1953 said - and I quote , " education is in one sense a process of acquainting and enriching every new generation with the accumulated experiences and knowledge of a past generations and thereby enhancing the capacity and power of their reason " . 
I would only add that , there is , today , a real need for each and every student passing through the portals of this prestigious institution to remind himself , as he receives his degree , of the high expectations that society has of him and his generation . 
Each one of you should have a deep sense of purpose and commitment to make your individual contribution to the building of your State and our nation . 
Along with the accolades that you will enjoy should be a sobering thought - about what you will do to make a difference - and what will be your significant effort for the people around you . 
I call upon you all to individually and collectively think about this as a noble obligation . 
I once again congratulate the scholars and students who have been awarded medals , certificates of merit and distinction and I hope that your training and education from this esteemed institution shall help you face challenges of the competitive world , that you will contribute in your own way towards the progress and prosperity of the nation . 
God bless you all . 
Speech by The Hon ' ble President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inaugural function of The 7th Edition India Chem 2012
It is a pleasure to be here today for the inaugural function of India Chem 2012 . 
The theme for this year ' s event , ' Emerging India : Sustainable Development of the Chemical Industry " underscores the importance and the role of the chemical and petrochemical industry in the Indian economy . 
It also underlines , very appropriately , that this growth has to be sustainable . 
I am glad to see the enthusiastic participation from diverse regions of India and the world . 
There is today a global focus on sustainability in the chemical industry . 
Increasingly , leaders in the chemical industry are rebooting , using the latest technology to make their enterprises ' green " inspired by Gandhiji ' s words , " be the change you want to see " . 
India Chem 2012 is being held at an opportune moment . 
It is an occasion for all involved in this sector to be informed of global trends , exchange views on green chemistry and showcase their own products and capabilities . 
I am confident that the Indian participants have much to share and significant achievements to display . 
I am equally confident that interaction at the Conference would sensitize the foreign delegates about the various opportunities offered by India in this sector . 
Virtually all sectors of the economy are closely connected if not directly dependent on the chemicals sector for their sustenance . 
This sector provides them a variety of raw material and key input in the form of chemical products and enabling technical solutions . 
The chemical industry is also one of the most diversified sectors . 
As it covers thousands of commercial products , this sector is the mainstay for the industrial & agricultural development of the country & provides building blocks for several downstream industries , such as textile , paper , paint , soap , detergent , pharmaceutical , varnish , etc . 
Similarly the petrochemicals and plastic industry is making significant contribution to many sectors , including agriculture , horticulture , and healthcare and construction industry . 
The development of the chemical industry in India today is , therefore , a key requirement for her progress . 
Along with its key consumer industries , this industry , is increasingly locating its units in Asia . 
The share of Asia in the global chemical industry has increased from 31 % to 45 % between 1999 and 2009 . 
With Asia ' s increasing contribution to the global chemical industry , India emerges as one of the focus destinations for chemical companies worldwide . 
The global chemicals market is estimated at about US $ 3 . 4 trillion . 
The Indian chemical industry is currently estimated to be about US $ 108 billion , that is 3 % share of the global market . 
his is a very good reason for policy makers and industry to take the lead and prepare a roadmap . 
The accelerated growth of this sector should be a priority given the talent pool and current untapped demand within the country . 
A key factor in its accelerated growth would be research . 
I am told that at present the R & D expenditure in this sector is only about 1 - 2 % of turn - over . 
This needs to be addressed . 
It is in the larger and long - term interest of the industry to increase its spending on R & D to about 5 - 6 % of the total turn - over . 
The aim should be to bring new products that are competitive in the international market . 
For achieving this , Govt . of India has taken several pro - active steps in expanding Research and Development and infusing energy and support for Human Resource training institutions . 
Efforts should be made to nurture the talent and make sure that the skill development programme matches the growth requirement of the industry . 
Our National Manufacturing Policy envisages increasing the share of manufacturing from the present level of 16 % to 25 % in GDP by 2025 and creation of 100 million additional jobs by the manufacturing sector by 2022 . 
The Chemical sector has a very important role to play in this endeavour . 
I understand the National Chemical Policy is currently under preparation and will include measures to facilitate this . 
I would like to emphasize , that along with growth , the industry must also ensure increased adherence to safety and international health and environmental standards . 
The industry must also promote sustainable development by investing in technologies that safeguard the environment and stimulate growth while balancing economic needs and financial constraints . 
New technologies are evolving for tackling the problem of industrial waste and the Indian industry should optimally utilize them . 
The Indian chemical industry would need to set targets and standards and take up research and collaborations without delay . 
This is an occasion for the industry representatives in the fields of Chemicals and Petrochemicals from across the world to come together to share their vision for the future growth of the industry . 
I am confident that this three day International Conference would result in fruitful deliberations on all issues concerning the chemical industry from both domestic as well as global perspectives . 
I thank the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals , Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers , Government of India and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( FICCI ) for their initiative in jointly organizing this event . 
With these words , I have great pleasure in inaugurating India Chem 2012 . 
Address of The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of the presentation ceremony of FIEO ' S " Niryat Shree " and " Niryat Bandhu " awards
It gives me immense pleasure to present the " Niryat Shree " and " Niryat Bandhu " Awards instituted by the Federation of Indian Export Organisations for outstanding performance in exports . 
I am sure that these awards would inspire other entrepreneurs in this important sector of the economy to contribute even more vigorously to the economic development of the country . 
I understand that apart from entrepreneurs , exporting companies , Public Sector Banks and the Export Promotion Council , which have rendered support services for the development of exports , have also been awarded . 
I congratulate all of them too . 
Exports have a very important role to play in the economic growth of our country . 
The contribution that this sector makes to employment is of utmost importance to our vision of equitable and inclusive growth . 
The export sector is also important as it is a medium to project India in overseas markets as a source of quality products . 
Exporters , therefore , must remember that their products encase not only the image of their company or their brand but also , more importantly , the image of India as a source of top quality products . 
We must , therefore , at all stages of the value chain imbibe the mantras of quality consciousness , professionalism in service delivery and complete transparency and fairness in our dealings with our trading partners . 
India ' s external trade , that is , merchandise exports plus imports , as a proportion of the GDP has more than doubled , from less than 20 per cent at the turn of the last Century to around 45 per cent in recent years . 
The country ' s financial integration with the world has also been as rapid as its trade globalisation . 
As a broad measure of globalisation , the ratio of the total external transactions i . e . gross current account flows plus gross capital flows to the GDP has also more than doubled from under 50 per cent to nearly 120 per cent during the same period . 
Despite a considerable increase in domestic savings rate , there has been a significant increase in the dependence of the economy on the inflow of foreign capital . 
It has contributed to the financial intermediation of resources in meeting the growing need for long - term and risk capital , as well as technology for the Indian industry . 
It is a matter of satisfaction that India ' s exports registered a 5 fold increase in the last decade from US $ 44 . 6 billion in 2000 - 01 to US $ 251 . 1 billion in 2010 - 11 . 
The compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of India ' s exports which was 8 . 2 % in the 1990s increased to 19 . 5 % during 2000 - 01 to 2008 - 09 . 
India ' s share in global exports also increased from 0 . 7 % in 2000 to 1 . 5 % in 2010 . 
Its ranking in the leading exporters improved from 31 in 2000 to 20 in 2010 . 
The period of high growth in India from 2003 - 04 to 2007 - 08 was accompanied by considerable diversification in its export basket and its export destinations with countries in Asia and Africa gaining ground relatively over USA and Europe . 
This diversification helped in maintaining a momentum in export growth in the period after the global financial crisis in 2008 , even as the demand for Indian exports in the developed countries was adversely impacted . 
After a growth of 13 . 7 per cent in 2008 - 09 , export growth ( in USD ) was a negative - 3 . 5 per cent in 2009 - 10 followed by a strong growth of over 40 per cent and over 21 per cent respectively in 2010 - 11 and 2011 - 12 . 
However , notwithstanding its growing resilience , the experience in more recent months suggests that as India ' s globalisation deepens , it too cannot escape from the impact of developments abroad . 
The creeping unfolding of the Euro zone crisis has impacted the economy through lower growth , falling business sentiments , declining capital inflows and exchange rate , stock market volatility and attendant implications for investor confidence . 
Moreover , the slowdown in external demand has led to significant deceleration in the growth of exports since November 2011 , with export growth becoming negative in three of the first six months of the calendar 2012 . 
Even as one awaits the recovery of demand in the developed economies India needs to maintain the focus of its trade policy on developing new export markets in the emerging and the developing countries where growth prospects in the medium - term remain considerably better than in the developed countries . 
In a globalised world the collective response of countries would need to be coordinated for bringing about an upturn in the growth prospects of the world economy and to address issues of transparency , accountability and regulation of financial markets . 
India has been a part of these efforts , working closely with the international community , to restore growth and to reform financial systems . 
For sustaining domestic growth , the Government has been taking monetary and fiscal measures . Our financial systems are strong and several steps to considerably enhance liquidity in the market have been taken . 
Measures have also been put in place for export incentives and credit facilities . 
I believe Indian exporters have the necessary competitiveness and diversification to operate in a challenging global environment . 
I am confident about the prospects of the Indian economy , which continues to be one of the fast growing economies of the world , and also that our export sector will be a part of this growth story . 
To encourage our exporters , FIEO and other business organizations along with the Government could help in exploring new markets . 
In addition , we must focus on products of high export intensity which are currently having a low penetration in overseas markets . 
Suggestions from the Export Promotion Councils in this regard may be invited . 
An interactive and coordinated approach is particularly important in these times of global stress . 
In conclusion , I once again congratulate all the award winners . 
I compliment Shri Anand Sharma , Commerce & Industry and Textiles Minister and his Ministries for their continuous efforts for the sustained development of the export potential of our economy . 
I am sure that the export sector will continue to contribute to the balanced economic and social development of our country . 
We must all work together to take India to newer heights . 
Working together , with innovation and dynamism , we can realize our collective destiny to be a great nation . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of the inauguration of 26th Conference of Accountants General
It gives me great pleasure to be amongst you today on the occasion of inauguration of the 26th Conference of Accountants General . 
The Accountants General of the States and their equivalents in the Centre are important functionaries assigned with the task of being watchdogs of public finance . 
I am happy to note that the theme of this year ' s conference is " Strengthening Professional Practices " . 
eing a knowledge based organisation , it is important that the practices followed by the department are continuously updated and universally and fairly applied . 
The institution of C & AG is an important part of the governance and accountability structures of our country . 
Its existence underpins and highlights the necessity for accountability of public expenditures by public authorities towards Parliament which represents the Supreme will of the people of this country . 
One of the main instruments through which Parliament exercises this accountability is the office of the CAG . 
It is in recognition of this role that the CAG has been assigned constitutional status by our founding fathers . 
A constitutional mandate for the CAG also reflects the high value that we have placed on integrity and transparency in our public life . 
All public servants in this country are first and foremost accountable to people . 
The rationale for whatever decisions that we take must be empowerment and welfare of our people . This is absolutely fundamental for any democratic system . 
There will be moments in a nation ' s life when institutions would appear to be under stress but as long as we have faith in our basic democratic values and the supremacy of our people and Parliamentary processes , we shall be able to tide over any crisis that we may face . 
From the time we opened up our economy in the Nineties , Government has had to take many decisions of far reaching import the results of which are becoming visible only now . 
Financial sector and social sector reforms do not deliver overnight and their full impact on a country ' s economic and social well - being is felt only over extended periods of time . 
Most such reforms also involve use of public money and public resources . 
Optimal use of such resources by balancing conflicting demands on such public resources has always been the challenge for the decision makers in all sectors and in all parts of the world . 
In a country like India , public administrators have , in addition , the onerous responsibility of actively ameliorating the conditions of the poor and the needy as soon as possible . 
As I stated at the time of assuming the office of the First Citizen of our country , trickle down theories of growth will no longer work in the Indian context . 
When we talk about optimal decision making , we will do well to keep in mind that , in the long run , use of public money must improve the living conditions of the people . 
Governance during the last six decades has become much more complex . 
Public expenditure has increased manifold , newer delivery mechanisms have had to be thought of and brought in to reach services to the people . 
The range of governmental activities itself has changed manifold . Before independence , administration was colonial and mainly responsible for revenue collection and law enforcement . 
With independence and introduction of the planning process , Governments - both at the Centre and the States - took upon themselves many responsibilities that were unthinkable previously . 
Governments built factories , roads , ports and public infrastructures . 
They also directly provided services like health and education . 
The thrust on developmental administration from a purely revenue earning and law and order centric administrative system represented a major paradigm shift . 
Another major paradigm shift is taking place today . 
We have realised that governments alone cannot do everything . 
As a result , we have many players who are responsible for public expenditure and for delivering services - not only the Central and State Governments but also local bodies , registered societies and NGOs etc . 
Given the scale of funding required , particularly for infrastructure financing , Public Private Partnerships ( PPPs ) have emerged as part of the institutional framework . 
They represent recognition by the Government of the need to engage with the Private Sector in diverse areas for the purpose of ensuring broad - based and sustainable growth . 
This has introduced great complexities in funds flow , expenditure , accounting and evaluation . 
In our efforts to reach services to the poor and the needy in the remotest corners of our country , we have had to develop faster channels of service delivery . 
There have been occasions when the system was not fully developed , the process of accounting not fully operational , the local officials who handled government money not fully skilled in their multifarious functions . 
This is , however , a reality we need to accept and a situation we need to address through continuous capacity building and upgradation of human skills . 
I am happy that the C & AG for the past several years has taken a positive approach on this and has not hesitated to offer his helping hand to governments and local bodies in building up and enhancing skills in financial management . 
Your department has developed considerable expertise in financial management through your exposure to different organizations . 
It is in the fitness of things that the expertise available should be utilised fully . 
I hope you continue your efforts in this direction . 
Public audit , I am aware , is just one aspect of financial administration . 
What is most important is that we must introduce a robust internal control system in all spheres of government activity . 
Many significant steps have been taken . 
Ministry of Defence has , for example , worked out detailed " Defence Procurement Procedures " for capital procurement . 
The ' Public Procurement Bill ' 2012 has been introduced in the Lok Sabha . 
Several state governments have now established full - fledged Internal Audit departments within the Government . 
The Union Ministry of Finance is currently examining the Report of the Working Group set up to strengthen ' Internal Audit Mechanisms ' in Government of India . 
I am sure that the recommendations , once accepted by the Government , will go a long way in making Internal Audit an effective tool of governance and internal control , thereby complementing the role of the CAG . 
All these are significant steps towards transparency and good financial administration . 
Equity and justice , fairness and transparency , therefore , continue to be cornerstones of our polity . 
India is once again on the cusp of change . 
The transformational agenda that we have boldly undertaken requires innovation and performance . 
It requires huge resources but , more importantly , it requires judicious use of these resources so that we get the optimal outcome from these resources . 
Every institution in the government must reorient themselves for these momentous changes and must be ready to contribute . 
I am glad that during the past years , CAG ' s audit has shifted from routine compliance audit to a more macro perspective . 
I must , however , stress that while redefining organisational roles and boundaries , all constitutional authorities need to adhere to the fine and calibrated system of checks and balances which forms the bedrock of our governance structures . 
Any attempt by any organ of the State to overreach will unnecessarily lead to dissonance within the system . 
It is , therefore , necessary that all constitutional authorities introspect on their respective roles . 
I am aware of the initiatives of CAG to involve the civil society organizations and the beneficiaries in the audit process . 
This enriches the audit process and provides a feedback that is relevant and timely . 
You have well trained personnel and wide geographical reach . 
What we could all benefit from is a record of the best practices that you would come across in villages , blocks and districts in respect of social programmes so that these practices can be replicated . 
Audit reports are essentially feedback on the many programmes undertaken by the government . 
The tone and timeliness of such feedback is , therefore , important . 
The Central Government releases funds to State Governments and even to the local bodies at district levels . 
The utilization of these funds is known to the Central Government only through the mechanism of utilization certificates . 
By the time these utilization certificates are received , the programme has already been implemented . 
It is thus important that CAG ' s reports are presented in time so as to enable mid - course corrections , if required . 
We have a fairly stabilised system of the ' Public Accounts Committee ' and the ' Committee on Public Undertakings ' . 
Through these committees , the Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies exercise the oversight functions that are expected of them . 
These institutions have always functioned in a bipartisan manner and have contributed a great deal to the cause of transparency and good governance . 
It is an important responsibility of the legislators to ensure that such committees remain active and all important observations of audit are considered with all the seriousness that they deserve . 
I am happy to note that C & AG , as the Apex Audit Institution of India , has remained in the forefront of international audit . 
Apart from being a member of the Board of Auditors for UN and other Agencies for almost two decades , you have conducted audit of United Nations and many other International Organizations . 
You have earned great respect from the international community for your knowledge , skills and high professional calibre . 
I acknowledge that the unique institution of CAG has over the years , now more than 150 years old , made significant contribution to ensuring that we have governance systems that are transparent and accountable . 
I have great expectations from this Institution in our journey towards a prosperous and equitable future for our people . 
I would like to wish all members of the Indian Audit & Accounts Department all the best . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of the inauguration of Suvarna Soudha building
This beautiful structure stands on sacred soil , which was once ruled by the great queen Kittur Chennamma , who challenged the colonial powers . 
Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak launched the Home Rule League from Belgaum in 1916 with the words Freedom is my birthright . 
Mahatma Gandhiji presided over the historic Congress Session at Belgaum in 1924 , the only occasion the Mahatma chaired any session of the Indian National Congress . 
Encouraged by the Congress session , people from Belgaum took active part in the freedom movement . 
I understand Belgaum used to be known as Venu Grama ( Village of the flute ) . 
Today , this region is the Sugar bowl of the State . 
It has made immense contribution to Karnataka ' s history , education , literature , culture and economy . 
True to its name , Belgaum is known for music , especially Hindustani music . 
Many stalwarts like Kumar Gandharva , Mallikarjuna Mansur , Gangubai Hangal and Bhimsen Joshi come from this area and have added glory to Indian classical music . 
The Belgaum session of the Indian National Congress witnessed a Kannada song by Gangubhai Hangal . 
The 12th century thinker , social reformer , saint and religious teacher Basaveshwara lived in this part of the State and brought about sweeping social change in Karnataka and surrounding region . 
This Suvarna Soudha is inheritor of a proud and glorious tradition . 
Democratic process started in erstwhile Mysore state much before the rest of the country . 
Maharaja Chamaraj Wadiyar established the Mysore Representative Assembly way back in 1881 and his son Maharaja Krishnaraj Wadiyar established a Legislative Council in 1907 . 
Erstwhile Mysore was amongst the first princely states in India to start the formation of democratic institutions with a view to associating representatives of the people in the process of administration . 
This Representative Assembly saw several transformations and evolved into a mature house of legislation which is what we see today in the form of the bi - cameral house of Karnataka Legislative Assembly and Karnataka Legislative Council . 
I hope the northern districts of the State will now be much closer to governance and this will ensure balanced growth and development of the State by removing social , economical and educational imbalances . 
The Special Development Plan with the support of all political parties and the recommendations of the Dr . D . M . Nanjundappa High Level Committee on Redressal of Regional Imbalances which is being implemented across the state should help Karnataka achieve all round progress . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee to The Karnataka Legislature
It is an honour and a privilege to address this august body of the Karnataka legislature . 
The erstwhile rulers of Mysore heralded the dawn of Representative Assembly as early as 1881 . 
The Maharajas of Mysore were known for their benevolence and people oriented welfare measures . 
Gandhiji was impressed by the work of the Wodeyars and hailed the province as " Model Mysore " , worthy of emulation by other principalities . 
The present Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council carry on the tradition of the Representative Assembly . 
The Karnataka Legislature has set a tradition of high standards by introducing various progressive legislations . 
It is to the credit of this august body that legislations enacted here like the Land Reforms Act , Abolition of Manual Scavenging , Reservation in Education and Employment to the Backward Classes etc . , have been acclaimed and emulated by many States as well as the National Government . 
Elected Parliaments and legislature are the most critical ingredient of any true democracy . 
In our political system , Legislators are representatives of the people . 
They are entrusted with the responsibility for enacting legislations , discussing issues of governance and public interest , acting as a voice of the people and redressing their grievances through the legislative forum . 
The responsibility of ensuring that actions of the Government are in harmony with the wishes and interests of the people rests with elected representatives . 
It is through the effective discharge of their duties that the Rule of Law becomes a living reality of our society . 
Legislators must always remember that they act as Trustees of the public and that they need to be exemplary models of good conduct and responsible behaviour . 
Part VI Chapter 3 , Articles 168 to 177 of the Constitution of India deals with the general provisions governing the State Legislatures . 
While there is some uniformity in the composition and functioning of the State Legislatures , there does exist distinction between the bigger States and the smaller States . 
Since the beginning , some of the bigger States enjoyed bicameral legislatures consisting of both Legislative Assemblies and Legislative Councils but in course of time , some of the States opted for unicameral legislatures like West Bengal . 
In the case of Andhra Pradesh , it started with a bicameral legislature but in mid - eighties , it switched over to unicameral legislature and again recently they have reverted to bicameral legislature . 
Karnataka has bicameral legislature right from the beginning . In fact , even during the days of Maharajas , Karnataka had both Assembly and Council . 
Currently , Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh , Bihar , Karnataka Uttar Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir have bicameral legislatures . 
The primary responsibility of State Legislature is to enact laws required for good governance and administration of the State . 
The List - 2 of the Seventh Schedule consists of 66 items for State administration and legislation . 
Now - a - days , with heightened complexity of administration both in governance and legislations , the legislators must be careful in passing the legislations . 
It is a time consuming process both at the Committee stage and during discussions on the floor of the House . 
The trend being noticed now , which is not good for democracy , is that the time devoted by legislators towards legislation has gradually been declining . 
Legislators must always remember that as representatives of the people and custodians of public interests and rights , they have to be extremely careful in matters of legislation , money and finance . 
Elected representatives of the people , particularly in Legislative Assemblies , have exclusive control over money and finance . 
No expenditure can be incurred by the Executive without approval of Legislature , no tax can be levied except by a law passed by the Legislature and no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of the State without the approval of the Legislature . 
Legislature exercises this authority through Budget and other Money Bills . 
As per the Constitution , Money Bill can be certified only by the Speaker as per the provisions laid down in the Constitution ( Article 110 for Parliament , Article 198 and 199 ( 3 ) & ( 4 ) for the Assembly ) and can be introduced and passed only in the Legislative Assembly . 
Legislature , particularly the Legislative Assembly , is the master of the Executive in the sense that the Chief Minister along with his Council of Ministers is accountable collectively and severally to the Legislative Assembly . 
The Executive can be unseated at any time by passing a resolution of No Confidence in the State Legislative Assembly by a simple majority . 
Most of the instruments of governance are executed through appropriate laws passed by Legislatures . 
Therefore , Executive ' s dependence on Legislature is total . 
Legislatures must be responsible and responsive to this huge task entrusted on it by the Constitution to keep the wheels of our democratic functioning moving smoothly . 
To discharge this responsibility , Legislature must meet frequently . 
The work which can be done through Committees should be done at that stage and the core business of Legislature should be accomplished through regular sittings . 
Therefore , sittings of Legislature should be more frequent and they should meet at least for 20 to 25 weeks in a year . 
It is a sad commentary , going by the recent trends which we are noticing , that the legitimate functioning of the Legislative bodies is jeopardized by fewer number of days in session . 
Another disturbing trend noticed now - a - days is the frequent disruptions in the proceedings of the House . 
There may be occasions when normal business of the House is suspended to take up an urgent issue on which a large number of Members are agitated . 
But such occasions should be few and far between . 
In the rules of procedure of every Legislature , there are adequate provisions to raise issues of urgent public importance on the floor of the House in an orderly manner . 
Members can utilize those provisions to raise those issues in which they are interested but disruption of proceedings by frequent adjournments cannot be justified . 
Cardinal principle of effective functioning of Parliamentary system is majority will rule and minority will oppose , expose and if possible , depose . 
But this should be done within the framework of rules framed by Legislatures themselves . Disruption should never be allowed to be used as an effective Parliamentary intervention . 
Our Governance mechanisms must become citizen friendly , quick and accountable . 
I am happy to note that the " Sakala " programme implemented in accordance with the Guarantee of Citizens ' Services Act by the Karnataka Government has been a success . 
I am happy to note that Karnataka is the first State in the country to unveil a " Vision - 2020 " for comprehensive development . 
Such long term planning is critical to ensure that the state makes steady progress and is fully prepared to meet the challenges of the future . 
Karnataka also stands first in the country with 31 registrations out of 172 on All India basis in the category of Geographical Indications of Products ( GIP ) like Mysore Silk , Mysore Jasmine , Mysore Sandal Oil , Nanjangud Banana , Channapattana Toys , Bidriware , Ilkal and Molakalmur Sarees etc . 
Karnataka ' s strides in the area of e - Governance , empowerment of Panchayati Raj Institutions and Rural Development have been acclaimed nationally . 
It is a State where intellectual prowess co - exists with rich cultural heritage . 
Higher Institutions of Learning and Research like the Indian Institute of Science , ISRO , DRDO , HAL , CSIR Laboratories , Indian Institute of Information Technology and a number of Scientific , Health and Educational Institutions have over the years produced a vast pool of talented and skilled workforce . 
From the time of Sir M . Vishweshariah , Karnataka has a strong industrial base . 
It is today also known across the world as home to India ' s vibrant IT industry . 
People of Karnataka have proven themselves as excellent entrepreneurs and also attracted to the State the best of talent from across the country and the world . 
The State of Karnataka is heir to remarkable natural and human resources . 
It is therefore incumbent on the leadership of the State to ensure that its full potential is exploited . 
All stakeholders of the State must develop a consensus on a long term vision and back it up with suitable strategies so that the development dreams of its people can become a reality . 
A vibrant and prosperous Karnataka is a goal which can be achieved in the near term and it is the legislature more than any other institution which can ensure rapid progress towards this objective . 
There is nothing that stands in the way of development of this State if all join together and fulfill their duties and responsibilities towards the people and engage themselves in the cause of building a peaceful and prosperous Karnataka . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of conferring The Jnanapith Award for the year 2010 to Dr . Chandrashekhara kambar
I am very happy to be present here to confer the 46th Bharatiya Jnanpith Award on Dr . Chandrashekhara Kambar , the eighth awardee of this prestigious National Literary Award in Kannada language . 
I understand that Kannada has the highest number of awardees amongst regional languages and is next only to Hindi . 
This achievement should be a matter of pride and joy for all members of the Kannada literary fraternity and all Kannada speakers in India and across the world . 
Dr . Chandrashekhara Kambar joins the band of illustrious Kannada writers comprising Kuvempu , D . R . Bendre , K . Shivarama Karanth , Masti Venkatesha Iyengar , V . K . Gokak , U . R . Anantha Murthy and Girish Karnad who have received this award in the past . 
These writers and their works are a glowing testimony to the richness of Kannada literature . 
Dr . Chandrashekar Kambar is an icon not just in Karnataka but across India . 
A man of humble beginnings , I understand poverty forced him initially to drop - out at school level . 
However , he persevered in his efforts to gain formal education and went on to acquire postgraduate and doctorate degrees . 
He subsequently not only taught in the University of Chicago and Bangalore University but also became the Vice - Chancellor of the Kannada University at Hampi for two terms . 
I believe Dr . Kambar was able to develop the University into an important Centre of " Kannada Knowledge " conducting multi - disciplinary research into various aspects of Karnataka . 
Dr . Kambar has won many awards during his literary career and has been honoured by the nation with a Padmashri . 
He is well - known as a poet , playwright , short - story writer , novelist , folklorist and film - director . 
In his writings , he has retained the earthy flavour of rural Karnataka . 
Dr . Kambar has portrayed through his writings the subjects of conflict between tradition and modernity , identity , feudal decay and colonialism . 
He has presented in all his writings the perspective and world view of the down trodden . 
Dr . Kambar ' s multi - faceted genius can be seen in the fact that he has directed a number of movies based on his works , and also composed music for them . 
He has produced several documentaries for the State and Central governments . 
His elevation to the post of Chairman of the National School of Drama and the Karnataka Nataka Akademi speaks of his accomplishments in the field of theatre . 
I am delighted to know that a good number of his works have been translated into English and prominent Indian languages like Hindi , Marathi , Telugu , Tamil , Punjabi , Malayalam and Rajasthani . 
The Sahitya Akademi is doing commendable work to promote translations between Indian languages . 
But , that is not enough . State Governments , authors , translators , lovers of literature and the publishing industry should work together to ensure that the literature of our vernacular languages , both modern and classical , is available to readers in all corners of India . 
I am sure Dr . Kambar with his vast experience can guide efforts in this regard . 
The Jnanpith Award instituted in 1961 by Bharatiya Jnanpith , a trust founded by the Sahu Jain Family is along with the Sahitya Akademi Awards the foremost prize for Indian literature . 
Over the last half century , it has established itself as a prestigious award recognizing the best of literary talent in different languages of our country . 
I congratulate and compliment the Trustees for having sustained this outstanding initiative for over five decades and taken it from strength to strength . 
Literature cannot flourish based on the support of Government alone . 
Society at large , philanthropists and the private sector must play their role in nurturing and promoting the treasure of Indian languages and literature that is India ' s heritage . 
We need to do much more to recognize , nurture and promote excellence in writing in Indian languages . 
The creativity and talent that is widely present in Indian languages need better platforms and greater exposure . 
There is a need to take to the world Indian literature from our vernacular languages . 
Indian writing in English has sparked excitement and recognition across the world . 
Even greater laurels await us if we can expose the world to the flowering of creativity in our vernacular literature . 
I congratulate Dr . Chandrashekhara Kambar and wish him many more years of good health and achievements in his creativity and contributions for the benefit of the vast multitudes . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the convocation ceremony of King George ' s Medical University
I thank Shri B . L . Joshi , Governor of Uttar Pradesh and Chief Minister , Shri Akhilesh Yadav for a very warm welcome extended to me . 
I am no stranger to Uttar Pradesh . 
However this is my first visit to Uttar Pradesh after assumption of my present responsibility . 
On this occasion , my thoughts return to the glorious history of this region . 
I am humbled as I remember , with reverence , the great men and women who have walked this land . 
This is the land which inspired authors like Valmiki , Vyasa , Tulsidas , Surdas and Bhrigu who lived and composed their thought here . 
To come back to our own times , giants among our nation ' s freedom fighters and the leaders of its independence movement hailed from this land . 
It is a moment to remember that it was here that the first slogans for ' swaraj ' rang out , the first draft Constitution was passed and first steps towards self governance were taken . 
In Naini nearby , freedom fighters , including Motilal Nehru , Pt . Jawaharlal Nehru , Govind Ballabh Pant and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai and many others were imprisoned during the Indian independence movement . 
This is also the birthplace of Susruta , the ' Father of Surgery ' , whose seminal contributions have enriched the ancient science of Ayurveda . 
He lived , taught and practiced on the banks of the Ganges in the area that corresponds to the present day Varanasi . 
I consider it a privilege to be a part of the celebration of the 8th Convocation of this prestigious University . 
The King George ' s Medical University , which is now over 100 years old , has earned a name in the field of medical care , teaching and research , not only in India but internationally . 
I am always encouraged and rejuvenated when I interact with the youth of our country for it further strengthens my belief that the future of India is in safe hands . 
All of you today who are receiving your degrees and awards are some of the best and the brightest of our land . 
This Convocation marks the end of one phase of your life but , more importantly , the beginning of another wherein you will not only define yourselves in your quest for professional excellence but will also carry along the hopes , aspirations and dreams of resurgent India . 
India has made significant progress since Independence . Our achievements in Agriculture , Industry , Trade , Defence , Space and Atomic Energy have been exceptional . 
We are known the world over for our talented reservoir of scientists , doctors and IT professionals . 
With our fast growing economy and democratic institutions of State , which have withstood the test of time , we are well on our way to being a leading economic power
There are , however , many challenges that we need to confront and many battles that we need to fight before we can truly claim to have elevated the quality of life of our people . 
Provision of universal healthcare is one such challenge and , therefore , one of the top most priorities for Government . 
The Eleventh Plan had noted that though the total expenditure on health in India , as a percentage of GDP , was around 5 % , there was a disproportionately high reliance on private , particularly household ' s out of pocket expenditure on health . 
This reflected a critical imbalance in the health care system which stemmed from deficiencies in the public sector ' s capacity to deliver basic health care . 
The National Rural Health Mission ( NRHM ) launched in 2005 aimed at strengthening healthcare infrastructure in rural areas . 
As per data available , Public Health expenditure is likely to have reached 1 . 4 % of GDP by the end of the Eleventh Plan period . 
We now aim at raising the public health expenditure to 2 . 5 % of GDP by the end of the Twelfth Plan period . 
Lack of human resources is as responsible for inadequate provision of health services as lack of physical infrastructure , especially in rural areas . 
The density of doctors in India is only 0 . 6 per 1 , 000 and that of nurses and midwives 1 . 30 per 1000 , representing collectively 1 . 9 health workers per 1 , 000 pointing clearly to the acute shortage of healthcare professionals . 
In addition , because of a skewed distribution of cadres of health workers , the vulnerable populations in rural , tribal and hilly areas continue to be under - served . 
We must , therefore , ensure a sizeable expansion in teaching institutions for doctors , nurses and paramedics . 
he on - going initiatives for integrating AYUSH and capacity development of the traditional healthcare providers need strengthening . 
Positive traditional healthcare practices and local remedies need to be encouraged . 
The Central Government is also providing financial assistance to State Governments for strengthening and up - gradation of Government medical colleges to enable them to create new Post Graduate seats and start new Post Graduate Departments . 
Distance learning should be encouraged and popularised - as also extension services in rural areas . 
Non - Government Organizations and private sector entrepreneurs should also step up their involvement in an effort to share responsibility and make a contribution . 
We also need to devise effective and sustainable solutions to the existing and emerging health problems faced by our vast population . 
This would need innovations in preventive approaches , treatments and rehabilitation . 
The frontiers of science and technologies must be extended for improving the health of the people , especially the poor . 
People must be at heart of advances in health and delivery of healthcare . 
The new challenges of the country ' s health sectors are opportunities for the Institute to further contribute towards nation building . 
Excellence of this institution should not be confined to Lucknow only but must touch the hearts of the millions all over the State who are still struggling for equitable access to quality health care . 
Gandhiji , who taught by his own example , observed , " Service that is rendered without joy helps neither the servant nor the served . 
But all other pleasures as possessions pale into nothingness before service which is rendered in a spirit of joy . " 
I would like to leave these thoughts with you as I extend my best wishes to the graduating students and awardees in their future endeavours . 
I would also like to congratulate Prof . Prem Puri and Surendra K . Varma for receiving the D . Sc . Honoris Causa from this prestigious University for the unique contribution in the profession and for serving humanity . 
I am sure you all will strive to be good human beings , for only then can you be good doctors , and weave a web of life full of joy , peace and purpose . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of The Petrotech 2012 conference
It gives me great pleasure to be with you today for the inauguration of Petrotech - 2012 . 
I congratulate the Petrotech Society for their contribution to the development of the hydrocarbon sector in India and its integration with the global hydrocarbon industry . 
. I also welcome the recognition being accorded today to five eminent persons in this sector - in the form of Lifetime Achievement Awards - for their leadership and significant contribution to the Oil and Natural Gas Sector in India . 
Petrotech 2012 will , I understand , cover the technical , economical , environmental and safety aspects of the petroleum industry and showcase the achievements of India ' s hydrocarbon sector . 
I recall that the first Petrotech Conference was organized in 1995 at a time when the Indian economy was going through a major transformation . 
Today , again , India ' s energy sector is at a critical juncture . 
As a developing country , with a population of over 1 . 2 billion and a growing economy , our high dependence on imported oil has taken our crude import bill beyond the $ 150 billion mark . 
Our import dependence has been rising and is currently about 75 percent . 
There is , on one hand , a growing demand for energy and at the same time a set of challenging resource constraints which call for a reshape of the matrix of our energy policy . 
This will definitely happen gradually and eventually - over the coming decades , but it poses urgent questions today . 
Our nation ' s response and the time that we will need to develop new technologies and reset the overall energy matrix will have to be carefully calibrated . 
This calls for coordinated action , efficient planning and massive investment . 
Discoveries of new oil and gas reserves in the recent past in India have been encouraging . 
Government of India ' s New Exploration Licensing Policy launched in 1997 - 98 has seen investment of over USD 14 billion and has resulted in 87 oil & gas discoveries . 
NELP has all the ingredients of a favourable investment climate , fiscal stability , transparency of the rule of law , contract stability , minimal policy induced uncertainties and a stable legal and regulatory framework . 
The Indian Oil and Gas industry , in the last decade , has seen a robust growth in domestic production . 
The refining sector in India , too , has witnessed a silent revolution . 
India has , over the years , developed into a major export hub . 
With a refining capacity of 215 million metric tonnes per annum , exports of petroleum products have now crossed 60 million tonnes , fetching revenue of close to USD 60 billion . 
It has emerged as the single largest component of merchandise exports from India . 
India ' s oil industry has been able to meet targets for introduction of improved quality fuels . 
This has had a salutary effect on the ambient air quality in our cities . 
Another significant step by the oil industry towards reducing pollution and improving the environment is substitution of petroleum products with Natural Gas . 
As of 31st March 2012 , 776 CNG stations are providing CNG to approximately 1 . 7 million vehicles in 10 States of India . 
Virtually the entire public transport in Delhi is currently running on CNG . Further , Oil Companies are supplying natural gas to approximately 1 . 9 million households . 
In the present climate of rapid changes in the hydrocarbons sector , our Government ' s top priority is to realize the full potential of coal bed methane , shale gas , underground coal gas , gas hydrates , and biofuels . 
The Government is working towards extending fiscal incentives similar to those provided for exploration of oil to all forms of natural gas exploration and exploitation . 
Government of India is also currently extending full support to companies acquiring overseas oil and gas assets and imports of LNG . 
It would , in this context , be necessary to accord due priority to the development of a countrywide gas pipeline transportation infrastructure . 
For a GDP growth of over 8 % during India ' s XII plan , it would be imperative for us to ensure better demand management in our country . 
In the present international environment of rising petroleum prices , greater alignment of prices to global prices is in the interest of both consumers as well as investors . 
Government of India is committed to adopt a time - bound programme to achieve this . 
I expect the industry to play a helpful role in achieving the Government ' s objectives . 
There must be increased understanding of the fact that the path to a more sustainable future will require our society to make a better balance between its energy consumption vis a vis its cost and availability . 
Just like financial markets , the world energy markets are inherently global and interdependent , and no single country can isolate itself from the market . Interdependence is central to energy security . 
The emergence of major consumers in Asia , mainly India and China , has fundamentally changed the global energy equations . 
The " global nature " of these challenges and the growing symbiotic connect between producing , consuming and transiting countries , requires a strengthened partnership between all state actors to enhance global energy security . 
Apart from pricing and sourcing , research and development of new technologies is another area that requires special attention . 
The traditional oil ' Majors ' can no longer feel complacent about extensive reserves , refineries , and distribution networks being their mainstay . 
As a matter of fact , today ' s winners are companies who have a grip on emerging new technologies . 
Many industry solutions are being provided by jointly funded research in Universities . 
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and the Department of Science and Technology , Government of India actively support Research and Development projects undertaken by academic institutions as well as industry players . 
We need to build strong economic partnerships with other producing countries and their oil and gas industries to the mutual benefit of each other . 
We should seek to work together with other countries , especially those who are active in the oil and gas sector . 
I would suggest to the participants of Petrotech 2012 to explore the possibility of an association of oil and gas companies to deliberate upon such issues of shared interest . 
I am confident that PETROTECH 2012 will focus on such issues . 
The challenges confronting this sector are many but I am confident that our oil sector has , over the years , acquired the maturity and vision to surmount these challenges . 
I call upon you to pursue the application of advanced and innovative but affordable technologies - adapted to our specific conditions . 
A healthy and viable hydrocarbons sector can help alter our growth trajectory . 
Conferences like the Petrotech enable our professionals , both managers and technologists , to keep abreast of the latest developments at global level . 
The Indian hydrocarbon sector must be equipped to responsibly deliver ever cleaner , ever more reliable and ever more affordable energy . 
I expect the domestic Oil & Gas industry to place sustainable development at the core of its business decisions . 
This means placing safety , environment , and community interest at the centre of its policies . 
I hope that the deliberations of your conference contribute to the building of a vibrant energy sector in India , which can be the bedrock of growth and prosperity . 
I wish this conference all success ! 
With these words , I declare PETROTECH - 2012 open . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the 40th convocation of The All India Institute of Medical Sciences
I am very happy to be present at the 40th convocation of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences . 
This Institute is a tribute to the vision of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Raj Kumari Amrit Kaur who foresaw the need for an institution that can emerge as the trail blazer for medical education and research in the country . 
AIIMS is also a living tribute to the faculty , staff and students who have , over the years , worked selflessly to bring the Institute to its present position of pre - eminence . 
It is due to their efforts that this Institute stands out as a beacon of hope and succour for the thousands who throng its corridors seeking relief from their maladies and sufferings . 
I am honoured to have been invited to address the Convocation of an Institute with such glowing credentials . 
Let me begin by congratulating the students and scholars who are receiving their degrees and prizes today . 
The Convocation marks the fruition of your hard work and your transition from students to professionals , from scholars to scientists . 
You now don the mantle of disseminators of the knowledge and skills acquired at the institute from your teachers and mentors . 
While you must rejoice and celebrate your achievements , you must also realize the enormity of responsibility that has been placed upon you . 
The baton of knowledge and skills , that you have received and the values you have imbibed must be carried with the same spirit and zeal as has been done by your teachers . 
This has to be a lifelong commitment and this is the only ' gurudakshina ' your teachers , mentors and your Alma Mater would perhaps expect from you . 
No other Institute is so intensely watched by government , the Parliament , the media and by the public at large as AIIMS as they all see AIIMS as a symbol of excellence in medical sciences . 
The country expects the Institute , its faculty and students to live up to this illustrious image . 
AIIMS must rise to be one of the 10 best medical universities in the world by the year 2020 . 
The target is ambitious but not insurmountable . 
I charge you - the faculty , the scientists , the scholars , the students and the staff , to focus on this singular goal . 
Knowledge is the driver of today ' s world . 
While we stand today at the cusp of greatness in several fields on the global platform , our energy and innovation thrust in the field of medical sciences is yet to scale the heights . 
We look upon AIIMS to lead India to the frontiers of innovative solutions in health care , discovering new cures , harnessing existing and emerging technologies for affordable healthcare , and exploring new paradigms for preventing disease and creating wellness . 
AIIMS should be a power house of biomedical research and a role model for others . 
This role is germane to the Institute ' s identity as a biomedical sciences university - and this places you in an altogether different league . 
It is good that AIIMS is setting up its second campus at Jhajjar in Haryana . 
We should develop world class centres of excellence focused not only on traditional specialties but also on cross - cutting themes such as infectious diseases , vaccine development and regenerative sciences . 
You must step forward and become leaders in the world of medicine . 
The government will support you in this endeavour in every possible way but the faculty and scientists of AIIMS must show that it can push frontiers of biomedical research and innovation to the highest orbit . 
Health is among the topmost priorities of the Government . 
Progress in the health sector is key to India ' s future place of prominence in the world . 
Nation ' s productivity depends on the health and well - being of its citizens . 
Economic growth that does not go hand in hand with reduction in avoidable mortality and ill health is neither sustainable nor desirable . 
I am deeply concerned about the impoverishing impact of health and medical expenses on the vulnerable sections of our society . 
It is unacceptable that almost 80 % of the expenditure on healthcare by our people is met by personal , out of pocket , payment . 
I am shocked to note that as many as 4 crore people of our country plunge into poverty each year due to expenses on medical treatment . 
Yet , we should remember that the health services for the poor cannot be poor health services . 
We need to craft a high quality national health system that is used by the poor and the rich alike . 
Time has come for India to aim at attaining Universal Health Coverage in the next 2 to 3 Plan periods . 
It is possible today to leverage reasonable amount of resources to make bold and sustained investment in health . 
I visualize public spending on health rising to 2 . 5 % of the GDP by the end of the Twelfth Plan period . 
Provision of universal health care is a matter of faith for the Government . 
For this , the public health system must be greatly expanded and strengthened across the Nation . 
We need many more nurses , doctors , paramedics and health workers . 
We need to decentralize planning and implementation of healthcare to the district and sub - district levels . 
We need to take health services closer to the homes of the families - even a primary health centre is too far by today ' s standard and need . 
We need out of the box managerial and administrative reforms in the health departments at the state and central level . 
We need public health professionals to spearhead public health programs . 
We need to develop effective models of healthcare for the ever - increasing urban population . 
The foundation of India ' s national health system must be a strong , sensitive and efficient public health system . 
I call upon all stakeholders to join hands to build a solid consensus for a historic transformation of India ' s health sector in the coming years . 
People must be at heart of advances in health and delivery of healthcare . 
The uniqueness of AIIMS stems from its being people - centric in its functioning . 
The Institute ' s contribution to national programmes including the Integrated Child Development Services , Iodine Deficiency Disease Control program , Reproductive and Child Health , diarrheal disease , health of the elderly , AIDS control and the non communicable diseases is noteworthy . 
However , the new challenges of the country ' s health sectors are opportunities for the Institute not only in its zeal for excellence but to contribute towards nation building . 
Excellence should not be confined to Delhi but must touch the hearts of the millions all over the country who are still struggling for equitable access to quality health care . 
I urge the Health Ministry , the Indian Council of Medical Research and the Institute to work in unison . 
Research synergized with field experience should seamlessly flow into the national health programmes . 
Research must not only be acclaimed by the academia , but must benefit the public at large . 
I wish all the graduating students and awardees the very best in their future endeavours . 
I urge them to live this dream for the nation by dedicating themselves to the service of mankind . 
You , as we all do , owe it to our great country . 
Banquet speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee in honour of His Majesty Juan Carlos I , King of Spain
It gives me great pleasure to extend a very warm welcome to His Majesty , King Juan Carlos on his second State Visit to India . 
Your Majesty , King Juan Carlos , you are a long standing friend of India . 
Under your stewardship , your Government has remained committed to building a strong and enduring relationship with India . 
We have , together , taken steady steps to build and expand our linkages and bonds of trade , tourism and investments . 
These have been based on a strong foundation of well established people to people contacts developed over the centuries . 
Had Captain Christopher Columbus discovered the route to India instead of America , perhaps the history of our relationship may , too , have taken quite a different course . 
Your Majesty ' s presence here today is an important milestone . 
Your visit is taking place 30 years after your last State Visit to India - in January 1982 , when you were Chief Guest at our Republic Day celebrations . 
Much has changed since - not only in both our countries but in all parts of the world . 
The international scenario has transformed itself through the dramatic political developments that have taken place ; our world has shrunk significantly through the IT and telecommunications revolution and globalization has permanently altered the way we do things . 
Having presided over a remarkable transition to parliamentary monarchy in Spain , you have remained the symbol of the unity and permanence of the Spanish State . 
You have safeguarded the institution of the Parliament and preserved democracy in your country . 
You have strongly repudiated attempts to unsettle the democratic processes and institutions outlined by your Constitution and ratified by the Spanish people . 
Under your leadership , Spain has come to be recognized as an outstanding example of a democracy organized in the form of a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy . 
India and Spain , as democratic and open societies , have a number of synergies . 
We have successfully taken advantage of these to our mutual benefit . 
Our peoples have been fortunate partners and our Governments have a shared interest in the success of their initiatives and joint ventures in every sector . 
We both recognize the need to preserve the gains of globalization and to work bilaterally and multilaterally to shape a new global agenda for inclusive and sustained growth . 
We would like to create a path for future development that goes beyond recovery from the current crisis . 
Although it is natural for some Governments to resort to protectionist measures for short term gains , they are increasingly acknowledging that in the longer term , it is counter productive to erect barriers to movement of people , services , and capital . 
Many international financial institutions are currently facing a resource crunch . 
This is , therefore , the time for effective solutions and even reform of those institutions . 
Democratic societies such as ours have the inherent ability to convert challenges into opportunities during difficult times . 
Spain ' s commitment to the Euro - project has sent out a strong and positive signal - as also the fact that you are taking all the necessary steps to overcome the debt crisis . 
In India , similarly , a number of reforms - that have been introduced recently , bear testimony to our own determination to overcome the global economic slowdown . 
We are committed to providing an enabling environment for business and industry to invest in India . 
Spain has developed cutting edge technologies and possesses expertise in diverse areas such as infrastructure , renewable energy , agriculture , water treatment , and solid waste management . 
These are areas of priority interest for India . 
We , too , have much to offer Spain in information technology , pharmaceuticals , agricultural products and other key areas of your interest - where high quality and reasonable costs make business with India all the more attractive . 
There is tremendous potential for further co - operation between Spain and India . 
We welcome Spain ' s interest in India . 
We welcome your observation that Spain ' s global vocation will lead you to continue to extend and consolidate relations with " dynamic and thriving " economies such as ours . 
Our Government reciprocates the sentiment . 
We would stress that it would be in our interest to facilitate travel - of businessmen , tourists , students and professionals - between India and Spain . Connectivity - by way of direct air links - and interactions between our peoples will further boost the level of the engagement between our various sectors . 
Terrorism has emerged as one of the biggest threats to international peace and security . 
Sadly our two countries have , repeatedly , been victims of some of its most deadly manifestations . 
To defeat this menace , the global community must take concerted action against terrorists and their sponsors . 
If there is one man in history whose name is synonymous with peace , then it is Mahatma Gandhi , who we call " Father of our Nation " . 
Though he never had occasion to visit Spain , I am told that his ideals and philosophy have found a permanent place in the hearts of communities across Spain . 
The 150th birth anniversary of another great Indian , Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore , was celebrated last year in commemorative events across the continents . 
We were happy to learn that a priceless collection of Tagore memorabilia owned by a collector in Galicia , Dr . Jose Paz has been donated to the Casa de la India where it will be preserved and displayed . 
Your Majesty , we welcome the interest taken by the people of Spain in India ' s rich culture and heritage . 
We appreciate the contribution of Casa Asia in organising activities for cultural and educational exchanges between our societies . 
I would like to recognize the role played by Casa de la India , a cultural foundation supported by both our Governments , as a platform for dialogue and mutual understanding between our peoples . 
In New Delhi , the Cervantes Institute promotes Spanish culture ; Indian films shot in Spain have brought the vibrancy of Spain to Indian audiences and I am told that the " Tomatina " festival has caught the imagination of many young Indians ! 
They are avidly following Spain ' s impressive achievements in the field of football and share your pride at achieving the position of reigning World and European football champions . 
I am confident that the strong affinities and substantial potential will take the abiding friendship between our peoples to a new level . 
The agreements that have been signed today will set the agenda for our work ahead . 
I do look forward to a mutually beneficial and productive partnership between our two Governments - that will further our growth and bring more progress and prosperity to our peoples . 
I am confident that your visit will give an impetus to the efforts of our respective Ministries to engage , take new initiatives and enhance bilateral co - operation . 
With these few words , I once again welcome you , Your Majesty and your distinguished delegation . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , I now invite you to please join me in raising a toast : 
- to the good health and personal well - being of His Majesty , King Juan Carlos , King of Spain ; 
- to the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of Spain ; and
- to lasting friendship between India and Spain . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at a function organized to pay homage to cartoonist Late Shri P . K . S . Kutty
Shri Kutty arrived in Delhi in 1941 as an understudy to the legendary Shankar . 
For around 57 years , he commented day after day on the national scene , chronicling the modern history of India through some of its momentous phases . 
Kutty spent much of his career in Delhi . 
As a veteran cartoonist with a Central Hall pass , he was a regular presence in Parliament House . 
I am told way back in the 1960s , the late Kamaraj ji asked Kutty in a lighter vein who his choice for Prime Minister was . 
Kutty replied , " Give me a PM who is easy to draw’’ . 
Of course Kutty went on to draw every PM with equal ease - from Panditji to Manmohan Singhji . 
I have been a recurring target of Kutty ' s cartoons in my long years in public life , particularly because he drew for Bengali newspapers like Ananda Bazar Patrika and Aaj Kal . 
It is the job of a cartoonist to convey important social messages by using humour as a tool . 
Laughter is a stress buster for the public as well as the politician . 
The cartoon reminds the public that the ruler is as fallible and human as they are . 
The cartoon came to us as part of British legacy . 
It however found a receptive Indian mind awaiting it . 
Humour magazines blossomed in many parts of the country modeled on the London Punch . 
By one estimate as many as 70 Punch - like magazines and newspapers had appeared in at least a dozen Indian towns by the end of 19th Century . 
We had the Urdu Punch , Awadh Punch and Parsee Punch . 
I am sure it would be of interest to this gathering that we have discovered in our Rashtrapati Bhavan Library a rare collection of Punch magazines published from 1843 to 1927 . 
We are in the process of restoring these magazines and would be happy to open them out for viewing by cartoonists and scholars of modern history as soon as they are ready . 
Till about the late 1980s , a leader was recognised more by her caricature than the photograph
So much so that the older leaders collected and displayed their caricatures in their workplace . 
They could live with their own funny pictures , and because they found in the popular cartoon a ready connect to the public . 
I myself had cartoons of me drawn by Laxman on my walls till recently . 
A cartoonist like Kutty put across his comment sharply but with refreshing humour and he as well as his guru , Shankar , passed on this culture to succeeding generations of cartoonists . 
To be able to lampoon without hurting , caricature without distorting , to say with a few strokes of the brush what lengthy editorials fail to express - this is the art of the cartoonist . 
Cartoonists hold up the mirror to our public life and help us as a nation to see ourselves . 
We , as a country , must return to the Nehruvian times ; cultivate a temper which welcomes criticism , where comment is free but facts are held sacred . 
Indira ji has written in her foreword to a collection of Shankar ' s cartoons on Nehru : 
Cartoons have become an integral part of the intellectual life of a modern society . 
Some draw without intent to draw blood ; some remove masks and hold a mirror to the face of the society . 
There cannot be a cartoon without a certain amount of irreverence . 
I conclude by paying tribute to the contribution made by Shri Kutty to the modern cultural and political history of our country . 
As a person from Kerala , who lived in Delhi and drew cartoons for Bengali newspapers ( even though he spoke no Bengali ) , Shri Kutty was a quintessential Indian . 
His life and works were not limited by linguistic or State boundaries . 
I call upon the cartoonist fraternity of India to keep his memory alive by excelling in their chosen craft
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of Viswa Malayalee Mahotsav
It is indeed a pleasure to be here in Kerala , God ' s Own Country for the Viswa Malayala Mahotsavam , the grand festival of Malayalam . 
This is my first visit to Kerala after assuming the office of President . 
I am extremely happy that this occasion affords me the opportunity to meet a cross section of the vibrant literary and academic communities present here today . 
It is also significant that this Festival is being held on the 56th anniversary of the birth of Kerala , on the basis of linguistic re - organisation on November 1 , 1956 . 
I extend my warm greetings to you all - and through you , to the people of Kerala . 
You will deliberate , over the next three days , on the significance , current evolution and development as well as the future of Malayalam . 
You will address shared concerns , and you will take initiatives based on your collective sense of what needs to be done . 
The canvas of Indian culture is a vast and unique kaleidoscope . It is enriched by the heritage and cultural traditions of its constituent societies . 
India ' s ' unity in diversity ' has always provided the space that is required for their sustenance and growth . 
Within this happy co - existence , Malayalam is the essence and embodiment of the rich history , culture , art and heritage of the Malayali people . 
The Viswa Malayala Mahotsavam - 2012 that is being inaugurated today , celebrates the language and unique cultural identity that is Malayalam . 
On this occasion , we are also acknowledging Kerala ' s unique and ancient history . 
It has been a melting pot of cultures and races and linguistic and religious influences . 
The Sumerians , one of the earliest urban societies to emerge in the world in Southern Mesopotamia more than 5000 years ago , knew Kerala as a major spice trading centre . 
The Aitareya Aranyaka which belongs to the Aitareya Shakha of the Rig Veda composed in the period between 1700 - 1100 BC is the earliest Sanskrit work that specifically mentions Kerala . 
With regard to the language , Malayalam , carvings in the Edakkal Caves in Wayanad provide evidence that the common people of Kerala were expressing themselves in Malayalam at about the end of the 4th century AD . 
The earliest known record in Malayalam is an inscription dated to approximately 830 AD . 
The script , as Koleluttu or " Rod Script " , is derived from the Grantha script , which in turn is derived from Brahmi . 
Experts generally agree that Malayalam evolved either from a dialect of Tamil or from the branch of the Proto - Dravidian language - from which modern Tamil also evolved . 
They agree that Sanskrit words had influenced Malayalam . 
It is recorded that although Tamil continued to be used as the literary idiom for some time , eventually , the people ' s language prevailed in this region and Malayalam became the language of communication for all purposes by the beginning of the early 9th century AD . 
But Malayalam ' s links to Tamil and Sanskrit have endowed it with a number of unique characteristics still evident in the modern language . 
Today , an estimated 35 million Malayalam speakers can be found around the world , the majority of them concentrated in India . 
The earliest literary work in the Malayalam language is said to be the " Ramacharitam " ( which translates literally to " Deeds of Rama " ) , an epic poem dating to the 12th or 13th century . 
In later centuries , a more comprehensive body of Malayalam literary work began to emerge . 
Some well - known Malayalam language writers include the classical poets Thunchath Ezhuthachan and Kunjan Nambiar as well as Kumaran Asan of modern period and the novelists C . V . Raman Pillai , Chandu Menon , Vaikom Muhammad Basheer and Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai . 
The latter ' s works brilliantly portrayed Kerala society and events . At the same time , there was an equal interest in literary works of other languages . 
The epic , ' Vyasa Mahabharatham ' was first translated into Malayalam . Not to forget , every major Bengali work of literature has been translated into Malayalam . 
Malayalam being one of the most evolved languages of our country , it is but natural that many of the greatest literateurs of our times are Malayalis . 
Starting with G . Sankara Kurup , the recipient of the first ' Jnanpith Award ' , contemporary Malayalam writers have set high standards . 
I am delighted to know we have with us today two ' Jnanpith Award ' winners , Shri M . T . Vasudevan Nair and Shri O . N . V . Kurup . 
A language , however much it may be enriched with traditional values and heritage , would loose its relevance and popularity if it did not evolve . 
It is therefore necessary , while safeguarding our cherished languages , to promote them through all the modern means at our disposal today - while at the same time , taking care to nurture their uniqueness . 
A language that is ill equipped to meet the requirements of the new generation , cannot be safe in its hands . 
This Mahostavam will , no doubt , address such issues . 
I understand a new Malayalam University will start functioning from November 1 , 2012 at Tirur and will be dedicated to the study of Malayalam linguistics , literature , performing arts , visual arts and architecture , cultural anthropology and cultural and intellectual heritage studies among others . 
I have no doubt that the research and activities in this University will positively impact the preservation and propagation of Malayalam . 
I see the Viswa Malayala Mahostavam as a very timely initiative in this context . 
Kerala is rightly referred to as a land blessed with the bounties of nature and a people who have proven themselves to be at the forefront of social and educational reforms . 
This is the first state in the country to attain cent percent literacy . 
With the development of Malayalam , a ' Keralite ' identity has evolved while simultaneously remaining open , tolerant and hospitable to new elements and influences . 
For Malayalis within the state - and more than 30 lakh who are spread across the world , I am sure that this sammelan will provide a platform to share experiences , hopes and aspirations . 
You will , no doubt , use this occasion to set the agenda and the goals to be achieved through this platform . 
I once again wish you all a very purposeful sammelan and look forward to hearing of its successful outcome . 
With these words , I inaugurate the Viswa Malayala Mahotsavam - 2012 . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of flagging off The 9th Jan Vigyan Yatra Organized by P . N . Panicker Vigyan Vikas Kendra
It gives me great pleasure to join you today to flag off the 9th P . N . Panicker Vigyan Vikas Yatra . 
I was very much interested when I heard about this annual event organized by the P . N . Panicker Vigyan Vikas Kendra in collaboration with the Government of Kerala and other agencies . 
I understand that the Yatra is one of the flagship events of the Kendra - whose mission it is to spread education to reduce poverty . 
I understood this to be a remarkably effective method of outreach which has proven to be successful and result oriented . 
It has become widely known as a focused grass - root level campaign to encourage reading and love for books among the young . 
I was struck by its simplicity - and its evolution from a small reading room in a village into a movement for mass literacy - which shows that it has been embraced by the people for whom it is meant . 
They have not only responded , but taken full advantage of it . 
It is hardly any surprise that this programme of mass contact has successfully instilled in the young people in Kerala , a thirst for learning and a scientific temper by taking knowledge and the instruments of learning to those who have no access to them . 
Today , the Government of India ' s national literacy mission draws inspiration from the work and methods of Shri P . N Panicker . 
This is also an opportunity to pay tribute to the Shri P . N . Panicker , father of the Library Movement , who dedicated his life to initiate and guide this highly successful literacy movement . 
From the Travancore Library Association that he founded in 1945 with 47 rural libraries , he developed a series of similar units which has now grown into a network of 6000 libraries and a tremendously successful movement for total literacy in Kerala . 
Shri P . N . Panicker had a simple but powerful slogan , ' vayichu valaruka ' which exulted all children to read and grow . 
Shri P . N . Panicker , like many of us , was driven by Gandhiji ' s words - that " Mass illiteracy is India ' s sin and shame and must be liquidated " . 
In keeping with his commitment to Gandhian ideals , he also built into his programme a campaign to foster social amity and harmony . 
I am indeed satisfied to note that the Yatra aims at discussions on participatory democracy , panchayat - centred development and awareness about the importance and significance of grama sabhas . 
I note that the yatra will cover a distance of 2000 kms . in 30 days and will cover a population of about 30 lakh citizens . 
In undertaking this Yatra , the young participants will propagate the message of P . N . Panicker and spread awareness of his invaluable service to this State . 
I am also happy to note that the yatra has very specific plans - of creating micro units of excellence , innovation through entrepreneurship , better productivity and competitiveness . 
The yatra has rightly chosen a target group of farmers , unorganized labourers , Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other under - privileged communities . 
I understand that the participants will interact with the populations that they will cover - through a direct method of presenting concepts through street theatre . 
I commend them for choosing to focus on developing an interest in the youth - the leaders of tomorrow - and motivating them to think about their own individual contribution to the growth and progress of their societies . 
I would like to congratulate the Government of Kerala for their observance of 19th June , the date of the passing of this great visionary , Shri P . N . Panicker , as the " Day of Reading " which is annually marked by a week of public events and activities in schools and educational institutions . 
There could be no better way to honour the monumental contribution of Shri P . N . Panicker to literacy and education in this , " God ' s own Country " . 
With these few words , I extend my best wishes to the participants in the P . N . Panicker Vigyan Vikas Yatra and wish them every success in their project . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of The Golden Jubilee Celebrations of The Loyola College of Social Sciences
I am very happy to be here today to inaugurate the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of this prestigious Institution . 
The Loyola College of Social Sciences , a ' pioneer ' in social service has been training generation after generation of men and women , motivating them to go forth , deliver services and work for social change . 
Once Swami Vivekananda has said " From time immemorial India has been a mine of precious ideas to human society ; giving birth to high ideas herself , she has freely distributed them and broadcast over the whole world . " 
In pursuing your mission with dedication and commitment , students of Loyola College are making a significant difference in realizing Swami Vivekananda ' s vision for our people . 
I am aware of the long and distinguished history of the Loyola College since it was conceived and established by Rev . Joseph Edamaram , the first Provincial of the Kerala Jesuit Province . 
He had dreamt of an institute of Social Sciences that would contribute to the building of a diverse and well knit , resurgent society - particularly in the state of Kerala . 
He wanted to propagate the motto of the Jesuit Society - to imbue in students the elements that would help them to transcend the goals of money , faith and success and create leaders devoted to the betterment of society and the world . 
I am happy to learn that Loyola College , Trivandrum has lived up to this vision , blending education and praxis , learning and intervention . 
The college has steadfastly pursued the triple goals of teaching , research and extension . 
I am also happy to see that as a pioneer teaching institute the Loyola College has trained thousands of social workers , social scientists and personnel managers - who have themselves carried forward and extended this training through projects and initiatives in collaboration with associates in India and abroad . 
I would , nevertheless , take this opportunity to remind the young trainees and students of the Loyola College to pause and consider some of the challenges that still needs to be addressed . 
For example , despite its high literacy rate of 86 percent , Kerala has a relatively low profile of women in public life . 
Statistics show a concentration of women in the unorganized sectors including agricultural labour , cottage and traditional industries and selected service sectors where equal pay for equal work is unfortunately not well established . 
A perceptible marginalization of women in the economic process and their low level of control over resources have been major impediments in improving their status in Kerala . 
This is despite the generally progressive political environment in Kerala . 
There needs to be more active involvement of women in various leadership levels in the State . 
A good step in this direction is the reservation of 50 % of seats in local bodies and Panchayats for the women . 
As an institution of Social Sciences ranking 6th among the best colleges in this field , it is incumbent upon the graduating classes today to be all the more conscious of their social responsibility . 
As enlightened alumni of the Loyola College , you have a head start - and can do more for the building of a socialist , secular democratic society not only in Kerala but all over India . 
I call upon you to commit yourselves to more outreach , new projects and a wider range of activities at multiple levels in society . 
With these words , I have the pleasure to declare the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of Loyola College of Social Sciences , Thiruvananthapuram open . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee for receiving The National Innovation Council ' s ' Report To The People ' 2012
I am delighted to receive the Second annual ' Report to the People ' of the National Innovation Council . 
The Council , with eminent personalities from diverse walks of life , was constituted to realise the vision of the Government of shaping the next decade as India ' s ' Decade of Innovation ' . 
In an era marked by rapid technological advancements , ' Innovation ' is the key driver of growth and development . 
An innovative approach becomes even more imperative in our context , where there is a huge reservoir of unmet needs in areas such as health , education , water , food security and energy . 
Innovation can provide solutions to such challenges and , in the process , also enable many more people to harness the gains from India ' s growth story . 
India has tremendous untapped potential for innovation . 
Not only does our demographic dividend and thriving democracy provide fertile ground for innovation , but our population of 550 million persons aged below 25 makes it imperative that we innovate to meet their needs in a sustainable manner , while also creating new opportunities for them . 
As brought out by the National Innovation Council in its ' Report to the People ' , we have to evolve our own model of development - which must be based on our unique needs and challenges , especially the challenge of equitable growth . 
The prime focus has to be on affordability , sustainability and scalability . 
India today needs to innovate products and services that are affordable and which do not compromise on either efficiency or quality . 
This model of innovation must pervade our working environment if we are to truly empower people of our nation . 
It can also serve as a model of sustainable development for the rest of the world . 
I am happy to note that the National Innovation Council has undertaken several initiatives to set the country firmly on the path to innovation , with a special focus on inclusive growth . 
The Council has been working towards creating mechanisms to finance innovative enterprises focussed at the bottom of the income pyramid and is geared to launch the India Inclusive Innovation Fund . 
The Fund is proposed to be operationalised with an initial corpus of Rs . 500 crore . 
Government of India has already made a provision for allocating Rs . 100 crore as seed money for the Fund . 
India has an estimated 5 , 000 small and medium scale regional industry clusters which are unable to utilize their full potential and whose productivity needs to be optimised . 
The National Innovation Council has been working towards seeding innovations in these industry clusters , while focussing on small and medium enterprises , by facilitating the creation of Industry Innovation Clusters to drive job creation and productivity . 
The Ministry of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research are also supporting the National Innovation Council in this effort . 
We look forward to the results of these interventions in enhancing the innovation quotient of the clusters and in boosting job creation . 
Inculcating and promoting the spirit of innovation in educational institutions can lay the groundwork for enhancing the impact of innovation in society and in realising our demographic dividend . 
National Innovation Council has also been taking steps to nurture innovation in schools and colleges through improvements in curriculum , spotting talented innovators among students , and awarding Innovation Fellowships . 
The Council is also working closely with the Ministry of Human Resource Development to give shape to these initiatives . 
I am pleased to learn that the Ministry plans to launch 1 , 000 scholarships under the National Innovation Scholarship Scheme from the academic year 2013 . 
I am told that the National Innovation Council and the Ministry of Human Resource Development have been working together towards the creation of a Meta University , as a global first . 
The Meta University will ride on the National Knowledge Network and will promote multi - disciplinary learning . 
I am happy that the Ministry has already facilitated the establishment of a Meta University in Delhi , in which Jawaharlal Nehru University , Jamia Milia Islamia , Delhi University and Indian Institute of Technology Delhi are participating . 
I am happy to know that Ministry of Communications and Information Technology is working on the rural broadband plans of the Government , which aim to connect all 250 , 000 panchayats in the country on a broadband network . 
This rural broadband network will constitute an unprecedented opportunity for unleashing grassroots innovation by empowering rural citizens not only through access to information , but also through relevant applications in areas such as education , health and skill development . 
While innovation is a result of networks and collaborations among multiple actors , Governments can play a key role in facilitating the right enabling framework in which these actors can interact . 
The National Innovation Council too has been working to create an institutional framework for promoting innovations in Government by facilitating the setting up of State Innovation Councils in each State , and Sectoral Innovation Councils aligned to Union Government Ministries . 
I am hopeful that this will encourage various arms of the Government to think out of the box . 
I compliment Mr Pitroda and his team at the National Innovation Council for these pioneering initiatives . 
I also appreciate the full support that the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has extended to the Council ' s endeavours . 
I wish the National Innovation Council all success as it goes forward in its task of catalysing innovation in the country . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of All India Lokayuktas Conference 2012
I am happy to participate in the inaugural ceremony of the Eleventh All India Lokayuktas Conference which brings together Lokayuktas of different States to discuss ways and means of enhancing effectiveness of Lokayuktas . 
These All India Lokayukta Conferences , bring different stakeholders together so that views can be shared on the challenges and best practices . 
With such a wide range of experienced participants , I am sure the discussions will bring forth concrete suggestions and initiatives for strengthening Lokayuktas and making them more effective . 
In recent times , there has been concern over the need to ensure that the corridors of power remain untainted by corruption or nepotism and that there is optimum utilization of resources and funds for their intended purposes . 
This national conference is therefore timely . 
For the successful working of democracy , people should be confident that Government policies are formulated and implemented with honesty , transparency and fairness . 
As all of you are aware , Lokayukta or the Ombudsman was originally conceived in Scandinavian countries as a watchdog of the administration as well as protector of the " common man " . 
Despite having minimal power to implement decisions , the Ombudsman played a very useful role in these countries by bringing humanism in governance . 
In India , Sh . M . C . Setalvad , the distinguished lawyer , in his speech at the All India Lawyer ' s Conference held in 1962 , suggested the idea of establishing an institution similar to that of an Ombudsman . 
This idea was extensively investigated by the First Administrative Reforms Commission in 1966 and while recommending setting up of Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in the States , this Commission advocated ' Ombudsmanic ' institutions as a means for redressal of citizens ' grievances , containing corruption and removing discontent amongst citizens . 
Over the years , as India witnessed rapid growth , the extent of public spending has steadily increased . 
The first five year plan outlay was Rs . 2000 crore while public investment during the 11th Plan period was around Rs . 11 lakh crore . 
As the political economy grows in size and depth , institutions conceived and established under Constitution face unique challenges . 
Ensuring sustainable growth , eliminating poverty , raising the quality of life , promoting industrialization , providing jobs etc . requires quick decision making by the Executive on whom our Constitution vests the responsibility of governance . 
If the Executive has to deliver results and demonstrate efficient governance , it needs to have substantial financial powers . 
At the same time , provision of such financial powers and the use of administrative discretion in governance gives rise to opportunities for nepotism and corruption . 
It is in recognition of the need for a mechanism which would investigate corruption amongst public persons and help bring probity in governance that Lokayuktas have been set up across the country and a Lok Pal is under consideration at the center . 
I understand at present 19 Lokayuktas have been set up by State Governments . 
I would urge the remaining states to also consider establishing similar institutions at the earliest and learn from the best practices of successful Lokayuktas within the country . 
In the States where Lokayuktas have been set up , different Acts govern their establishment and the provisions relating to the eligibility of Lokayukta , its jurisdiction , procedures , powers and infrastructure widely vary . 
There is no uniformity in the functioning of Lokayuktas of different States and their effectiveness differs from State to State . 
The fact that Lokayuktas only have recommendatory powers and no power to enforce their decisions , what should be the extent of their jurisdiction , should government servants be under their ambit or only public persons , should they have independent investigation agencies of their own or should they use existing official agencies etc . all are issues which have engendered significant debate in society . 
I am sure this conference will discuss these issues threadbare . 
The Second Administrative Reforms Commission , in its Fourth Report on " Ethics in Governance " , recommended uniformity in the general principles regarding the structure , power and functions of Lokayuktas in all the States . 
Justice Manmohan Sarin in his remarks has referred to the preparation of a Model Mukhya Lokayukta and Upalokayukta Bill for the reference of State Government . 
It is a welcome step . The Lokayuktas may also like to discuss this Model Bill with the Ministry of Law and Justice and see how the matter can be taken forward expeditiously . 
It is imperative that Lokayuktas , who are currently in office inspire confidence of the people by conducting impartial and independent inquiries in pursuit of truth . 
State Governments must facilitate the Lokayuktas in the full implementation of the legislative mandate entrusted upon them and not see them as a nuisance or interfering in governance . 
Lokayuktas must be provided adequate financial and administrative autonomy . 
The Lokayuktas must at the same time remember that their duty is not just to indict public functionaries when they are guilty but also to protect them when nothing is found wrong with their conduct and to correct wrong perceptions about them with equal force and earnestness . 
It must be ensured that in the name of checking corruption , vilification campaigns are not carried out to defame or destroy reputations . 
False allegations aimed at impugning reputations are bad . 
The institution of Lokayukta is an ally to good governance not an obstruction to development . 
Finally , let me repeat what I said in my Independence Day address to the nation earlier this year . 
Anger against the bitter pandemic of corruption is legitimate as is the protest against this plague . 
But , this should not become an excuse for an assault on our democratic institutions . 
Institutions are the visible pillars of our Constitution , and if they crack then the idealism of our Constitution cannot hold . Our institutions may have suffered from the weariness of time . 
The answer is not to destroy what has been built , but to re - engineer them so that they become stronger than before . Institutions are the ultimate guardians of our liberty . 
The judiciary of our country is the ultimate sentinel of justice and arbiter of truth and the Parliament is the custodian of the people ' s aspirations and the architect for implementing their dreams . 
Over and above the Constitutional scheme of the Executive , Legislature and Judiciary , we have , in recent times , given ourselves the Right to Information , Legal Aid , Autonomous Investigation Agencies and a host of beneficial legislation . 
The Lok Pal Bill is before the Parliament . 
New laws for imposing sanctions for bribery by foreign agents , transparency in public procurement , citizens ' grievances redressal etc are also under consideration . 
All these must strengthen existing institutions of accountability not displace them or undermine them . 
We must also distinguish bonafide errors of judgment from graft and corruption , civil wrong from criminal intent and the need to have swift and effective sanctions against corruption from the imperative of protecting the innocent . 
I am sure that the institution of Lokayuktas will emerge as a strong and an effective body in India making useful contribution to enhancing probity in governance and checking corruption as well as maladministration . 
I extend my best wishes for the success of this conference . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of presentation of Dr . Durgabai Deshmukh Award for Women ' s Development
Swami Vivekananda had said , " All nations have attained greatness by paying proper respect to women
A country and a nation which does not respect women has never become rich . " 
I am pleased to present the " Dr . Durgabai Deshmukh Award for Women ' s Development " to the four organizations whose work is being recognized today . 
It is also an occasion to reflect on the contribution made by Dr Durgabai Deshmukh to the cause of women and social development . 
She was a Parliamentarian , an institution builder and a pioneer in social development . 
She was the first Chairperson of the Central Social Welfare Board . As a Member of the Planning Commission , she endeavored to integrate , consciously and systematically , the element of social development into the planning process . 
For this task , she set up the Council for Social Development as a platform for generating new ideas and for research , advocacy and field experiments in social development . 
Dr . Durgabai believed that in the field of social welfare , the Government alone cannot initiate and carry out all the necessary measures for its citizens . 
Nor can it alone see to the preventive services that keep a society healthy . Only when spontaneous , dedicated work springs from the very soil it is linked with , can national efforts have real depth and meaning . 
The Directive Principles of State Policy provide that " the State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people " . 
Government of India , through its programmes and policies has engineered a major directional change in public policy by its focus on inclusive development . 
Government is committed to the development of the weaker and vulnerable sections of our society . 
It aims at a process of rapid and inclusive growth based on empowering the citizens of the country through education and skill development . 
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the National Rural Livelihood Mission are important initiatives to provide employment opportunities . 
Similarly , the National Urban Livelihood Mission is shifting its focus from metropolitan cities to Class One and Medium Towns . 
The National Programme for the Urban Homeless is a new scheme which will bring shelter and relief to the destitute . 
Gender budgeting has been duly integrated into our planning process to ensure that each and every developmental sector gives due emphasis to the participation of women in our nation ' s growth and progress . 
However , achievement of the desired goals can become a reality only with the concerted effort of the Government , private and voluntary sectors . 
Voluntary efforts for social welfare has deep roots in the history and heritage of India . 
Whether it is empowerment at grassroots level or emergency assistance , the voluntary sector enjoys considerable advantage due to its innovative , multi - sectoral and motivated approach . 
Voluntary organizations have played an important role in the shaping of participatory democracy in India . 
They have reached into remote and sometimes inhospitable terrain and approached weaker sections of our society with empathy and understanding . 
There has , therefore , been due attention , in our Five Year Plans , to galvanizing public cooperation through the deep and wide network of the voluntary organizations . 
Presently , the Planning Commission has initiated a Non Governmental Organisations Partnership System with the participation of about 11 Ministries and Organisations . 
These include the Ministry of Women and Child development , Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment , Ministry of Tribal Affairs , Department of Higher Education and others . 
I am sure this initiative will impact positively on sections that it is intended for . 
The organizations who have received awards today have distinguished themselves through their outstanding contribution to society . 
The Mizoram Widows Association , the Peoples Forum Association , the Sumangali Sewa Ashram in Bangalore and the Snehalaya of Ahmednagar , Maharashtra have brought hope and dignity to women and children who need the support of Government and society . 
They have given a new direction to the lives of disadvantaged sections of our society including widows , destitute women and abandoned and underprivileged children . 
They have worked in difficult and remote parts of the country rescuing and rehabilitating the exploited . 
They have given the gift of education to the deprived and underprivileged among them - and helped them to be self - reliant through vocational training , micro - credit and other assistance . 
I have no doubt that they will inspire the hundreds of other organizations like themselves , located all over India - in rural as well as urban centres . 
With these few words , I once again congratulate the Central Social Welfare Board for instituting this prestigious award . 
I offer my felicitations to the four awardees of the prestigious Dr Durgabai Deshmukh awards for the years 2005 , 2006 and 2007 and wish them success in their future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Rajyotsava Function
It is a matter of great pleasure for me to be here in Naya Raipur , the new Capital city of Chhattisgarh on the occasion of the 12th formation Day of the State . 
This is my first visit to Chhattisgarh after assuming the office of President . 
I am extremely happy that this occasion affords me the opportunity to meet a cross section of the vibrant literary and academic communities of this new and fast growing State . 
I extend my warm greetings to you all - and through you , to more than 25 million people of this young State on this auspicious occasion . 
Chhattisgarh is a new state with rich ancient history and a glorious cultural heritage . 
It is believed to be the land of Kausalya , the mother of Lord Rama and the Tapo - bhumi of Saint - Poet Valmiki . 
It is gifted by Nature with a green umbrella spread over almost 45 % of the territory . 
In addition to rich deposits of minerals such as iron - ore , aluminium , bauxite , tin , coal and even diamonds , the State is also blessed by mighty rivers such as Mahanadi , Sheonath , Sone , Hasdeo etc . 
The demographic canvas of Chhattisgarh presents a unique kaleidoscope from Sarguja in the north to Bastar in the south . 
Almost 32 % of its population is comprised of the tribals including some primitive tribes . 
It has been the center of attraction for anthropologists of various countries including the famous Varrier Alvin whom Mahatma Gandhi used to regard as his fourth son . 
Alvin spent several fruitful years of his life in Bastar and authored many important books on the life and culture of Bastar tribals . 
In order to apprise myself about the rich culture of this area , I shall also be visiting Narayanpur , the gateway to Abujmarh . 
Chhattisgarh is the State where the famous Kalchuri dynasty ruled for almost 800 years and it has a rich legacy of one of the oldest Panchayati - raj systems in the country . 
After its formation , Chhattisgarh has emerged as one of the fastest developing States in the country . 
This young state has registered all round development on many fronts and made its presence felt at the national level . 
It is heartening to know that Chhattisgarh is attracting tourists from different parts . 
It has beautiful waterfalls such as ' Chitrakote ' and ' Tirathgarh ' . 
It also has ancient religious and spiritual centers of pilgrimage like Shivrinarayan , Rajivlochan and Champaran , the birthplace of Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya . 
I am informed that a 7th century AD Buddhist Township has been unearthed in an archaeological excavation at ' Sirpur ' which speaks to the rich cultural heritage of the State . 
Swami Vivekananda spent several years of his childhood in Raipur . The largest period of his life after Kolkata was spent in Raipur . 
The great poet Rabindra Nath Tagore stayed in Pendra with his wife Smt . Mrinalini for few months . 
While waiting for the train , he wrote a beautiful poem at Bilaspur railway station which is proudly displayed there . 
Mahatma Gandhiji visited Chhattisgarh thrice during the freedom struggle and had amply acknowledged its contribution to the national Freedom Struggle . 
I salute the great freedom fighters of this land on this occasion . 
Chhattisgarh has large number of followers of two great saints , namely Sant Kabir and Guru Baba Ghasidas who have enlightened us with their profound spiritual wisdom . 
' Kabir - Chaura ' on the foothills of Amarkantak is believed to be the meeting place of Guru Nanak and Sant Kabir . 
Chhattisgarh is thus not only located at the heart of India geographically but also embodies the best of Indian culture , heritage and traditions as well as its natural beauty . 
I take this opportunity to congratulate all the prominent persons from different walks of life who have been felicitated for their important contributions in their respective fields . 
It shows that talent is abundant in Chhattisgarh which reflects its vibrant and dynamic society . 
I am delighted to know that Naya Raipur is the first planned capital city of 21st century in India and is being developed as a modern and green city . 
Special features such as rain water harvesting and harvesting of solar energy has been included to make it eco - friendly . 
Comfort and security to the citizens is being ensured through dedicated bus lanes , cycle tracks , pedestrian pathways and barrier free movement . 
A bus rapid transit system ( BRTS ) is also being developed from the initial stage to provide green and clean public transport system . 
I compliment the leadership of the State for developing the city of Raipur with vision and a commitment to sustainable urban development . 
I congratulate the people of this State on the occasion of Rajyotsava and dedicate the new Mantralaya building to the service of the people . 
I hope that Chhattisgarh will continue to live up to the expectations of the Nation and march ahead by attending to the needs of all sections of its people especially the poorest of the poor . 
In this festive season , let me conclude by wishing everybody a very Happy Diwali , may this State and you all be blessed with peace , prosperity and happiness . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of inauguration of integrated terminal building at Swami Vivekananda Airport
It gives me immense pleasure to be here in Raipur on the occasion of inauguration of the New Integrated Terminal at Raipur Airport . 
I am extremely happy that Raipur Airport has been named after the saint / philosopher and visionary Swami Vivekananda . After Kolkata , Raipur is the place Swamiji spent the largest number of years of his life . 
This year is his 150th birth anniversary and we also have only recently marked 100 years of civil aviation in India . 
It is therefore most appropriate that the Airport be named after him . 
I hope that this Airport will help build bridges between Chhattisgarh and the rest of India as well as the world . 
I am confident it will help bring a large number of tourists and business people to the beautiful and mineral resource rich state which has a hard working and talented population . 
Airports serves as gateways to the country . 
They are economic magnets which help further development and growth of the region where they are located . 
The first impression about the state of infrastructure in a city or a state comes from the facilities at the Airport . 
Airports serve as an effective medium for the movement of goods and services from one region to the other . 
It is therefore of critical importance that we build across India airports that conform to international standards and are safe , efficient , comfortable as well as convenient to passengers . 
The Aviation industry has grown world over and India is no exception . 
Air travel is no longer a luxury or the exclusive privilege of the rich . 
The rapid expansion of aviation in India has provided significant impetus to the economy . 
I am happy to know that the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports Authority of India have taken up the development and modernisation of existing airports in a mission mode . 
State Governments today also acknowledge the importance of having sufficient airports in their State to have better connectivity between various cities . 
I hope Chhattisgarh State Government , with the help of Civil Aviation Ministry and Airports Authority of India will develop more airports in the State . 
I dedicate this airport to the Nation and wish the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports Authority of India all success in their endeavours to build state - of - the - art infrastructure in the country . 
I hope that this new terminal will not only support growth and prosperity of this state but also that of the country as a whole . 
I thank Civil Aviation Ministry , Airports Authority of India and Chhattisgarh State Government for inviting me to this function . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of presentation of The National Awards , Shilp Guru Awards and Sant Kabir Awards
It is indeed a happy occasion for me to be amongst you today for presenting the National Awards , Shilpguru Awards and Sant Kabir Awards for the years 2009 and 2010 to the Master Crafts persons and Weavers . 
I congratulate all the awardees present for their contribution in preserving , promoting and enriching the traditional and cultural heritage of our country . 
I am confident that this recognition for your workmanship shall inspire and encourage others to work hard and emulate your efforts to bring prosperity to artisans and weavers across the country . 
Handlooms form a precious part of our national legacy . 
This rich heritage has been kept alive by those professionally skilled weaver households that are linked with the age - old tradition of weaving . 
Weavers with their skillful blending of myths , faiths , symbols and imagery provide their fabric an appealing dynamism . 
The strength of handloom lies in innovative designs , which cannot be replicated by the machines . 
Every part of India , every province , district and almost every single village has a cherished craft tradition of its own . 
Working on a variety of raw materials ranging from hard objects like stone and metal to soft sandalwood and clay , our craftpersons create objects of great beauty . 
What is notable is that these objects of beauty are also an integral part of the life rhythms of our people . 
Be it the great Teracotta of Bankura and embroideries of West Bengal ; the stone sculptures of Mamallapuram , Ellora and of Konark , the world - famous bronzes of the south , the intricate cane and bamboo objects made in our North - East , all of them represent the collective ethos of our civilization . 
They represent our commitment to excellence and to a higher aesthetic sense that has marked our artistic endeavors down the ages . 
Relevance of handicrafts in today ' s India is not confined to its great romance with our history and civilization . 
The fact that more than 6 million persons still practice the crafts , demonstrates the importance this sector assumes in our national economy . 
A major part of our rural populace derives their livelihood from home and cottage based activities like Handicrafts and Handlooms . 
With our agricultural sector already overburdened , the role of handicrafts and handlooms for generating income and employment cannot be over emphasized
The strength of the handlooms sector lies in its uniqueness , flexibility of production , openness to innovations , adaptability to the supplier ' s requirement and the wealth of its tradition . 
Competition from power loom and mill sector , availability of cheaper imported fabrics , changing consumer preferences and alternative employment opportunities however threaten the vibrancy of handloom sector . 
There is a need to be aware of the emerging challenges and also the opportunities presented by the changing global environment . 
A focused approach has to be adopted maximizing the opportunities and strengths inherent in the situation . 
We have to adapt to the changes that are taking place not only within the country but also globally . 
Modernization in the weaving technique , improvement of designs and pattern , access to modern tools , technology and implements , upgradation of skills to ensure quality , supply of good quality basic inputs like yarn , dyes and chemicals in time and to create a sound marketing infrastructure would not only give the required impetus but also make the products of the weavers and craftpersons more competitive . 
Simultaneously , the Government needs to provide enabling policy support which promote sustainable growth of these two important sectors of our economy . 
The Indian economy is passing through testing times on account of recent slowdown in the world economy as a whole . 
The slow down has affected many sectors . 
The Handlooms and Handicrafts sectors derive their sustenance predominantly based on human inputs , which are not easily replicable by machines . 
Herein lies the Unique Selling Proposition ( USP ) of our exquisite handlooms and handicrafts products . 
To fully harness the inherent potential of our artisans and weavers , we need to constantly endeavor to get them access to markets within India and abroad . 
Conferring of awards today is not , therefore , a mere ritual but a humble way to recognize the outstanding contribution made by the weavers and craftpersons of India to fostering creativity and bolstering the economy of our country . 
I hope when you go back to your homes you will carry a ray of hope to your fellow artisans and weavers . 
You will function as torch bearers to guide them to reach the pinnacle in pursuit of their respective crafts so that one day they too could be the proud winners of such awards . 
I take this opportunity to once again congratulate all the craftsmen and weavers who have won Awards and convey my best wishes to them for success in all their future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of inauguration of The National District Mediation Conference
I am very happy to inaugurate this National " District Level " seminar on Mediation being organized with the theme of " Role of District Judiciary in Strengthening Mediation at Institutional Level " . 
Mediation as process of dispute resolution is not new to India . Much before the British arrived , the Panchayat system of India was a forum where respected village elders assisted in resolving disputes within the community . 
Such traditional mediation continues to be prevalent in villages and our tribal communities even today . 
In pre - British India , mediation was popular among businessmen . 
Impartial and respected businessmen were requested by business association members to resolve disputes using an informal procedure , which combined techniques similar to those that exist today . 
Even though these processes lacked legal authority , such mediation processes were regularly used and commonly accepted by Indian disputants . 
The British regime brought with them the system of Anglo - Saxon jurisprudence which continues till date . 
But alternative dispute resolution processes continued to reinvent themselves post independence and in 1987 with the introduction of the Legal Services Authorities Act , we saw the revival of the ancient mediation process in the new form of Lok Adalats . 
It is important to recognize that despite the robust , independent and impartial judicial system we have in our country , the unfortunate reality is that legal disputes can be both protracted and expensive . 
There is a high degree of public frustration over the complexity of the laws , long delays and unproductive use of their resources in litigation . 
Many social conflicts have also got transformed into legal disputes , which accentuates the problem rather than resolve them . Promotion and popularisation of alternate methods of dispute settlement is therefore the need of the hour . 
Alternate dispute resolution mechanisms not only facilitate speedier justice but is also a process wherein the parties involved have control over the eventual outcome . 
This results in quick implementation of the decisions taken and eliminates continued litigation in the form of further appeals . 
Notably if a matter gets resolved by mediation , then a substantial part of the court fees deposited by the litigant also gets returned to them . 
It is for these reasons that throughout the business world , and especially in common law jurisdictions , there is a recognition that properly conducted mediations are the most effective means by which parties in civil and commercial disputes can resolve the matters that divide them . 
It is well known that mediation can play a very useful role in amicable resolution of matrimonial and family matters . 
Disputes amongst Government departments and agencies are also perhaps best resolved through out of court mediation rather than litigation . 
As Joseph Grynbaum , an acclaimed mediator of the United States has said , " an ounce of mediation is worth a pound of arbitration and a ton of litigation " . 
I compliment the Supreme Court of India for having established in 2005 the Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee and for its efforts to promote and encourage Alternative Dispute Resolution methods across the country . 
Only if Alternative Dispute Resolution becomes an integral part of the Indian justice delivery system will we be able to truly safeguard the welfare of the common man in India . 
Stakeholders need to be made fully aware of the nature , merits , limitations and consequences of their action when involved in a dispute . 
The best way to reach people early in the dispute is through disseminating information about mediation , increasing public awareness and making information on Mediation and Conciliation generally accessible and available to all . 
It is not sufficient to popularize mediation in the cities . 
Awareness needs to reach the grass roots level . 
People should be encouraged to take first recourse to mediation rather than litigation . 
There is need for endurance and perseverance on the part of the administrative as well as judicial machinery in the above regard . 
Every Society is ridden with inertia to change . 
People are aware of the options but more comfortable with the time - tested notion of litigation
Litigation has been the first option of those seeking justice and it is natural for them to move the courts for redressal of their disputes . 
However , this is where the District Courts and Judiciary can and must play a major role . 
They need to be able to convince litigants that mediation offers benefits with a human touch . 
It has no winners or losers . It has no limitations or restrictions . 
It is a pragmatic and flexible path that is in the interest of everyone involved . 
Legal education in today ' s India also needs to incorporate alternate methods of dispute resolution as an essential course for a new breed of socially conscious lawyers . 
At a personal level , as someone who has been in public service for many decades , it is my experience that most disputes become difficult to resolve due to either miscommunication or ' egoism ' of the individuals involved . 
I have always found that effective communication combined with sensitivity to the concerns of individuals concerned makes resolution of most disputes possible . 
At a very basic level , all that is required is an informal and confidential process and third party assistance that can help negotiate and amicably resolve matters in the common interest . 
It is not about cutting the pie , but making all feel victorious in the process . 
I wish the Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee all success in their endeavours to promote Alternate Dispute Resolution . 
I call upon all stakeholders gathered here to take up this cause in full earnest , building on our past traditions and keeping in mind the benefit to the common man . 
I wish this conference a great success . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of National Education Day celebrations
It is an honour for me to join you today in celebrating National Education Day . 
11th November is celebrated as National Education Day to commemorate the birth anniversary of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad , who was a great visionary , freedom fighter , scholar , secularist , eminent educationist and the first Education Minister of India . 
Dedicating this day , in this manner , is not merely the nation ' s way of remembering Maulana ' s contribution for laying the firm foundations of education in Independent India but also in visualising the path and progress that the Indian education system must take forward at all levels . 
In my opinion , it is also an occasion every year to re - dedicate ourselves through the efforts of all stake - holders to the re - discovery of India as an enriched knowledge society , carving a niche for itself in the global comity of nations . 
On this occasion , it would be appropriate to remember this great leader and recall his contribution in according high priority to education and its role in the making of a vibrant and modern India
Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was one of the most important leaders of our independence movement , who championed the cause of unity of India during and after the struggle for Independence . 
As India ' s first Education Minister , he was convinced that education is the tool of social transformation . 
Maulana Azad realised that the country could achieve a higher level of progress and advancement only by making the education system more practical , pragmatic and responsive to the immediate demands of society and industry . 
Realising the need and importance of education , he set up a number of educational commissions , boards and institutions such as the University Grants Commission and the Indian Institutes of Technology . 
When we look at the legacy of Maulana , we need to appreciate his overall contribution which was not merely confined to education , but also to various other spheres of life . 
His involvement in the Khilafat Movement gave him the opportunity to come into close contact with Mahatma Gandhi and his association thereafter is legendary . 
The significance of Maulana Azad ' s struggle becomes evident today when we recall that as a national leader , he took a tough stand against communalism . 
He strongly opposed separate electorates based on religion , and called for an independent India committed to secularism . 
He also supported the ideology of socialism , which spurred him to fight inequality , poverty and other economic problems . 
This commitment to the cause of equity and equality is what had endeared him to Pandit Nehru , who fondly addressed him as " Mir - I - Karawan " ( the caravan leader ) . 
Maulana Azad was also fully conscious about the composite cultures of India . 
Therefore , to bridge the socio - religious and cultural gaps and to enrich Indian culture and heritage , he set up a number of institutions of national importance such as Lalit Kala Akademi , Sangeet Natak Akademi and Sahitya Akademi . 
Maulana Azad was also the President of the General Conference of UNESCO in 1956 and I am glad that the Director General of UNESCO Ms . Irina Bokova is amidst us today
Another important achievement of Maulana Azad was the setting up of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations for establishing and improving cultural relations with other countries . 
I am glad that the President of the Council , Dr . Karan Singh , who is also India ' s Designate representative to the Executive Board of UNESCO , is with us today . 
The wealth of a nation , according to Maulana Azad , was not in the number of country ' s banks but in the number of primary schools . 
He was aware that the content of education in independent India had to be different from that of colonial India . 
Maulana Azad believed in a four - fold national education system - provision of basic education on a universal , free and compulsory basis , provision of adult education ; improvement and expansion of technical education ; and the reorganisation and improvement of university education at a national level . 
Maulana Azad had firm faith in the fact that every individual should have the right to education that would enable him to develop his faculties and live a full human life . 
He further said that such education was the birthright of every citizen . 
The enactment of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009 is a culmination of Maulana ' s dream . 
The Ministry of Human Resource Development is currently implementing a policy of quality education for all with special focus on marginalised and disadvantaged groups . 
The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan has a special focus on education for girls and children belonging to disadvantaged groups and weaker sections and ensuring availability of primary and upper primary schools near habitation as prescribed under the Act . 
Further , to achieve the goal of Inclusive Education at school level , the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan seeks to ensure that every child with special needs , irrespective of the kind , category and degree of disability , is provided meaningful and quality education . 
The RTE Act even provides the option of home based education for children with severe disability . 
The ' Shiksha Ka Haq ' Abhiyan launched last year on 11th of November 2011 on the occasion of the National Education Day is a drive to ensure that all schools in the country are compliant with the provisions of the Act . 
Access to elementary education is an area of priority focus in the 11th Five Year Plan . 
Presently , I am told that the number of schools has increased to 13 . 04 lakhs and the Gross Enrolment Ratio has reached close to 120 % . 
Meeting the national goals shall always be a challenge , but we have to address it in a comprehensive and effective manner . 
I am glad to note that quality of education is getting due attention under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan with more emphasis on building teacher capacity , teacher training and motivation , promoting effective pedagogy , and improving district and block level capacity for better management of the school education system . 
The successful implementation of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan has necessitated strengthening of the secondary school system through the Rashtriya Madhyamic Shiksha Abhiyan ( RMSA ) . 
This was launched in 2009 - 2010 to raise enrolment in secondary education , focus on science , mathematics and English teaching , improve retention and reduce the gender , social and regional gaps in enrolment . 
Government will focus on strengthening the capacity at secondary and senior secondary schools level . 
6000 Model schools are in the process of being set - up - of which 2500 would be under the public private partnership mode . 
The introduction of Information and Communication technology in schools will generate educational content and make it accessible to schools through the network being created under the scheme . 
Other schemes launched at secondary level will also continue to promote the objective of quality education with enhanced enrolment at this level too . 
The Saakshar Bharat Scheme launched on International Literacy Day , 8th September , in 2009 will give due focus to female literacy as well as synergy between literacy and skill development . 
It is equally vital to carry forward the important task of skill development in our youth if we want to fully realise the dividends from the demographic orientation of our country . 
I am informed that the Ministry of Human Resource Development has recently brought out a National Vocational Education Qualification Framework ( NVEQF ) which provides for horizontal and vertical mobility between the vocational education and general education . 
The task of skill building should be taken up on a very large scale so as to properly equip and motivate the youth of our country for jobs and the country ' s economic growth . 
I would emphasise that Technology Enabled Learning is a very important aspect of education . 
This must be adapted to our specific needs and introduced expeditiously in all educational institutions across the country . 
I am happy that UNESCO , in collaboration with Government of India is establishing the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Peace and Sustainable Development - which will be a Category - I Institute of UNESCO in Asia . 
It is indeed befitting that the Institute is named after the Father of our Nation , Mahatma Gandhi and is being launched today on the birth anniversary of another great Son of India , Maulana Abul Kalam Azad . 
Lastly , I would stress that we must be conscious that the outcome of our education system will be measured not merely in the number of degree holders , but in the large numbers of informed citizens that we create - enlightened citizens , who respect humanism and instinctively rise above narrow feelings of hatred , regionalism , violence , divisiveness ; and contribute gainfully to a better , stronger and vibrant India . 
As Swami Vivekananda had believed , a country ' s future depends on its people . 
To him , education was not merely collection of information , but something more meaningful ; education should give a perspective of life and build character . 
To him education was an assimilation of noble ideas . 
He is famously quoted to have said , education is not the amount of information that we put into the brain �� . . 
We must have life building , man making , character making assimilation of ideas . 
If you have assimilated five ideas and made them your life and character , you have more education than any man who has got by heart a whole library� . . 
With these few words , I extend greetings to teachers , students and stakeholders in our Education system across the nation on this Education Day . 
I congratulate the Ministry of Human Resource Development for all the initiatives they have undertaken and wish them success in policies and programmes in the years to come . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration ceremony of The 32nd India International Trade Fair
It is indeed a pleasure for me to be here at the inauguration Ceremony of the India International Trade Fair ( IITF ) - the flagship event of India Trade Promotion Organisation , that is opening its 32nd edition today . 
It was only yesterday that our country celebrated the Festival of Lights - Deepawali . 
The festival signifies not only the victory of good over evil but also the banishment of the forces of darkness and ignorance and welcoming of the light of enlightenment . 
I am happy to say that IITF , over the last 3 decades , has significantly contributed towards enlightening the world about the narration of India ' s growth . 
It has acted as a vehicle for showcasing India ' s economic and social development over the last three decades while itself gaining in popularity and moving from strength to strength . 
I congratulate the management of India International Trade Fair . 
Economic changes necessarily have social ramifications . 
In order to keep pace with the rapid global changes , we need to constantly fine - tune the skills of our work force . 
There is an urgent need to bring skill development and vocational training to the centre - stage of our developmental processes . 
In order to reach the target of skilling 500 million persons by the year 2022 , it is necessary that apart from government agencies , industry led fora address the issue of integrating skilled manpower into the mainstream of economic growth . 
India has been a model of self - reliance and a source of inspiration to many developing countries . 
Our relentless struggle to overcome poverty , illiteracy and ill - health has been watched with keen interest by the international community . 
The fact that a country with a primarily agro - based economy and a burgeoning population could make its presence felt in diverse fields such as information technology , heavy industries , communications , nuclear energy , space research , electronics , etc . , has been acknowledged and admired the world over . 
It is heartening to note that India ' s external trade , that is , merchandise exports plus imports , as a proportion of the GDP has more than doubled , from less than 20 per cent at the turn of the last century to around 45 per cent in recent years . 
It is also a matter of satisfaction that India ' s exports registered a 5 fold increase in the last decade . 
The compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of India ' s exports which was 8 . 2 % in the 1990s increased to 19 . 5 % during 2000 - 01 to 2008 - 09 . 
India ' s share in global exports also increased from 0 . 7 % in 2000 to 1 . 5 % in 2010 . Its ranking in the leading exporters improved from 31 in 2000 to 20 in 2010 . 
India has also achieved considerable diversification in its export basket and its export destinations , with countries in Asia and Africa gaining ground relatively over USA and Europe . 
The Government has also recently unveiled several policy measures designed to put the economy back on a high growth trajectory . 
Important among these have been the decisions to allow Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) in multi - brand retail and the civil aviation sector and seek legislative approval for increasing the FDI cap in the insurance and pension sectors . 
Simultaneously , measures have also been announced to keep Government ' s subsidy burden in check thereby bringing about a reduction in the fiscal deficit . 
These measures should help in restoring the economy ' s growth momentum . 
Trade Fairs of the type and scale of the India International Trade Fair have few parallels . 
IITF during its course of three decades has been a successful launching pad for a large number of consumer products - cars , durables , consumer electronics , appliances , housing to name a few . 
Most importantly , however , the fair has been an excellent platform for small and micro enterprises to showcase their products and penetrate both domestic and international markets at attractive prices without compromising with quality . 
As we know , these MSMEs are a source of rural empowerment , which is one of the key objectives of Government ' s agenda of inclusive growth . 
I am happy to note that this year ' s theme at the IITF is " Skilling India " . 
It needs no mention that skill building is an integral part of a nation ' s economic progress . 
ITPO has done commendable work in bringing all stakeholders together to share their experience at this important event . 
In my last tenure as the Union Finance Minister , I still recall that we operationalized the National Skill Development Corporation in October 2009 , with a target of skilling 15 crore persons . 
Since then it has covered a lot of ground . 
The Corporation has already made a funding commitment of more than Rs 1200 crore for various projects that are expected to train 6 . 2 crore persons in the next 10 years and augment vocational training capacity by 1 . 25 crore per year in private sector . 
By March 2012 , The National Skill Development Corporation partners had opened about 500 permanent and 2500 mobile centres in 220 districts across 24 States , thereby imparting training to 89 , 500 persons . 
I am sure that the National Skill Development Corporation will continue to build - on these initiatives . 
Finally , I would like to quote a few words from Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru , the architect of modern India , on whose birthday we celebrate the opening of the India International Trade Fair : 
We live in a wonderful world that is full of beauty , charm and adventure . 
There is no end to adventures we can have if only we seek them with our eyes open . 
I am pleased to know that Afghanistan , Bangladesh , Belarus , China , Cuba , Iran , Pakistan , Papua New Guinea , Sri Lanka , South Africa and Thailand have set up their " National Pavilion " at this Trade Fair ; and about 480 overseas exhibitors from 22 countries are participating in this year ' s event . 
I extend my heartfelt greetings and good wishes to all the participants and visitors to the 32nd India International Trade Fair , and declare the fair open . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Silver Jubilee celebration of Indira Gandhi National Centre for The Arts
I am delighted to be inaugurating the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts ( IGNCA ) , established 25 years ago in the memory of Mrs . 
Indira Gandhi . The Centre seeks to fulfil her dream and vision for India as a strong nation where civilizational values , dignity of life , respect for nature and development go hand in hand . 
The arts and all their manifestations were dear to Mrs . Gandhi . 
She said and I quote , " We know that India is what she is because art was alive here as a part of the very life of the people " . 
She further stated that there , indeed , can be no civilization without music , dance and arts ; for one is not fully , vibrantly alive without them . 
But she also envisaged heritage as something to be not merely admired and drawn upon but also to be studied in depth as a means of gaining a fuller understanding of societies and their cultural constructs . 
The IGNCA was , accordingly , established as a Centre that would encompass the study of all forms of art in all their dimensions . 
The IGNCA was , accordingly , established as a Centre that would encompass the study of all forms of art in all their dimensions . 
The Centre was inaugurated by late Shri Rajiv Gandhi , the then Prime Minister of India , who emphasised that , " the Centre has tremendous challenges . . . It has to use the most modern technology to protect and preserve the ancient " 
He was also the founder trustee of the IGNCA along with other eminent personalities like Shri R . Venkatraman , Shri P . V . Narasimha Rao and Shri H . Y . Sharada Prasad . 
The conceptual framework of the Centre , thus , took in its ambit all the diverse forms of arts and endeavoured to study them through a holistic and multi - disciplinary approach . 
It challenged the prevailing binary approaches which separated the traditional from the modern , oral from the written , urban from the rural , and folk from the classical . 
Given the times , it was a paradigm shift in the existing epistemological models in the study of art and culture . 
The Centre has been looking at the fundamental concepts of Indian thought and culture as articulated in the textual traditions and bringing out lexicons and glossaries of these concepts . 
It has compiled , edited and translated some of the more significant texts on Indian arts and aesthetics . 
Living traditions , region - and community - specific studies , lifestyles and cultural expressions of small - scale societies , their wisdom , traditions , arts and crafts and belief systems have been studied and documented with a view to link them to issues of cultural identity , education , conflict resolution and sustainable development . 
IGNCA is also providing a creative platform for fostering dialogue between the arts and current ideas in philosophy , science and technology to bridge the gap in the understanding between modern sciences and arts and culture . 
Some of the brightest minds from diverse fields have , over time , been associated with the work of the IGNCA . 
The Centre has also launched major programmes on South - East Asia , East Asia and Eurasia and collaborated with several institutions and state libraries around the world to bring together scattered manuscripts , slides , photographs etc . 
I would like to recall here Mrs . Indira Gandhi ' s words when she said : 
If you wish to know something about India , you must empty your mind of all preconceived notions of what you have heard or read . 
India is different and exasperating . . . . You will not find any of your formal labels useful . 
India is many and it is one ; it has incredible diversity yet it is bound in unity that stretches way back into unwritten history . 
IGNCA , carrying forward that thought process , has been the forbearer of many new initiatives . 
The Centre was the first to use modern day information technology to document , preserve and revitalize culture and cultural studies . 
It has held theme - based exhibitions on Space , Time , Aakaar , Prakriti , Ritu - ritam and several others . 
Its publications on fundamental texts and concepts of Indian thought reflect the Centre ' s endeavour to develop new approaches so necessary for developing a more meaningful understanding of Indian culture . 
Today , as India stands at the threshold of substantive economic progress and scientific development , the role of culture as a balancing factor between progress and the inner needs of an individual ; between his spiritual quest and material aspirations ; between technological advancement and the need to maintain ecological parity cannot be over - emphasised . 
The role of institutions such as IGNCA becomes more significant in this context . 
Institutions like IGNCA constantly need to discover and re - invent new ways of establishing a creative and meaningful dialogue between different stakeholders and adding cultural dimensions to the development debate . 
Recognising the stellar contribution of IGNCA over the years , I am happy to note that the President ' s Secretariat is presently collaborating with IGNCA for undertaking a multi - volume project on various aspects of Rashtrapati Bhavan ' s archaeological history , its making , its art and cultural artefacts . 
I wish the project all success . 
I also wish IGNCA the very best in its academic pursuits and hope that its network with the universities and institutions , both in India and abroad , would grow further . 
I am confident that IGNCA , under the able guidance of its Trust , would continue forward on its journey of excellence . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the launch of The Information , Education & Communication ( IEC ) Campaign Against Malnutrition
It gives me great satisfaction to launch the INFORMATION , EDUCATION & COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGN against malnutrition . 
I thank the previous speakers for a comprehensive introduction to the various aspects of this drive being taken up by the Ministry of Women and Child Development . 
The birth anniversary today , of late Prime Minister Shrimati Indira Gandhi , is an apt occasion for commencing this campaign . 
It is a tribute to her vision and leadership in prioritizing , through various Government programmes and policies , the numerous issues relating to the welfare of women and children in India . 
On malnutrition , she had remarked , " There are people in the world so hungry , that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread . " 
The launch of the ' IEC Campaign against Malnutrition ' today is an important and timely initiative . 
It is a matter of concern that every third woman in our country is undernourished and every second woman is anaemic . 
The inter - generational cycle of malnutrition is continuously perpetuated , with a high incidence of low birth weight - about 22 % , and greater susceptibility of infants to infection , growth failure and anaemia . 
Two out of five children - that is 42 . 5 % of children under five years in India are underweight . 
This is disturbing - and ironical - at a time when the Indian economy is on a strong positive growth trajectory . 
This anomaly is indefensible at a time when we are making rapid strides in agricultural production , biotechnology and research and development not only in agricultural sciences but also in health and medical sciences . 
These figures are a wake - up call . They underline the need for a concerted drive against malnutrition . 
Until we can ensure good nutrition and health for our children and their mothers we cannot achieve our targets of sustained and inclusive growth . 
Utmost priority must be accorded to prevent malnutrition - as early as possible and across the life cycle , to avert irreversible cumulative deficits in the growth and development of our young . 
The factors of malnutrition in India are complex . 
They include household food insecurity , illiteracy , poor environmental conditions , lack of awareness - especially among women , inadequate access to health services , safe drinking water and sanitation , and inadequate purchasing power - among a host of reasons . 
Early marriage and ignorance about nutritional needs of infants also trigger a series of causative factors . 
Clearly , a vibrant societal awareness and collective efforts of Government , complemented by grass - roots organizations is the route to preventing maternal and child malnutrition . 
At present , there is a convergence of major Government of India programmes which duly target malnutrition in women and children . 
The approach in dealing with the nutrition challenge is at two levels : firstly , the multi - sectoral , indirect approach for accelerated action on the determinants of malnutrition in all nutrition - related sectors . 
Secondly , direct and targeted interventions for specific vulnerable groups , such as children under six years , pregnant and nursing mothers as well as adolescent girls . 
There are a number of national programmes directly or indirectly contributing to improved nutrition outcomes . 
Apart from the Integrated Child Development Services , these include the Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls , the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana , National Rural Health Mission , Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan , National Rural Drinking Water Programme , Mid Day Meals Scheme , Targeted Public Distribution System , National Food Security Mission , Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the National Rural Livelihood Mission among others . 
This campaign will contribute in a significant way and give an impetus to these ongoing schemes . 
I note that the campaign has evolved through a consultative process involving concerned stake - holders . 
I understand that it will be executed in four stages to systematically inform and advise the target populations and anchor their responses in fighting malnutrition . 
I am told that Shri Aamir Khan has given probono services for the campaign and UNICEF has given technical support to the programme . 
I recognize their valuable contribution - and that of all the participants who have given their time and energy to develop the campaign . 
Creating increased public awareness of the different dimensions of malnutrition is a key requirement for the success of such a campaign . 
The mobilisation of public support is a critical requirement for preventing malnutrition through early action . 
I expect that this campaign will create an enabling social and media environment that enables families and communities to understand the malnutrition challenge very clearly - and to take informed collective action , to address it . 
Positive family care practices need to be promoted - especially those related to maternal care , child feeding , psycho - social care , health , hygiene , and importantly , care of girls and women . 
Community awareness would further motivate effective utilization of child care and health services and encourage communities to identify with and supplement Government efforts . 
I am happy to note that the launch of the campaign has coincided with the government ' s approval of Strengthening and Restructuring of Integrated Child Development Services ( ICDS ) . 
This will impact directly and positively the lives of nearly 8 crore young children under 6 years of age and 1 . 8 crore pregnant and lactating mothers in 13 . 2 lakh habitations across our country - reaching the most vulnerable and deprived . 
I recall that it was the determination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that resulted in this programme being launched in 33 community development blocks in 1975 to become today the world ' s largest and most unique programme for integrated early childhood development . 
In the Twelfth Plan - ICDS emerges as a powerful instrument for more inclusive growth relying on the Anganwadi centre as the first outpost of health , nutrition , early learning and convergence of key services at the community level . 
Our Anganwadi Workers and Anganwadi Helpers , some of whom I see gathered here today - can very effectively promote this campaign . 
I am confident that the IEC campaign will result in effective social mobilization , programme implementation and a scaling up of synergies and intersectoral convergences . 
I congratulate the Ministry of Women and Child Development who have undertaken the campaign in pursuance of the initiative of the National Council on India ' s Nutrition Challenges led by Prime Minister Dr . Manmohan Singh . 
I congratulate Smt . Krishna Tirathji , Minister , Women and Child Development , her Team and the network of field functionaries for taking this initiative to mothers , children and communities in the different parts of our country . 
With these words , I have the pleasure to launch the IEC campaign against malnutrition and extend to all those involved in its implementation my best wishes for its success . 
I am happy to inaugurate the Mannam International Centre being established here in New Delhi by the Nair Service Society . 
The founder of NSS , Mannath Padmanabhan , was a visionary and social reformer who was awarded the Bharat Kesari and Padma Bhushan . 
He fought against social evils and strove for the economic upliftment of the people of Kerala . 
He participated in the Vaikom Satyagraha in Kerala which led to streets around the Vaikom temple being opened to the socially under - privileged sections of the Hindu society as well as the Guruvayoor Sathyagraha which led to entry of underprivileged classes into temples . 
Shri Padmanabhan worked with rare zeal and single - minded devotion for the transformation of the downtrodden in society . 
He believed that caste should not be a dividing factor amongst human beings . 
A strong believer in the concept of equality of human beings and in Mahatma Gandhi ' s methods of non - violence and Satyagraha , Mannam put his organisational and oratorical skills to best use to awaken the people of Kerala , especially the Nair community out of the decadence in which they had fallen . 
Mannath Padmanabhan established and nurtured the Nair Service Society which has taken the lead in establishing numerous education institutions , medical establishments and industrial units across the state of Kerala . 
The Karayogams that Mannam established were a pioneer of modern day self help groups . 
I am glad to know the NSS has completed 98 years of existence and that the Delhi NSS has been in existence for over three decades . 
I understand the newly established Mannam International Centre will provide care for senior citizens , health care to the under privileged , temporary shelter to the needy who visit the capital and space for community functions . 
It will have a 24 hour helpline and a centre for research on the life and work of Mannam . 
I wish the Centre all success and congratulate NSS Delhi on its initiative to create such an institution to serve the needs of the under privileged . 
The NSS has a long tradition of being an organization which serves the needs of all communities . 
I am sure the Mannam International Centre will continue this glorious tradition and make its facilities available to all those in need . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of National Safety Awards ( MINES ) - 2008 , 2009 & 2010
It is indeed a pleasure for me to be here today to felicitate the award winners of National Safety Awards ( Mines ) for the years 2008 , 2009 & 2010 . 
I take this opportunity to congratulate all the award winners for recording exemplary performance in the area of mines safety . 
These awards , instituted by the Ministry of Labour & Employment , Govt of India are a token of appreciation for good work done over the years in the field of mine safety . 
I am happy to learn that the National Safety Awards are becoming increasingly popular in mines all over the country . 
This exemplifies the resolve on the part of all mines in the country to promote a safer and better working environment through voluntary initiatives . 
The twin concepts of " Self - regulation " and " Workers ' Participation in Safety Management " have resulted in a steady decline in fatality rates over the several decades which is quite encouraging . 
However , there can be no room for complacency in this regard particularly since safety issues , and their associated complexities , are increasing with expansion of mining activity , intensive mechanization and extension of mining activity to adverse geo - mining locales . 
The mining industry occupies an important position in the national economy by not only employing over one million persons but also producing basic raw materials for many industries , including the core sector . 
The mineral sector contributed 5 . 0 % of our national GDP during 2010 - 11 . 
The industrial climate of the country and the overall economic scenario is undergoing substantive change which , I hope , will also result in the mining industry benchmarking itself to global efficiency parameters through improvements in efficiency , productivity , safety and health standards . 
The last millennium had witnessed some of the greatest changes in recorded history . 
The millennium began in the middle ages , then progressed through the industrial revolution , the age of science , and now , the new millennium is rapidly trying to catch up with the information age . 
This is a time of introspection . Issues such as increased mechanization , emphasis on protection of environment , stringent social demand on safety at workplaces , large scale introduction of information technology in mining industry , more difficult geo - mining locales and cost considerations pose serious challenges to the mining industry in India . 
In this changed scenario , all stakeholders will constantly need to be a step ahead of the learning curve and continuously re - invent business and technological processes . 
A developing economy needs increased availability of power to sustain a higher growth rate . 
A GDP growth rate of 9 per cent per year has been envisaged over the Twelfth Plan period of 2012 - 17 . 
This would necessitate a growth in the total energy supply by around 6 . 5 per cent per year . 
The total requirement of Oil in the country in 2010 - 11 was 164 . 32 million tonne , with as much as 76 % being met through imports . 
The oil requirement could increase to 205 million tonne per year by the end of the Twelfth Five Year Plan , with around 80 % of it to be met by imports . 
This would be unsustainable for the economy , with implications on its fiscal balance as well as its targets for growth and development . 
India is fortunate to have been blessed with vast coal resources . 
The country has 118 billion tonne of proven coal reserves as of 1st April 2012 . 
At the present level of production , these reserves could last for around 200 years . 
As of now , coal meets around 52 % of the total energy requirement in the country . 
The total energy requirement in the country in 2016 - 17 that is the terminal year of the Twelfth Five Year Plan is estimated at around 738 million tonne of oil equivalent . 
To meet our developmental needs and vast requirement of energy , the country in the next 10 - 15 years will have to rely more and more on coal . 
In fact , coal should occupy a predominant position in our sources of energy supply . 
However , to make increased dependence on coal a sustainable phenomenon , we will have to move towards cleaner technologies so that environment is not unduly stretched . 
The added emphasis on information technology will also profoundly impact the manner in which the mining industry shall function in the future by simplifying work processes , on the one hand and bringing about cost reduction and productivity improvements , on the other . 
Moving into the 21st century , one can envision a restructured mining industry with multiple players . 
We also need to recognize that in today ' s competitive environment , only cohesive , focused and , work - oriented organizations will survive . 
I am sure that the mining industry will measure up to the challenges of our times . 
I am confident that the National Safety Awards ( Mines ) will prove to be an excellent catalyst in upholding health , safety and welfare standards in our mines . 
I once again congratulate all the award winners for their splendid efforts in encouraging mine safety
The presentation of the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize for Peace Disarmament and Development for the year 2010 is a key event in the calendar of global peace , development and disarmament . 
Today , we recognize and honour a contemporary world leader for his substantial contribution towards the achievement of these universal aspirations . 
This prestigious award celebrates the legacy of the Late Shrimati Indira Gandhi as an untiring crusader for global peace , universal disarmament and a new international economic order . 
She won the mandate of the Indian people at a time in our recent history when our country was faced with serious domestic and external challenges . 
In her characteristic style , she approached these with due urgency , armed with the principles that Mahatma Gandhi taught and lived by - and the policies of her visionary father , Jawaharlal Nehru . 
For me personally , this day is a reminder of my own association with one of the most dynamic Prime Ministers of modern India , a tall leader acclaimed internationally , whose dedication and commitment to the people that she represented was unparalleled . 
Shrimati Gandhi was very clear that India had to be self reliant and that her first concern always was national interest . 
In the socio - economic development of India , Shrimati Indira Gandhi reached out to the poorest and the most deprived . 
Her call for " Growth with Social Justice " became a motto for her Government . 
It drove home the point that growth in India had to go hand in hand with equitable distribution of its benefits . 
It made prudent management of resources and revenues a priority - as also the creation of institutions and programmes for social change such as empowerment of Panchayati Raj institution , strengthening of public distribution system , initiating of mid - day meal schemes for school children , empowerment of scheduled castes and tribes among others . 
It was Shrimati Indira Gandhi who steered India ' s State and business sectors into a co - operative alliance for economic growth . 
Improving production was her top priority , she put out a new industrial policy to encourage expansion and also provided finance and tax relief to encourage investment . 
Special legislations were passed to discourage strikes and labour unrest . 
The nationalization of banks not only helped to increase household savings but it also provided considerable investments in the informal sector , in small and medium enterprises and agriculture . 
Thanks to her bold initiatives , the Indian economy today , is more resilient and confident . 
wo decades of steady economic reforms have contributed to an improvement in average income and consumption levels in both rural and urban areas . 
There is a new - found dynamism in some of the most backward areas - bringing them into the national economic mainstream . 
Environment and energy were high priority issues on Mrs . Gandhi ' s agenda . 
I recall that once she had written to Chief Ministers of all the States suggesting a drive to plant a tree for every child . 
She stressed the value of traditional energy - saving technologies - and welcomed the development of new technologies and their adaptation to India ' s needs . 
At the global level , Smt . Indira Gandhi , while meticulous in her attention to detail , had a very clear perspective . 
She was a firm believer that only with coexistence could there be any existence at all . 
I would like to recall her words that are so relevant today . 
She said , and I quote , " We regard non - interference and non - intervention as basic laws of international behaviour . 
Yet different types of interventions , open or covert , do take place in Asia , in Africa , in Latin America . 
They are all intolerable and unacceptable . Interference leads to intervention and one intervention often attracts another . 
Each situation of conflict has its own origins . 
Whatever they be , solutions must be political and peaceful . 
All States must abide by the principle that force or the threat of force will not be used against the territorial integrity or political independence of another state . 
Our plans for a better life for each of our peoples depend on world peace and the reversal of the arms race . 
Her theme remained constant - the interrelation of security , development and the environment . 
She believed that nationalism should not detach peoples from common humanity . 
She was convinced of the need to create " a new international order of humanity where power is tempered with compassion , where knowledge and capability are at the service of all humanity . " 
As Chairperson of the Non Aligned Movement , she had remarked , while addressing the United Nations in 1983 , that " the safety of the weak is the strength of the strong " . 
Shrimati Indira Gandhi firmly believed that smaller nations had a key role in determining the future of the world . 
She referred to developing countries as " the step - children of the Industrial revolution " and said that they needed to be given due justice . 
In pursuing India ' s aims , she never acted against the aspirations of other developing nations or compromised their priorities . 
She held that the myriad problems related to the environment , optimal utilization of global resources and the reorganization of political and economic systems needed the co - operative endeavours of the whole world community . 
Shrimati Indira Gandhi shall be remembered for her untiring efforts at maintaining cohesion , unity and enhanced economic co - operation among developing nations , their autonomous development , collective self reliance and equitable and democratic dialogue between the North and South . 
In her interventions at international fora , she was admired as a moderator and conciliator . 
In awarding the prize for 2010 to President Lula , we are honouring today an outstanding champion of the developing world . 
President Lula has been a transformative figure in Brazil . 
With his own unique life story of rising from humble origins to the highest level in the country and to international recognition as a world Statesman , he has inspired millions of his countrymen . 
Their faith in participatory democracy and in effective governmental intervention for development were strengthened by his actions . 
As a man of vision , he dreamed of comprehensive development for Brazil and made eradication of hunger and alleviation of poverty his imperatives . 
With energy and perseverance , he challenged the structural causes of food shortages and achieved food security for his people . 
He has been a champion of ' inclusive growth ' in Brazil , a policy that is akin to our own approach . 
Through social programs like Bolsa Familia and Fome Zero , hallmarks of his Presidency , President Lula has conceived and popularized models for effective delivery of financial benefits to poor families but expected them to fulfill some essential social requirements . 
Today Brazil is one of the front ranking economies and more than 20 million Brazilians have been lifted out of acute poverty due to these innovative and well administered programs . 
With the continuation of these policies by President Dilma Rouseff , a close colleague and friend of former President Lula , Brazil is on its way to becoming a ' middle class ' country , the stated aspiration of its leaders . 
President Lula is also credited as having changed significantly Brazil ' s international profile . 
His energetic and dynamic international engagement has been anchored on empathy and solidarity with the developing world . 
Starting with all of South America and with efforts at greater unity in the countries of that continent , President Lula forged stronger links with Africa recognising the historical and economic bonds of Brazil with many African countries . 
He has been a force in the evolution of new fora that bring together major emerging economies including India and Brazil . 
President Lula has thus greatly contributed to the cause of the developing countries and to the self - realisation of the commonalities and convergent interests of the major emerging economies . 
Brazil will come under even greater world attention in the coming years as the host of the FIFA world cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016 . 
Your Excellency , President Lula , allow me to state that it is a moment of great satisfaction for me to present the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize for 2010 to you . 
I understand that the international jury had been unanimous in their choice . 
You are a true visionary of the 20th century . 
You are regarded as the most popular politician in the history of Brazil and one of the most popular world figures . 
Through your inclusive policies and your perseverance through the " Lula Institute " to promote democracy , social inclusion combined with economic development , you have been an example and an inspiration to many leaders the world over . 
The formation of IBSA and south - south co - operation are manifestations of your contribution to the strengthening of co - operation between developing countries of Africa , Asia and South America . 
It was your foresight that infused a momentum to the integration of Latin America and the Caribbean . 
The formation of the Community of the Latin American and Caribbean States fulfills the desire of the people and the will of the nations in your region to carve out their own destiny . 
The people of India hold you in high esteem . You have been a sincere friend of India . 
It was during your Presidency that relations between India and Brazil steadily progressed and the seeds were sown of a close partnership in the IBSA , BRIC , G - 20 and BASIC . 
Our bilateral cooperation has strengthened significantly in recent years - and we are today in a strategic partnership of a privileged nature , engaged in realizing its full potential for our mutual benefit . 
Our two way trade flow today is over 9 billion USD . We look at Brazil as an important partner in achieving energy security , food security , as a source of raw material for our industry end enhanced co - operation in science and technology as well as higher education to accelerate the development processes in both our countries . 
The commonalities between our countries is truly striking : we are the largest democracies in our continents i . e . Asia and Latin America ; we both have enormous diversity - ethnic , cultural and religious ; cultural vibrancy and family ties are important in both our societies , and above all we face the challenges of development . 
In recent years , our economies have been growing and today we are major economies in terms of GDP , but we both face regional and income disparities . 
It is therefore inevitable that often our perspective on global issues are similar be it with regard to democratisation of the world order , issues relating to international trade at the WTO or climate change . 
We share a strong commitment to nuclear disarmament and the global elimination of all weapons of mass destruction . 
We are united in our belief in dialogue and consultation as the best path to the resolution of disputes . 
Our relationship has therefore been termed as ' natural and necessary ' . 
Your Excellency , President Lula , at this critical juncture in world affairs , as we confront economic uncertainty , food scarcity , increasing competition for the world ' s resources , political instability and terrorism , it is men of vision , integrity and clarity of purpose who can instill faith among their fellow men , find solutions and show the way . 
Your policies have always been inclusive and your perseverance inspiring
Our Government and people applaud your selfless labour for your people and for mankind . 
May you long continue to play an active role in global affairs . 
I once again congratulate you and wish you good health and success in all your future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of The International Conference on " Sustainable Agriculture for Food and Livelihood Security " at Punjab Agricultural University
It is indeed a privilege for me to be present here to extend to the faculty and students of the Punjab Agriculture University , my felicitations and best wishes on the 50th Anniversary of this great institution . 
This is my first visit to Punjab in my present capacity . 
I had indeed looked forward to being here - amongst the distinguished scientists and experts present today . 
This Institution is synonymous with the Green Revolution which transformed Indian agriculture , making our country self reliant in feeding its population . 
Today , we produce enough to spare for export and assistance to other developing countries . 
It is the Punjab Agricultural University that pioneered agricultural research and technology dissemination in our country - at a time in the ' 60s when this was a crucial need . 
Its scientists engaged with a sense of urgency in research , innovation and foreign collaborations . 
They have since developed hundreds of new strains , high yielding and robust varieties of crops and studied the management of environmental , weather and soil conditions . 
I congratulate the Punjab Agriculture University for its splendid contribution in the service of our nation . 
The agriculture sector in India continues to be the lifeline of our people and a key factor in our economy ' s overall productivity . 
It has rightly been accorded due priority in every budget and Plan for achieving India ' s developmental goals . 
Government of India has , over the decades , introduced a variety of schemes and measures to give support to the entire agriculture sector from small farmers to large investors . 
Institutions and banks have been created to focus on supporting agriculture development , fixing remunerative prices and improve agricultural marketing . 
The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices and the Food Corporation of India have been set up to recommend Minimum Support Prices and procure grains for public stocks respectively , the NABARD and Regional Rural Banks to ensure easy and adequate credit availability , and programmes such as the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna , National Food Security Mission and National Horticulture Mission have taken the Government ' s outreach to the farthest and remotest regions . 
Promoting inclusive growth , sustaining food security and boosting rural incomes in the country is intrinsically linked to growth in the Agriculture sector . 
As the Finance Minister , I had outlined a four - pronged strategy as part of the Union Budget for 2010 - 11 to drive growth in the Agriculture sector . 
The first component of the strategy was to extend the green revolution to the Eastern region of the country comprising Bihar , Chhattisgarh , Jharkhand , Eastern Uttar Pradesh , West Bengal and Orissa . 
The second component of the strategy was to reduce the significant wastage in storage as well as in the operations of the existing food supply chains in the country . 
The third component was to improve credit availability to the farmers , while the fourth component was to aim at providing a further impetus to the development of the food processing sector by providing state - of - the - art infrastructure and substantial fiscal incentives . 
The initiative of bringing green revolution to Eastern India has resulted in a significant increase in production of paddy , as States in Eastern India reported additional paddy production of 7 million tonnes in Kharif 2011 . 
The total paddy production in the country increased from 95 . 98 million metric tonnes in 2010 - 11 to 104 . 32 million metric tonnes in 2011 - 12 . 
Mr . Robert S . Zeigler , Director General of the International Rice Research Institute in Manila lauded our achievement when he mentioned that " the most heartening aspect of India crossing the 100 million tonne rice production mark is that a major contribution has been from Eastern India " . 
The total food grains production in the country increased from 244 . 78 million metric tonnes in 2010 - 11 to 257 . 44 million metric tonnes in 2011 - 12 . 
To reduce wastage in storage , concrete steps have been taken by the Government to create additional food grain storage capacity in the country . 
Two million tonnes of storage capacity in the form of modern silos have already been approved for creation . 
Further , nearly 15 million tonnes of storage capacity is being created through private entrepreneurs and warehousing corporations . 
To enable the timely availability of affordable agriculture credit to the farmers , the target for flow of agriculture credit has been enhanced in the Union Budgets from time to time , from Rs . 3 , 75 , 000 crore in 2010 - 11 to Rs . 5 , 75 , 000 crore in 2012 - 13 . 
The Mega Food Park scheme , which was introduced in the Eleventh Plan , aims at developing farm proximate state of the art infrastructure with strong backward and forward linkage in a demand driven manner . 30 Mega Food Parks are being planned for creation in this financial year . 
At the present juncture , we have come a long way . 
The growth rate of GDP in Agriculture and allied activities in 2011 - 12 is 2 . 8 per cent which is , of course , lower than the growth rate of 7 per cent in 2010 - 11 but higher than the growth rates of 0 . 4 per cent in 2008 - 09 and 1 . 7 per cent in 2009 - 10 . 
There is however , a reality that cannot be ignored - and I take this opportunity to call upon all present here today to reflect on why , despite all these successes and efforts and despite India ' s overall improved economic performance , the economic viability of this sector is still a challenge . 
There are , even today , so many regions in our country where subsistence farmers and small farmers remain susceptible to failure , risk and desperation . 
Despite various programmes and schemes of Government - complemented by the efforts of the scientific and corporate community , why is it that prosperity has eluded a large part of this sector ? 
It is ironical that although India is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world , value addition to this produce is just 7 per cent and processing only around 3 per cent of production . 
There is hardly any value addition at the farm level - and 98 per cent of farm produce is sold as it is harvested . 
Due to our tropical / subtropical conditions , more than 25 % of production is lost during harvest and post harvest operations . 
We import a large amount of the pulses we consume . 
In the agriculturally advanced regions , there are problems of over - exploiting ground water resources and vulnerability to pests and crop diseases ; over - mining of nutrient reserves has led to multi - nutrient deficiencies . 
Excessive use of fertilizers is taking its toll on the productivity of soil . 
I recall a comment of Mahatma Gandhi which made a profound impression on me : 
He said , and I quote , " A farmer cannot work without applying his mind . 
He must be able to test the nature of his soil , must watch changes of weather , must know how to manipulate his plough skillfully and be generally familiar with the movements of the stars , the sun and the moon . . . . " 
This is a compelling reason for the Indian farmer to be provided the wherewithal that he urgently needs - the financial , technological , infrastructural , transportation and other requirements for a sustainable approach for the increased productivity that we seek . 
In this context , I take this opportunity to share a few thoughts on the challenges that we must address . 
We need to do a re - think on agriculture in India . And we need to do this urgently to ensure food security in India . 
We must have in place a coherent and comprehensive policy that has synergy among its various elements . 
Government initiatives are of little use without efficient systems for their implementation . 
Equally important is the necessity for collaboration between the state and central governments on the monitoring and appraisal of various schemes . 
A co - ordinated and integrated approach should start at the grassroots , taking into account all the factors . 
Many policies are susceptible to failure because of inaccurate feedback . 
Collation of information and policy integration is essential . 
As I am among academia and experts , I would like to suggest that we identify the priorities and act swiftly . 
I would put training and entrepreneurship development high in my list of items requiring urgent attention . 
To this I would add the task of developing and reaching appropriate technology to farmers , agriculture marketing reforms , studying the present yield gaps and methods to harvest wastelands , address wastage and overuse of fertilizers and develop simple IT tools for farmers - that are user friendly and can provide relevant and timely information relating to weather forecasts . 
Enhanced productivity would reduce per unit cost , enhancing the global competitiveness of our produce . 
Farm mechanization , linking farms with markets and adding value at each stage will help in employment generation , entrepreneurship development , increased profits to farmers and safe and healthy food to consumers . 
Investments in food processing sector have multiplying benefits for all , and hence a major boost needs to be given to the processing sector . 
Fiscal incentives and land leasing policies of State Governments should be such that agro - processing , especially in the rural areas , becomes a lucrative option both for the farmers and the private sector . 
A useful part of the re - assessment would be a mapping and indexing of crops and livestock to anticipate market demands , plan resource allocation and ensure its optimal utilisation to ensure maximum output . 
This would give an edge in the global market . Similarly , the agro - industry , in partnership with research institutions can plan relevant and standardised crop production and efficient agricultural supply chains , which are vertically integrated . 
Improved connectivity between agricultural universities and the farmers could be very beneficial for both . 
Most importantly , innovation - of new varieties , technologies and methods for post harvest processes - - should move up on our priority list . 
he percentage of GDP from Agriculture and allied activities spent on research and development must be increased from the current level of 0 . 6 per cent to 1 . 0 per cent in the Twelfth Five Year Plan . 
I believe that a multi - pronged strategy involving technology development , new marketing methods , precision in farm operations and innovative policy instruments is required to ensure agricultural sustainability and food and livelihood security and I would stress the importance of due attention to modernising food storage and its distribution . 
This Conference on Sustainable Agriculture for Food and Livelihood Security is , therefore , an important opportunity for stakeholders to review the current overall approach and , develop an updated , comprehensive strategy to accelerate agricultural growth and further strengthen national food and livelihood security in India
I also take this opportunity to convey my best wishes to the students and faculty for success in all their endeavours in years to come . 
With these words , I have the pleasure to formally inaugurate this conference . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Lakshmipat Singhania - IIM , Lucknow National Eadership Awards - 2011
I am extremely delighted to be amongst all of you today for the presentation of the Lakshmipat Singhania - IIM Lucknow National Leadership Awards 2011 . 
I take this opportunity to congratulate the JK Organization and the Indian Institute of Management , Lucknow for instituting these Awards in three major categories viz . Business , Science and Technology and Community Service and Social Upliftment . 
I am told that since the inception of the awards in 2004 , eminent Indians have been honoured for their leadership qualities and contributions to Indian society in these three categories . 
Each one of the award winners today have distinguished themselves by their excellence and achievements and are role models for the nation . 
I offer my congratulations and best wishes to each of them . 
IIM Lucknow over the last 25 years has emerged as a leading institution not only for management education but also for research and consultancy activities . 
Apart from Leadership Development , it is also committed to piloting several socially relevant research and consultancy projects in agriculture , entrepreneurship , health management , education , IT and rural development . 
Late Lakshmipat Singhania , in whose honour this Award has been instituted , was a visionary and a business leader with outstanding qualities . 
His entrepreneurial spirit and contribution to Indian business and society at large is well known and bears no repetition
It is thus appropriate that the two organisations namely IIM - Lucknow and JK Organisation should join hands in instituting the National Leadership Awards in the memory of Late Lakshmipat Singhania . 
I still remember when Netaji , as President of the 51st Session of Indian National Congress in Haripura , on the banks of the river Tapti , reminded us that " our chief national problems are eradication of poverty , illiteracy and disease " . 
Freedom then meant political and economic freedom . 
Political freedom was won by a generation of giants , led by Mahatma Gandhi , who fought with selfless , unflinching conviction against British rule . 
Pt . Jawaharlal Nehru , Baba Saheb Ambedkar , Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel , Maulana Abul Kalam Azad , Sarojini Naidu and many others charted the road - map of independent India . 
Corporate leaders like Lala Lakshmipat Singhania , JRD Tata , G . D . Birla similarly contributed in ensuring economic development . 
India has come a long way since then . Various policies and initiatives , including economic reforms , have brought about significant improvements in living standards as also quality of life . 
As a country , however , we face many challenges as we march forward . 
There are still many areas and regions where economic growth is lagging behind and where social parameters are much lower than the rest of the country . 
For India ' s political and economic stability , it is important that we have truly " inclusive " growth - growth that benefits each and every citizen of the country especially those who are at the margins of society and at the base of the socio - economic pyramid . 
The challenges being large and diverse , India needs grass - root leaders who place people and their problems at the centre of the social , economic and political discourse . 
It is only when we work together and each Indian feels empowered to contribute to the task of nation building that we shall be able to combat poverty , malnutrition , hunger and disease . 
India today stands at the cusp of greatness - while there are many challenges ahead , there are also boundless opportunities . 
We are passing through a phase of unprecedented demographic change which is likely to contribute to a substantially increased labour force . 
The bulk of this increase is likely to take place in the relatively younger age group of 20 - 35 years which would make India one of the youngest nations in the world . 
In 2020 , the average Indian will be only 29 years old as compared to an average age of 37 for China and the US , 45 for West Europe and 48 for Japan . 
It is clear that the youth of India , who are the leaders of tomorrow , shall aspire for higher standards of living , better service delivery and increased transparency and accountability . 
They must , however , not only be the beneficiaries of this change process but also the drivers of it . 
For this to happen it is necessary that the State , in partnership with the private sector , provides opportunities for education , skill - enhancement and capacity building . 
There is also a special need to empower women who shall act as catalysts for change . Recognising this , the 11th Five Year Plan sought to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive strategy for inclusive development , building on the growing strength of the economy in the past decades . 
It is necessary that India provides quality education to its population in order to reap the full benefits of the demographic dividend . 
The 12th Plan Approach Paper accordingly focuses on teacher training and evaluation and measures to enforce accountability . 
It also stresses the need to build capacity in secondary schools to absorb the pass - outs from expanded primary enrolments . 
The Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education must be targeted to increase from nearly 18 % at present to about 25 % by 2016 - 17 . 
I am aware that there are many challenges associated with land acquisition , township planning , project approval , construction and transfer of assets to beneficiaries . 
There is a need to look at the systems in place and provide solutions to make the dream of providing houses to the economically weaker sections of the society a reality . 
Special emphasis should be laid on the adoption of innovative technologies , designs and materials to speed up delivery at reduced cost . 
Skill development is another important area that has particular relevance to the housing industry , where new technologies have to be adopted and higher volumes achieved . 
Government and industry must join hands in finding solution to this challenge . 
National Skill Development Corporation is engaged in this task and its effort must be further supplemented by the real estate industry to achieve optimal results . 
Finally , I reiterate that housing and real estate sector holds the key to economic prosperity of the country because of its backward and forward linkages with other sectors of economy besides serving an important social goal . 
This sector is rightly termed as engine of economic growth . 
I hope that this gathering of experts and important stake holders will deliberate and find workable solution to meet the housing need of Aam Adami . 
There is the need for all stakeholders to join hand and work for achieving the objective of housing for all . 
Not only is it an economic imperative , but Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights casts a bounden duty on us to ensure that " Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well - being , of himself and of his household , including food , clothing and shelter " and we should not be found wanting in our efforts to achieve this goal . 
I wish the Convention all success . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of the presentation of Sixth Biennial Excellence Awards to The Cooperative Societies
It gives me great pleasure to present National Cooperative Development Corporation Biennial Cooperative Excellence Awards 2012 to the cooperative societies in the International Year of Cooperatives , 2012 . 
At the initial stage , I would like to congratulate all the award winners for their achievements which have been recognized both at the State and National level . 
These awards , initiated in 2002 , promote the spirit of competition amongst the grass - root level cooperatives and recognize their distinct role in socio - economic development . 
I note that this year the NCDC has instituted three new National Level Awards for Cooperative Excellence . 
I congratulate the societies selected for NCDC Biennial Awards for Cooperative Excellence . 
I am sure that these awards would inspire other cooperative societies in the country in instilling a new sense of hope and bringing renewed vitality and vibrancy in these cooperatives enabling them to perform even better in the days ahead . 
The history of cooperative movement in India is more than a hundred years old . 
Even before formal cooperative structures came into being , the practice of cooperation and cooperative activities were prevalent in India
Village communities collectively created common assets like village tanks or village forests , pooled seeds and shared their collective harvest . 
It was in the latter part of the 19th century that agricultural conditions combined with the absence of institutional financing arrangements led to the deep indebtedness of the Indian farmer . 
In response to this , various Government initiatives were taken - including the Cooperative Credit Societies Act of 1904 . But it was in October 1946 , that history was made when two Primary Village Milk Producer Societies were registered . 
This was followed by the registration , the same year , of the Khera District Cooperative Milk Producers Union known as Amul . 
After India attained Independence in 1947 , cooperative development received due recognition and cooperatives were given a central role in the Five Year Plans formulated by the Planning Commission of India particularly for the transformation of the rural economy . 
Cooperatives in our country are pivotal institutions for bringing socio - economic development for inclusive growth in rural areas . 
The co - operative movement helped our founding fathers who gave it a prime place in the process of economic development of the country . 
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru envisioned India vibrant with the cooperative movement to make it , broadly speaking , the basic activity of India in every village as well as elsewhere , and finally , indeed , to make the cooperative approach the common thinking of India . 
Therefore the whole future of India really depends on the success of this approach of ours to these vast members of hundreds of millions of people . 
He visualized an India in which each village would have a Panchayat , a cooperative and a school . 
Today , with a net - work of six lakh cooperatives and a membership base of 24 crores , the Indian cooperative movement has proved to be an effective economic instrument for ensuring growth with equity and inclusiveness . 
Cooperatives in India have made a visible and significant contribution to the overall economic growth of our economy . 
This is especially so in the sectors of agricultural credit , sugar , dairy , textiles , fisheries , distribution of fertilizers and agricultural inputs , storage and marketing . 
They have ensured the accrual of a fair share of the benefits of development and growth to our small and marginal farmers . 
Recognizing the advantages and its importance world over , United Nations declared 2012 as the International Year of Cooperatives , to increase public awareness about cooperatives and their contributions to socio - economic development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and also to promote the formation and growth of co - operatives . 
This year is also coinciding with the Golden Jubilee year of the NCDC and therefore this award function assumes special significance for the growth of co - operatives . 
During these 50 illustrious years , NCDC basically a financing institution for providing financial assistance exclusively to the cooperatives , achieved new milestones and undertook many initiatives with the ultimate goal of developing the rural economy and removing the incidence of backwardness from the rural hinterland of the country . 
The Cooperatives in our country face many challenges and problems ; their performance across sectors , activities , and regions is variable ; they need to re - orient themselves by improving their efficiency , and have to develop themselves professionally to meet the requirements of their core clientele - farmers , growers , artisans , producers and women . 
However , the cooperatives are perhaps still best way of reaching out into the vast hinterland of this country where the poor and the marginalized sections . 
Recently , the Government has taken a big initiative for the cooperatives by enacting the 97th Constitutional Amendment thereby creating an enabling environment for the development of the Cooperatives . 
This would enable democratic , autonomous and professional functioning of the cooperatives . 
By this amendment the right to form cooperative society has now become a fundamental right . 
The act has paved the way for development of a stronger cooperative movement . 
To take this initiative further to the grass root level respective State Governments also need to create enabling environment by amending State laws etc as and when it is necessary . 
In conclusion I once again congratulate the award winners . 
I compliment Shri Sharad Pawar , Union Minister of Agriculture & Food Processing Industries and his Ministries for their continuous efforts for sustained economic development of our economy through the cooperatives . 
I would like to conclude my observations by quoting from the last Sookta of Rig - Veda , which so aptly captures the spirit of ' cooperation ' in its truest sense : 
May we all have common purpose
May our hearts be in unison
May we all be of the same mind
So that we can do our work efficiently and well . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Fourth Convocation Ceremony of Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya
It is a matter of great pleasure to be here today and share my thoughts with you on this fourth Convocation Ceremony of the Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya . 
I am overwhelmed by the serene environs of the holy Ganges and the mighty Himalayas in which your institution is located . 
I offer my felicitations to the students who have received their degrees , awards and medals today . 
I would also like to avail of this occasion to record my appreciation for the great strides that Vishwavidyalaya has achieved in a short span of a decade . 
Its mission of unifying contemporary education with spiritual training to mould well - rounded individuals is laudable , for its relevance in today ' s world . 
Education adds value to a person ; and value based education equips us to contribute in a meaningful way to our society . 
In this age , striving for spiritual development along side academic excellence is the right approach to regain lost values and traditions . 
Shantikunj , the social service organization that founded Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyala , has done a great service by establishing this institution to promote these social objectives . 
I am also delighted that your institution mandates every student to undertake a course on Life Management to imbibe social responsibility through internship programmes . 
Institutionalizing life - based knowledge and exposure through the medium of academic curricula is a practice that is worthy of emulation . 
By endowing the students with the diverse perspectives of life , this Vishwavidyalaya seeks to give them an in - depth world view of modernity . 
It is the innovative ideas and the holistic education that Vishwavidyalaya imparts which has made it a centre of excellence that attracts students from India and abroad ; including Russia , Iran , Germany , Nepal , Sri Lanka , Japan , Spain , Czech Republic , China and South Korea . 
Today , as I saw bright young men and women receiving their degrees , I was reminded of a quote by Mahatma Gandhi who said : 
Live as if you were to die tomorrow . 
Learn as if you were to live forever . 
The spirit of these wise words is what I would urge you to take away , as you all gear up to face realities of this world . 
You must develop on these values that this great Vidyalaya so resplendently embodies and practices . 
I would also like to pay my respects to Pandit Shri Ram Sharma Acharya , whose philosophical teachings and remarkable vision have been the inspiration behind the establishment of this institution . 
The reverence towards the ' Guru ' led to this beautiful experiment of harmonizing education with spirituality . 
Through spiritual regeneration , Pandit Acharya strove to inculcate in the people , high social and moral values leaving an indelible mark in the minds of multitudes . 
Our country is fast becoming a great economic power . 
In terms of Purchasing Power Parity ( PPP ) , we are the third largest economy in the world . 
The growth rate that our country enjoys is second only to China among the major economies in the world . 
In six out of the last nine years , we managed a growth rate in excess of 8 % . 
Though the growth rate had slightly contracted since 2010 - 11 in the face of global economic meltdown , India has been able to withstand the crisis and has shown a remarkable resilience . 
It is the growth of education in India that is one of the key factors responsible for India ' s resilience . 
Therefore , it is indisputable that education through which we build intellectual capital is of singular importance to any individual , society or nation . 
It helps skilled workforce to contribute directly to the nation ' s output . 
Research is a finer product of education , leading to innovation , technological advancement and process perfection , which are responsible for shifting the production frontiers , creating greater capacity for future growth . 
Thus , the value of education can never be exaggerated . 
In the field of higher education , India has 659 degree awarding institutions and 33 , 023 colleges
At the end of the Eleventh Five Year Plan period , there were a total of 172 Central Institutions that award degrees . 
The number of such Institutions has increased by 65 during the Eleventh Plan period of 2007 to 2012 , this has indeed contributed towards increasing productivity of our work force . 
The Indian Institute of Technologies and the Indian Institute of Managements have created benchmark in technical and management education in the country and are held in high esteem internationally . 
It is , thus , heartening to note the number of IITs has increased from 7 in 2006 - 07 to 15 in 2011 - 12 , and the number of IIMs has increased from 6 to 13 over this period . 
The total number of degree awarding Institutions - Central , State and Private - has increased by 272 over the Eleventh Plan period . 
Evidently , the enrolment to higher education institutions in the country has also increased , from 1 . 39 crore in 2006 - 07 to 2 . 18 crore in 2011 - 12 , which is the terminal year of the Eleventh Five Year Plan . 
Notwithstanding our achievements , we have to upgrade the standard of higher education . 
The country lacks behind in terms of research and innovation . 
The total number of patent applications filed by Indians in 2010 was close to only six thousand , which pales in comparison to over 3 lakh applications filed by Chinese , around 1 . 7 lakh filed by German , 4 . 64 lakh filed by Japanese , and 4 . 2 lakh filed by Americans . 
The number of applications for patent filed by an Indian comprised only 0 . 30 % of the total applications filed in the world . 
To increase the reach of education in the country , flexible models such as Open and Distance Learning should receive more encouragement . 
Though the enrolment in such programmes has increased from around 27 lakh in 2006 - 07 to 42 lakh in 2011 - 12 but more needs to be done . 
Use of information technology and innovative methodology can usher in new vistas and provide increased coverage through opportunities that distance learning affords to those requiring flexible learning options . 
I am of the view that at the macro level , education nurtures nation building and at the micro level it fosters character building . 
I have a great faith in the philosophy and culture of our civilization . 
I also believe that the road to progress should be strengthened by harmonizing such values . 
I am , therefore , immensely encouraged by the education model that is practised by Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya . 
I once again congratulate all the students who have received degrees today . 
You are now facing a world of reality . Do not get disheartened . 
Skill , knowledge and confidence instilled in you by the University will stand you in good state . 
They are the best equipment and the whole world belongs to you . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Human Rights Day Function
I am happy to participate in the Human Rights Day function being organised by the National Human Rights Commission of India today . 
It gives me great pleasure to address this audience which has gathered to celebrate an occasion of universal importance and contemporary relevance . 
This day marks an important milestone in the quest of mankind towards realization of human rights for all citizens of the world . 
On this day , in 1948 , the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which proclaims that " All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights " . 
64 years have passed since then . The Declaration has provided guidance to many nations in ensuring their laws are in tandem with the fundamentals of human rights . 
In a world where human rights continues to remain a challenge in advanced as well as developing countries , the Declaration stands as a beacon for the international community on the standards it should set for the defence and promotion of human rights . 
The Universal Declaration is a reference document from which all subsequent human rights legal instruments have evolved to ensure protection of the weak and disadvantaged from injustice and arbitrary treatment . 
India ' s association with the international human rights movement runs deep . 
Dr . Hansa Mehta - a freedom fighter , educator and social reformer represented India on the United Nations Human Rights Commission which drafted the Declaration . 
She made significant contributions to the drafting of the Declaration , particularly on the subject of gender equality . 
Even before independence , India was active at the international level in its advocacy of the promotion and protection of human rights . 
The quest for realization of human rights and respect for human dignity was core to our independence Movement . 
The Indian independence Movement was also a major influence and catalyst for similar movements in other parts of the world . 
As early as 1895 , a great leader , Bal Gangadhar Tilak initiated the Swaraj Bill which contained the following rights , namely , the right to freedom of speech and expression , the right to equality , the right to vote and so on . 
After the publication of the Montague - Chelmsford Report , the Indian National Congress at its special session at Bombay demanded that the Government of India Act should contain a declaration of Rights of People embodying basic human rights . 
The Indian National Congress Session at Madras in 1927 passed a resolution that the future Constitution of India must have a declaration of Fundamental Rights . 
The Motilal Nehru Committee in 1928 and Tej Bahadur Sapru Committee in 1944 - 45 which drafted a Constitution for India laid emphasis on Fundamental Rights . 
The father of our nation , Mahatma Gandhi , was widely recognized as among the foremost human rights activists of the world at the time the Universal Declaration was being drafted . 
Mahatma Gandhi was therefore consulted on the elements that should go into the Universal Declaration . 
The essence of Gandhiji ' s political philosophy is the empowerment of every individual and protecting the dignity and self - respect of every human being . 
This is also the central message of the Universal Declaration . 
The Universal Declaration also recognizes that rights come along with duties , an idea strongly propounded by Mahatma Gandhi . 
While the Indian perspective found its due place in the Universal Declaration through the contributions of Dr Hansa Mehta , the Constitution of India too drew inspiration from the Declaration . 
While framing the Constitution of our country , the founding fathers used the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a first draft for formulating the provisions of Part III of the Constitution on Fundamental Rights . 
As a result , there are several identical features between the fundamental rights contained in our Constitution and the Articles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights . 
For instance - equality before law , non - discrimination on grounds of religion , race and sex , freedom of speech and expression , right to life and liberty and judicial remedy against violation of rights , are provided for in both these documents . 
India is a signatory to all important international conventions on human rights , such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and Conventions on Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination , Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women , Rights of the Child , Rights of Persons with Disabilities etc . 
Since independence , we have been unambiguous in our commitment to the preservation and protection of human rights globally as well as within the country . 
India accepts that certain rights have always been understood by man to be basic such as the right to life and liberty . 
If human rights are inseparable from man , they should be equal in their application to all human beings at all places and at all times . 
These rights are fundamental to the very existence of mankind and not merely for the benefit of one class or one section of the society . 
Our Constitution reflects this position . 
The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people within its territory and not just its citizens . 
Human rights is central to the very notion of peace and development . Former UN Secretary - General Mr . Kofi Annan once observed : 
" We will not enjoy security without development , we will not enjoy development without security , and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights " . 
Promotion of political rights alone will not lead to the full enjoyment of human rights . 
Economic , social and cultural rights are equally important . 
The two sets of rights - political and socio - economic are inter - dependent . 
The Universal Declaration echoes this thought by calling in its Preamble for the advent of a world in which freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people . 
On the eve of adopting the Constitution , Dr . B . R . Ambedkar , the Chief Architect of our Constitution observed , on 26th January 1950 , we are going to enter into a life of contradictions . 
In politics , we will have equality and in social and economic structure , continue to deny the principle of one man one value . 
How long shall we continue to live this life of contradictions ? 
How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life ? 
If we continue to deny it for long , we will do so only by putting our political democracy in peril . 
We must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment , else , those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of democracy which this Constituent Assembly has so laboriously built up . 
India ' s commitment to economic , social and cultural rights is reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy which forms Part IV of our Constitution . 
These principles have been described as fundamental in the governance of the country . 
They are guidelines to the Central and the State governments , to be kept in mind while framing laws and policies . 
In our approach to development , we have built on the Directive Principles and adopted a rights - based approach to areas such as education , employment and food security , which are basic endowments for dignified human existence
We have backed empowerment of our citizens with legal entitlements by enacting landmark legislation such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005 and the Right to Education Act of 2009 . 
Legislation to provide food security is also on the anvil . 
Good governance is the key to enforcement of rights by the people . 
The notions of transparency and accountability have to be translated into action . 
The Right to Information Act of 2005 entitles every citizen to the right to secure information under the control of public authorities . 
The National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ) , has since its inception in 1993 rendered yeoman service for the promotion and protection of human rights in the country . 
It has been playing a pivotal role in safeguarding the rights of the people . 
It has been involved in spreading human rights awareness and sensitization among various sections of society . 
The fact that people with impeccable credentials have occupied positions in this Commission has added to the credibility of this institution . 
It is due to this credibility enjoyed by the institution that the highest court of the country has been assigning matters of extreme importance to it . 
The Protection of Human Rights Act which established the NHRC is widely seen as a model legislation and has been since emulated by many countries of the world . 
The successful functioning of our Commission has also inspired similar bodies in many other countries . 
The Commission has over the years made significant contribution to the protection and advancement of the right to life , liberty and dignity of the individual , by virtue of its prestige and expertise . 
It has also contributed to the growth of a human rights movement in the country . 
The inevitable confluence of political and socio - economic rights in the cause of all round development of the country has been well understood by the NHRC . 
The work done by it in the field of eradication of child labour and bonded labour , creating and ensuring access to rights by children , women and people living on the margins of society , and public health , etc . is commendable . 
Human Rights Day is an occasion for us to reflect on the journey that we , as a nation , have travelled so far on the path outlined by the Constitution of India and what we need to do further to make human rights and dignified existence for all our people a reality . 
On this occasion of Human Rights day , I call upon our Government , the judiciary , statutory bodies like the National Commission and civil society to do their utmost for the promotion and protection of human rights . 
We must increase awareness for human rights by including it as a subject in school curricula . 
A human rights culture should infuse our national consciousness . 
Finally , we have an outstanding Constitution and a plethora of sound laws and policies to uphold different dimensions of human rights . 
However , such an elaborate legal infrastructure to manage human rights will count for nothing if implementation is lacking in form and spirit . 
We must therefore focus efforts on translating our laws and Constitutional provisions into a reality for the common man .

Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The National Conference on Ushering Second Green Revolution in Indian Agriculture Through Public - Private Partnership
Shri Tariq Anwar , Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Processing Industries , Shri Adi B . Godrej , President , Confederation of Indian Industry , Shri S . Gopalakrishnan , President Designate , CII and Executive Co - Chairman , Infosys , Shri Rakesh Bharti Mittal , Chairman , CII National Council on Agriculture and Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Bharti Enterprises , Shri Ajay Shriram , Vice - President CII and Shri Chandrajit Banerjee , Director General , CII , and Ladies and Gentlemen , 
I am happy to be here today to inaugurate the National Conference on ' Ushering Second Green Revolution in Indian Agriculture through Public - Private Partnership ' being organized by the Ministry of Agriculture in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industry . 
I am particularly delighted to share my thoughts with this august gathering of intellectuals , scientists , policy makers and industrialists on a subject that is of critical importance to a country like ours that has nearly one half of its work - force working in this sector . 
It is , therefore , imperative that we rivet greater attention to the issues that are bedeviling this sector because of its clear linkage to poverty that we have been struggling to eradicate . 
Despite the economic progress the country has made in the last six decades , we cannot ignore the majority of our rural population which depends on agriculture for their livelihood . 
Agriculture is the heart and soul of this nation . It is the most fundamental of activities that the human race depends upon for its existence . 
The association of people with agriculture and the importance they give to it from the times of the yore can be gauged by the fact that important festivals in different parts of our country have taken their roots from this occupation . 
In the course of our economic transition , the contribution of Agriculture to the nation ' s income has gradually declined . 
The Agricultural Sector contributed 23 . 4 % to the GDP during the Ninth Five Year Plan period . 
This declined to 19 % during the Tenth Five Year Plan period and to 15 . 2 % during the Eleventh Plan period . 
This is a testimony to the fact that growth rates in Agriculture and Allied Sectors have lagged behind the overall growth rate of the economy . 
The average growth rate in the Agriculture and Allied Sectors was 2 . 5 % , 2 . 4 % and 3 . 3 % during the Ninth , Tenth and Eleventh Plan periods respectively . 
In contrast , the average growth rate of the total economy in the corresponding time span was much higher at 5 . 7 % , 7 . 6 % and 7 . 9 % respectively . 
Close to 69 % of the total population of India resides in rural areas . 
According to the Planning Commission Survey , the poverty ratio amongst the rural populace is about 34 % as compared to the all - India poverty ratio of about 30 % . 
Thus , to alleviate poverty , promote inclusive growth , promote food security , increase employment opportunities and boost rural incomes , it is vital that Agriculture grows at a much faster pace . 
The growth rate of Agriculture and Allied Sectors during 2011 - 12 was 2 . 8 % , which was substantially lower than 7 % in the previous year but higher than the 0 . 4 % and 1 . 7 % growth rates in 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10 respectively . 
Though the growth rate of 2 . 1 % in this sector in the first half of this financial year is not very encouraging , I am hopeful that the second half will give us some cheer . 
The wide variation in agricultural growth is primarily on account of the vagaries of weather . 
Reliance on good weather for a successful crop has been the bane of Indian agriculture . 
But if we are to realize a much higher growth in this sector , then we must make a concerted and deliberate strategy to liberate this sector from the fetters of the nature to the extent possible like the advanced nations have done . 
The aim of the first Green Revolution in India to achieve self - sufficiency in food grains was realized in the sixties through a combination of the use of high - yielding varieties of seeds , increased use of fertilizers and strengthening irrigation . 
We have successfully achieved that goal of self - sufficiency . 
In 2011 - 12 , the total food grains production in the country was 257 million tonnes , which was above the target of 245 million tonnes set for the year . 
However , there are some lessons to be learnt from the first Green Revolution . 
The excessive use of chemical fertilizers became unsustainable in the long run as it gradually led to the decline in productivity . 
The use of high yielding seeds was confined to only food grains . Thus , the revolution touched only a limited percentage of India ' s total arable land . 
Dr . Norman Borlaug , the Nobel Peace laureate and the father of the Green Revolution , had stated in 1970 that " food is something that is taken for granted by most world leaders despite the fact that more than half of the population of the world is hungry " . 
Of course India , with its socio - economic compulsions , has never taken food security for granted . 
In fact , there is an increasing realization that high growth in Agriculture and Allied Sectors would be the catalyst for rural development in the country . 
I have to admit that there a number of focus areas which vie for our attention . 
But , we would have to give no less importance than any other area to increasing the productivity in agriculture . 
The agricultural growth in the Eleventh Plan period was also driven by improved agricultural prices . 
But this scenario has undergone a change in the Twelfth Plan period as demand for major crops is projected to decline . 
To meet the Twelfth Plan growth target of 4 % per annum , emphasis should be placed on improving productivity . 
Assigning priority to high yielding crops is a strategy that needs to be promoted with greater vigour . 
We must stress on improving seed replacement rate , use hybrid seeds that yield higher productivity , improve water management practices and promote balanced use of fertilizers and pesticides as well to achieve this goal . 
In India , farmland holdings are small . 
Those with less than 2 hectares comprise 83 % of all holdings and 41 % of area . 
This makes it imperative for us to adopt innovative schemes to increase productivity . 
In the context of advanced agricultural food supply systems in the world , it would be worthwhile to consider creating structures for greater farm - firm linkages . 
But more importantly , innovation through research and technology development for devising economically viable solutions to enhance productivity of small farms is the need of the hour . 
Farmers are at the cutting edge in the agricultural value chain . 
It is , therefore , necessary to ensure that they are adequately protected from the uncertainties of weather and market . 
To manage risk from the failure of crops due to natural calamities , pests and diseases , a National Agricultural Insurance Scheme was introduced in 1999 - 2000 to extend financial support to such distressed farmers . 
If prevention is a better measure to contain risk , then increased reliance on satellite communication for more accurate weather forecasts and better dissemination of such information would be crucial . 
It is also critical to control post - harvest wastages as this would improve access of farmers to markets to enable them obtain better prices for their products . 
The effective use of information technology to increase the reach of agriculture extension programmes would not only help to spread knowledge about agriculture , better practices and know how , it would also assist in building a valuable database of such knowledge in the country . 
As Finance Minister , I had outlined as part of the Union Budget for 2010 - 11 a four - pronged strategy for agriculture growth . 
It envisages the extension of the green revolution to the Eastern region of the country , to reduce the huge wastage on account of poor storage facilities , improving credit availability to the farmers and providing a further impetus to the development of the food processing sector . 
Progress in these areas is already visible . 
There has been significant increase in the production of paddy to the tune of 7 million tonnes in Kharif 2011 in the States of Eastern India . 
This achievement has been acknowledged internationally by organizations such as International Rice Research Institute . 
To create additional food grain storage capacity in the country , the Government has taken concrete steps . 
For instance , 2 million tonnes of storage capacity in the form of modern silos have already been approved for creation . 
Further , nearly 15 million tonnes of storage capacity is being created through private entrepreneurs and warehousing corporations . 
To enable affordable credit to farmers in a timely manner , the target for flow of agriculture credit has been enhanced in the successive Union Budgets , from Rs . 3 , 75 , 000 crore in 2010 - 11 to Rs . 5 , 75 , 000 crore in 2012 - 13 . 
To develop the food processing sector , farm proximate state - of - the - art infrastructure with strong backward and forward linkages are being created through the Mega Food Park scheme , introduced in the Eleventh Plan . 
Thus , some elements of the next generation revolution in the Agriculture sector are already taking place . 
But I would like to envision a Second Green Revolution in Agriculture that is more holistic and widespread . 
Such an initiative should be accompanied by development of rural infrastructure , human development and increased sensitivity to ecology and environment . 
Given the gargantuan task ahead , it is imperative that the Government should seek the right partnerships by building innovative structures that adequately encourage the involvement of the private sector in this area . 
I understand that the contribution of Agriculture to the country ' s GDP is declining and is lower than the Services and Industry sectors today . 
But I would exhort you to resist any temptation to be persuaded by some arguments to give only proportionate importance to this sector . 
Nothing could be more wrong . Giving agriculture the importance in proportion to its contribution to GDP may be as fallacious as attaching to the heart the importance in proportion to its weight in the human body . 
The linkage that the Agriculture sector has to almost all the facets of the society is indisputable . 
Its growth can spawn the much - needed social and economic transformation without which economic growth in other areas and that of the nation as a whole would lose its meaning . 
I am confident that pragmatic solutions to the problems that the agriculture sector is facing would emerge from this conference . 
I wish the conference great success and congratulate the organizers for taking the important initiative to hold this Conference . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of The National Seminar on ' Food Safety - Role of Standards ' 
It is indeed a privilege for me to be present here today at the National Seminar on ' Food Safety - Role of Standards ' . 
I congratulate the Bureau of Indian Standards for taking this initiative to create awareness about food safety and the role of standards in India . 
Clean , fresh and nutritious food is vital for the physical and mental health of our people . 
The safety of the food that we eat requires the maintenance of specific standards of hygiene during its preparation and processing . 
It also requires us to prescribe conditions for proper transportation and marketing of these items before they are consumed . 
Their storage is , similarly , required to be under safe conditions specified for the different products - which should also be communicated clearly to the consumers . 
These factors indicate that the establishment and enforcement of standards and guidelines are essential - both for manufacturers as well as for consumers . 
India has made significant strides over the past decades in food production as well as in exports of food products . 
India is among the 15 leading exporters of agricultural products in the world . It is noteworthy that in 2010 - 11 , exports of agricultural and allied products registered a robust growth rate of 39 . 3 per cent . 
It is indeed a positive development that manufacturers of food , transporters and all stakeholders in the chain of food supply in our country are becoming increasingly cognisant of the virtues of food safety . 
More and more of them are voluntarily and consciously adapting traditional approaches to develop innovative systems for food safety management . 
Globalization of the world economy has also given a significant boost to food trade - and resulted in a paradigm shift in food consumption patterns , production methods and processing technologies . 
But at the same time , there is a new risk - of faster trans - boundary transfer of microbiological and chemical hazards . 
This presents a new set of challenges to food safety . 
These potential risks require robust preventive and curative capacities to be put in place to safeguard the health of our population . 
The economic cost of poor safety standards can be high - in terms of treatment of food - borne diseases and the direct and indirect economic loss due to rejection or low grading of our products in the international market . 
For all these reasons , Food Safety has been a key priority for the Government of India . 
The Bureau of Indian Standards has an increasingly important role in this effort . 
I note that the Bureau of Indian Standards has formulated Indian Standards and a number of guidelines on best practices and management systems . 
In these , they have included Indian standards on Food Retail Management , Good Hygienic Practices , and Good Manufacturing Practices . 
The Indian Standard on basic requirements for street food vendors is an important step - especially in the context of the significant growth in the street food sector . 
It has important economic and nutritional implications for our urban populations as street foods are an accessible and affordable option for a sizeable percentage of our working population . 
We should also be conscious that a substantial majority of our food businesses are small and cottage scale units . 
They should not be intimidated by the standards that are set for them or find their implementation to be too complex . 
There must be a channel for addressing their genuine problems and generating practical solutions to these . 
They should be made aware that these standards are measures that have been taken by Government and regulators are in their own interest . 
By improving the safety of the food they produce and building food safety systems and capacity , they would increase their own profitability . 
The importance of consumer education in the prevention of food - borne illness is another universal imperative . 
When consumers are quality and safety conscious , they are able to complement the efforts of food control agencies in encouraging the food industry to provide good quality and safe food . 
I am happy to learn that the Bureau of Indian Standards , under the able guidance of Prof . K . V . Thomas , Hon ' ble Minister for Consumer Affairs , Food & Public Distribution , Govt . of India , has organized as many as four seminars for creating awareness about food safety . 
This outreach by the Bureau of Indian Standards will also be useful in gaining valuable feedback from consumers and key participants in the food supply industry all over our country . 
I have no doubt that this seminar will facilitate a purposeful exchange and sharing of information and experiences . 
It will contribute to enabling our country to be equipped with workable , practical and realistic systems for improving the safety of the food consumed in our country . 
I would like to convey to the participants in the National Seminar my best wishes . 
With these words , I , formally inaugurate this Seminar . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee during the ceremony for release of book ' My Tryst With Justice ' by Justice P . N . Bhagwat
I am extremely happy to be present on this occasion . 
We gather today not just to release a book but also to celebrate the life of a distinguished judge , humanist and legal luminary who has made profound contributions towards the building of a better India . 
Lives of some people are an inspiration for millions . 
They are lives which touch and lift to a higher sensibility all those who come in contact with them . 
Justice P . N . Bhagwati ' s life is one such life . And the book " My Tryst with Justice " is a humble expression of that life . 
Justice P . N . Bhagwati is much more than a great jurist , an extraordinary judge and an ambassador of human rights across the world . 
He is a humanist whose heart aches for marginalized and forgotten millions , a messenger for justice , and a revolutionary who transformed the words of the Constitution of India into weapons of the weak to fight against injustice . 
Justice Bhagwati is a judicial statesman and in a true sense , a judge of and for the people of India . 
Humanist by conviction , he along with Justice V . R . Krishna Iyer and Justice Y . V . Chandrachud was responsible for transformation of the Indian judiciary into a willing defender of the weak . 
Justice Bhagwati is living testimony of someone who believed that the true judicial role is to transcend the boundaries of technocratic adjudication . 
Justice Bhagwati is a pioneer of Public Interest Litigation ( PIL ) in India , promoter of the right to legal aid and emissary of Lok Adalats . 
He converted the courtroom into a site of people ' s struggle in humanizing law . 
Justice Bhagwati epitomizes how a judge can be instrumental in espousing the cause of justice to the millions of deprived Indians who are standing in the waiting room of history to become the subjects of justice . 
Justice Bhagwati spent a remarkably long tenure of 26 years in the higher echelons of judiciary - 13 years in the Gujarat High Court as Judge and later on as its Chief Justice , and 13 years in the Supreme Court as Judge and subsequently as Chief Justice of the country . 
His tenure was marked by continuous efforts to improve the justice delivery system and he spoke through numerous judgments and pronouncements , many of whom are landmark in nature . 
Justice Bhagwati ' s judgements contributed to making justice more accessible by the poor . 
Under his leadership , the common law principle of ' locus standi ' was expanded by the Supreme Court mandating that if a person or class of persons on whom a legal wrong or injury is caused , but is circumstanced by poverty , disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position to not approach the court , then a bona fide social action group or member of the public could maintain an action in the Supreme Court or in the High Court seeking judicial redress . 
In serving the same objective , the Supreme Court also devised the instrument of ' epistolary jurisdiction ' and allowed a mere letter or a post card instead of a petition on behalf of the disadvantaged , aggrieved class of persons , to knock the doors of the court for seeking justice . 
Some of his judicial pronouncements led to the release of countless numbers of bonded labourers from captivity , restoration of land to the dispossessed , and gave respect and meaning to the life of those who live in the margins of society . 
Justice Bhagwati also worked to create a legal aid infrastructure that gave meaning to Article 39A of the Constitution . 
He remained Chairman of the Legal Aid Organization while he was Chief Justice of India . 
His efforts in the direction of free legal assistance laid the foundation for the subsequent enactment of the Legal Services Authorities Act in 1987 , after his retirement . 
The juridical innovations that Justice Bhagwati undertook were a departure from orthodox Anglo - Saxon jurisprudence . 
However they reflected the true spirit of our Constitution and turned the Indian Judiciary into a powerful instrument of socio - economic justice for the underprivileged . 
This judicial creativity also became a pioneering innovation in global jurisprudence with lasting relevance to all developing countries with an independent judiciary . 
Family values play a vital role in the growth and development of an individual . 
Deep - seated humanitarian values , respect for all religions , conviction that every human being is a manifestation of God and the essential goodness of human beings were instilled in him by his parents early in his life . 
His wife , Ms . Prabhavati , who is present amongst , us today has been a source of constant encouragement to him . 
His siblings and children have also been a pillar of support providing emotional sustenance and motivation to him . 
. The role of family and values in moulding his personality is well described in the opening chapter of the book . 
Justice Bhagwati on his retirement 26 years ago chose to start a new innings as a champion of human rights in international fora . 
His vast experience , expertise and stature was put to use in the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations where he served for over sixteen years and in the International Labour Organization . 
Justice Bhagwati ' s reflections in his book reveal the life of an impressive and sensitive man . 
Justice Bhagwati is ten days short of 91 years . 
I wish him the very best of health and happiness in the remaining years . 
We must be thankful to Justice Bhagwati for having chosen to record his memories in the form of a book . 
I am certain this book titled , " My Tryst with Justice " , will be a guiding light and an inspiration for not just law students , legal practitioners and judges but also for common readers concerned about social justice in our country . 
This book will be a prized possession for every Indian who wants to make a difference to the world and who aspires for a world more just . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inaugural ceremony of The 27th Indian Engineering Congress
It is indeed a privilege for me to be present here on the occasion of the inaugural programme of the 27th Indian Engineering Congress organized by the Institution of Engineers ( India ) . 
The Institution of Engineers ( India ) was formed in 1920 in response to a felt need for an institution that would serve the cause of advancement of engineering and technology in India . 
In 1935 King George V accorded it the Royal Charter and since then engineers attached to this Institution are known as Chartered Engineers . 
Prior to the All India Council of Technical Education ( AICTE ) being given statutory powers in 1987 of regulating engineering and technical education in the country , the Institution of Engineers performed this task under the Royal Charter . 
The AMIE examination , equivalent to degree courses in engineering was also initiated by the Institute as early as 1928 for in - service technical professionals wanting to pursue further studies and acquire an engineering degree while continuing with their existing professions . 
During the next three days of this Congress there shall be substantive discussions on many facets of engineering based on the central theme " Engineering for Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth " . 
The scientific and technical community shall eagerly await the results of these deliberations and I am sure these shall go a long way in enabling movement towards Government ' s vision of fostering inclusive growth . 
As we all know , India is poised to be an economic power . 
In terms of purchasing power parity , the size of our economy is the largest in the world . 
The substantial growth rate that our country has achieved over the last few years is second only to China in the world . 
During the period 2003 - 04 to 2010 - 11 , we have had an annual growth rate in excess of 8 per cent on six occasions . 
Though the growth rate was subdued after 2010 - 11 under the pressures from the global economic meltdown , India ' s economy has been more resilient than most of the other emerging economy of the world . 
A growth rate of 9 per cent per year has been envisaged during the Twelfth Five Year Plan period of 2012 to 2017 . 
Such scales of economic expansion need several enabling factors prominent among them being education . 
We have , over time , created an infrastructure of good educational institutions for imparting quality education at all levels . 
In the higher education sector , India is endowed with 659 degree awarding institutions and 33 , 023 colleges . 
The number of Indian Institutes of Technology has increased from 7 in 2006 - 07 to 15 in 2011 - 12 . 
The enrolment to higher education institutions in the country has similarly increased , from 1 . 39 crores in 2006 - 07 to 2 . 18 crores in 2011 - 12 . 
Engineering comprised 13 per cent of the total enrolment in 2006 - 07 . 
The growth rate of enrolment in Engineering , which was close to 25 per cent annually during the Eleventh Plan period , is the highest for any field of study . 
Several steps have been taken to bring about an improvement in the quality of technical education , particularly engineering . 
Virtual labs developed for science and engineering are being rolled out . 
The Government , with the support of the World Bank , has been conducting a three - phase programme for technical education quality improvement . 
While the first phase from 2002 to 2009 covered 127 engineering institutions , the second phase from 2010 to 2014 would cover about 190 more engineering institutions . 
To achieve truly sustainable growth , however , poverty eradication is of utmost importance . 
Poverty and a degraded environment are closely inter - related , especially where people depend for their livelihoods primarily on the natural resource base of their immediate environment . 
Removal of poverty is , therefore , a prerequisite for the protection of the environment . 
Appropriate climate - responsive technologies are , accordingly , required to provide relief to the economically weaker sections of society . 
Several traditional practices that are sustainable and environment friendly continue to be a regular part of the lives of people in developing countries . 
These need to be encouraged rather than replaced by more modern but unsustainable practices and technologies . 
Technologies exist through which substantial reduction in consumption of resources is possible . 
Efforts to identify , evaluate , introduce and use these technologies must be made . 
The integration of agriculture with land and water management , and with ecosystem conservation , is essential for both environmental sustainability and agricultural production . 
An environmental perspective must guide the evaluation of all development projects recognizing the role of natural resources in local livelihoods . 
Mechanisms must simultaneously be put in place to make available to developing countries the latest technologies at reasonable cost . 
Technology transfer must be informed by an understanding of its implications in the social , economic and environmental contexts of the recipient societies . 
Where possible , existing local technologies must be upgraded and adapted to make them more efficient and useful . 
I hope that the Institution of Engineers ( India ) , which is the largest body of engineers and technologists in our country , will initiate steps to achieve these goals in consultation with all stakeholders . 
With these few words , I inaugurate the 27th Indian Engineering Congress and wish you the best in your deliberations . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of inauguration of National Energy Conservation Day - 2012
It gives me great pleasure to be here on the occasion of the presentation of the National Energy Conservation Awards 2012
These awards go a long way in spreading the message of energy conservation in society . 
There must be increased understanding of the fact that the path to a more sustainable future will require our society to make a better balance between its energy consumption vis - a - vis cost and availability . 
I congratulate the award winners from various industries for working together with the Government in its endeavour to promote sustainable development . 
I am equally pleased to see the participation by little children in the painting competition organised to spread the message of energy conservation through their simple and colourful paintings . 
I extend my heartiest congratulations to these children . 
Environmental concerns today occupy the centrestage of global discourse . 
Yet , our journey towards pursuing a truly sustainable path towards development has just begun . 
Energy consumption in India is expected to double over the next two decades , in line with the growth requirements of the economy . 
India occupies the fourth position in the world in energy consumption , after USA , China and Russia . 
But the country is not endowed with abundant energy resources required for sustaining such levels of consumption . 
Energy Intensity , which is a measure of the energy efficiency of a nation ' s economy and indicates the cost of converting energy into GDP , is higher for India than developed nations such as the UK , Germany , Japan and the USA . 
Thus , achieving a high GDP growth for the country while simultaneously meeting the energy needs of the population will pose a big challenge for us . 
The cumulative installed capacity of power as of March - end 2012 is close to 2 lakh MW , comprising renewable energy capacity of 24 , 503 MW . 
The capacity addition during the Eleventh Plan period was close to 55 , 000 MW , which is more than 2 . 5 times that of any of the earlier Plan periods . 
The domestic production of energy resources is projected to increase at an annual average rate of 6 . 84 % over the Twelfth Plan period . 
It is , however , unlikely that we can restrict our high dependence on imports . 
The net import of energy is , in fact , projected to increase by 8 per cent per year over the Twelfth Plan period . 
While the compulsions of achieving a high growth rate exist , such reliance on imports would have implications on the fiscal balance of our economy . 
Sustainable development mandates the use of available natural resources in a more efficient way . 
We have to , accordingly , promote universal access to energy , while , at the same time , promoting energy efficiency . 
A shift to cleaner energy sources is , thus , imperative . 
Climate change is a threat but also a unique opportunity to work together . 
As a developing country on the frontlines of climate vulnerability , India has a vital stake in the evolution of a successful , rule - based , equitable and multilateral response to climate change . 
A promising start has been made at the domestic level with the launch of the ' National Action Plan on Climate Change ' ( NAPCC ) . 
The Action Plan sets out a comprehensive response to climate change in the overall context of development , identifying measures that promote our development objectives while also yielding co - benefits for addressing climate change effectively
The eight missions under the Action Plan cover both adaptation and mitigation , in addition to scientific research . 
It is worthwhile to note that policies to promote energy efficiency , along with high energy prices and structural changes in the Indian economy have resulted in a sharp and declining energy intensity of the Indian economy
Today ' s children are the citizens and nation - builders of tomorrow . 
The National Painting Competition organized every year by the Ministry of Power has seen the involvement of school children in spreading the message of energy conservation in the country . 
The vibrant , yet simple , ideas presented by our children through their colourful paintings on this year ' s themes of " Bijli Bachao Unnati Lao " , " Do the Nation a Favour , be an Energy Saver " & " Wind , Water and Sun : Energy for the long run " reflect their clear understanding of the subject and what requires to be done to achieve environmentally sustainable growth . 
I congratulate these children for carrying forward the message of energy conservation in the country . 
With these words , I would once again like to compliment the efforts of the Ministry of Power in recognizing the efforts of the industry towards energy conservation . 
I also congratulate the awardees and hope that they would continue their efforts to promote energy conservation . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of Northern India Chief Minister ' s Conclave - " Refueling Growth " 
I am happy to be here today at the Northern India Chief Ministers ' Conclave being organized by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry
It gives me immense pleasure to share my thoughts with the political leaders who steer some of the largest States of the country and some of the Captains of the Indian industry to discuss an issue of immediate and great relevance to all of us . 
The PHD Chamber , in its history spanning more than a century , has endeavoured to build synergy between the Government and the Industry for the progress of our nation . 
I congratulate the Chamber for this initiative . 
India is , today , among the fastest growing countries in the world . 
The decadal average growth rate , which was 1 . 9 per cent in the Eighties , increased to 7 . 3 per cent in the last decade . 
India ' s share in World GDP has doubled in the last two decades , from 1 . 2 per cent in 1991 to 2 . 4 per cent in 2011 . 
It became the third largest economy in the world on Purchasing Power Parity basis this year . 
We have , therefore , a collective challenge to reverse this deceleration in growth and raise it to 8 to 9 per cent that we had recorded for most of the years in the previous decade . 
I need to hardly emphasize that growth is dependent on the investment rate and the efficient use of capital . 
The rapid economic growth after 2003 - 04 was accompanied by a rise in the investment rate . 
However , the investment rate has declined after reaching its peak in 2007 - 08 and for this , we have to create the conditions required for it . 
The manufacturing sector is an important tool for the creation of jobs in the country . 
Hence , growth of this sector is vital not only for the overall growth of the economy but also to meet the objectives of employment generation . 
The growth in the manufacturing sector , which was 9 . 7 per cent in 2009 - 10 and 7 . 6 per cent in 2010 - 11 , declined to 2 . 5 per cent in 2011 - 12 . 
The share of manufacturing in India ' s GDP of around 16 per cent , which has been the level since the eighties , is much lower than the comparable economies in Asia such as Thailand , South Korea , China and Malaysia , where its share is between 25 to 34 per cent . 
We have the advantage of a demographic dividend . 
The average age of population in India is below 30 years and over 60 per cent is in the working age group . 
This provides us with a unique advantage for driving future growth . 
But , it could also pose a serious challenge of creating 220 million jobs by 2025 . 
The National Manufacturing Policy that was announced a year ago has addressed this opportunity by aiming to increase the growth rate in manufacturing to 12 to 14 per cent over the medium term . 
In another decade , the share of manufacturing in the country ' s GDP is envisaged to rise to 25 per cent . 
To increase the competitiveness of this sector , a host of remedial measures are necessary . 
The World Bank annual surveys on ' Doing Business ' , which rank economies in 10 areas of business regulation , has placed India 132 out of the 185 economies surveyed in 2012 . 
While India ranks favourably in parameters such as Getting Credit and Protecting Investors , our country ' s rankings in areas such as Starting Business , Dealing with Construction Permits , Enforcing Contracts and Resolving Insolvency are not high . 
While the rankings may not truly reflect the ground realities , these are nonetheless indicative of the need for us to change . 
Thus , our emphasis should be on strengthening the weak areas so that the manufacturing sector can be benchmarked with the best in the world in terms of its competitiveness . 
Research and Development is the basic constituent of promoting innovation . 
The culture of research needs to be further augmented in our country . Only about 6 , 000 patent applications were filed by Indians in 2010 , which is a mere 0 . 30 per cent of the total applications filed in the world . 
India spends only 0 . 9 per cent of GDP on research and development whereas China spends about 1 . 2 per cent , UK 1 . 7 per cent and Israel 4 . 3 per cent . 
We should increase our expenditure in this area to become globally relevant in manufacturing . 
In countries such as Japan , the USA and South Korea , the private sector finances a majority of expenditure on industrial research and development . 
The share of the private sector in research and development in India is only one - fourth and there is an urgent need to increase it . 
To achieve the goal of improving research and development , we have to focus on creating centres of excellence in education . 
We do have a large number of engineering and technical institutions . But with the exception of a few , the others need strengthening . 
The Government , with support from the World Bank , has been conducting the ' technical education quality improvement programme ' , under which 127 engineering institutions were covered for quality improvement in its first phase from 2002 to 2009 . 
In the second phase from 2010 to 2014 , it has been envisaged to cover another 190 engineering institutions . 
I hope that in the next 10 to 15 years time , with all - round improvement in the parameters of competitiveness , the manufacturing sector of this country would contribute meaningfully towards economic growth and employment creation . 
Growth in the agriculture sector is important for alleviation of poverty , promotion of inclusive growth , sustenance of food security and generation of employment opportunities . 
The average growth rate in Agriculture and Allied Sectors during the Eleventh Plan period was 3 . 3 per cent , with 2 . 8 per cent growth in 2011 - 12 , which is the terminal year of the Plan . 
To accelerate the overall economic growth rate from the current levels , much higher growth in the Agriculture sector will be required , of say , 4 per cent annually , as envisaged for the Twelfth Plan period . 
Improvement in agricultural productivity would be important to accelerate growth in this sector . 
Measures to improve productivity such as diversification of high yielding crops , improvement in seed replacement rate , use of high yielding hybrid seeds , improvement in water management practices and promotion of balanced use of fertilizers and pesticides should be some of our areas of focus . 
We should also increase the technological base of our agricultural sector . 
As the Finance Minister , I had outlined a four - pronged strategy as part of the Union Budget for 2010 - 11 to push growth in the Agriculture sector . 
The four components of the strategy comprised of extending the green revolution to the Eastern region of the country , reducing the significant wastage in storage as well as in the operations of the existing food supply chains , improving credit availability to the farmers and give impetus to the food processing industry by providing state - of - the - art infrastructure . 
These strategies have led to positive outcomes in the sector and should help usher in a Second Green Revolution . 
The Service sector is the dominant sector of our economy , contributing close to 60 per cent of our GDP . 
Hence , any strategy for enhancing economic growth should focus on facilitating the growth of important services such as finance and banking , information technology and telecommunications . 
Though India has an important position in the global IT and IT enabled services , its prominence is being challenged by new emerging economies . 
We have to , therefore , improve the competitiveness of this sector . 
A well - developed financial system is an indicator of a mature economy . 
Our policies have enhanced the level of competition amongst different financial players , and in the process , has benefitted the common man . 
The financial sector in our country is one of the well - regulated sectors . 
The fact that the recent global financial crises has not affected us as it has some of the stronger economies , is a testimony to the maturity of our regulation . 
Yet , nevertheless to realize the full potential of this sector and achieve an accelerated growth and inclusion , further reforms are required in banking , pension and insurance . 
The high economic growth that we have envisaged for our nation will count for nothing unless we are able to translate this into tangible benefits of the poorer sections of our society . 
When 30 per cent of our population lives below the poverty line and 26 per cent are illiterate , ' inclusion ' cannot merely be a slogan but a compelling goal . 
India ' s economy is the sum total of its States ' economies . 
States with large economies are crucial for growth of the national economy . 
Maharashtra , Uttar Pradesh , Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat , the top five States in terms of economic size , contribute close to half the country ' s GDP . 
Though only one State in this list is from the Northern region of the country , the share of the Northern States in the country ' s GDP is around 21 . 4 per cent . 
Growth in the Northern States of the country is , therefore , significant for the nation ' s growth and therefore , it is a challenge that the Chief Ministers gathered here , should accept . 
Of the five economically biggest states , only Maharashtra and Gujarat grew by more than 8 per cent in 2011 - 12 . 
But , there is a perceptible deceleration in these states , from the high levels of growth achieved by them in the previous two years . 
Amongst the states in Northern India , Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have grown at a rate less than the average growth of the country in 2011 - 12 . 
This needs to change . 
I am happy to note that amongst the states with larger economies , Delhi , Madhya Pradesh , Bihar and Chhattisgarh , have registered growth of above 10 per cent in 2011 - 12 . 
This is no mean achievement considering the slowdown in the global and national economy . 
I am hopeful that these states will continue to grow at this pace , if not faster , and other states in the country will follow suit . 
It is indeed important for this conclave to have brought many state leaders on a common platform to deliberate about the contribution that states can make to further India ' s journey of progress . 
I wish all the participants of this conclave the very best for a fruitful and meaningful interaction which would find ways to accelerate economic growth in the states and the nation as a consequence . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of presidential standard to 25 squadron and 33 squadron of The Indian Air Force
Shri K . Rosaiah , Governor of Tamil Nadu , Air Chief Marshal N . A . K . Browne , Chief of the Air Staff , air warriors of the Indian Air Force , and distinguished guests . 
It gives me immense pleasure to be here today at Sulur , to award Standards to 25 Squadron and 33 Squadron of the Indian Air Force . 
Both these flying units have a rich tradition of valour and courage and have rendered distinguished service to the nation since their inception . 
Their personnel , both past and present , have set the highest standards in pursuit of excellence that others would do well to emulate . 
For their selfless devotion , professionalism and courage in the face of adversity , the nation honours them today . 
The Indian Air Force has won many laurels in the defence of our nation . 
Beginning its existence over 80 years ago in the pre - independence era , the Indian Air Force has today grown into one of the most powerful and professional forces in the world , capable of facing any threat to our national integrity . 
The operational capability of the Indian Air Force constitutes an important cutting edge of the nation ' s military strength . 
Since we gained independence , the Indian Air Force , besides safeguarding the sovereignty of our nation , has always been available to provide humanitarian assistance during disasters both within and outside the nation . 
I do remember that , the Air Force had flown relief supply in 2005 to a place as far as the US when Katrina had struck New Orleans . 
In 2008 , the Indian Air Force flew relief supplies to earthquake hit South - western province of Sichuan in China . 
India stands for peace and its foreign policy is focused on the achievement of this objective
Therefore , effective deterrence is the cornerstone of our defence policy . 
But effective deterrence requires the maintenance of a force that can be called upon at any time , to secure the sovereignty of our nation . 
Our armed force , of which the men and women who stand before us , symbolizes , this capability . 
The courage and determination of our air warriors is a matter of pride for the nation . 
They have earned it by their performance during multi - national exercises within India and abroad . 
The Air Force of some of the most advanced nations have also marveled at the technical and tactical capability of our men and women . 
This has been achieved through a disciplined and strenuous training regime . 
Our air warriors have also been selected to be a part of U . N . peacekeeping missions . 
This is a testimony to your capabilities , discipline and excellence . 
The 25 Squadron , " The Himalayan Eagles " , has been the lifeline of the armed forces , personnel and citizens in the Northern Frontiers for over five decades , in times of peace as well as war . 
It has been a pillar of support in providing security and succor , besides playing a critical role in development of J & K and the entire northern region . 
During the 1965 and 1971 wars and Kargil Operations , the aircraft of the 25 Squadron had even in the face of heavy odds , airlifted critical supplies for the troops and performed some very important operations . 
The Squadron has provided swift relief to fellow citizens in almost all natural calamities including Bhuj earthquake and Tsunami relief . 
The performance of the 25 Squadron in national and international exercises is a result of high standards of professionalism attained by the squadron personnel . 
The unit has , thus , been truly living up to its motto of " SATVADHINA HI SIDDHAYA " or " EXCELLENCE THROUGH DILIGENCE " . 
The 33 Squadron is a premier Transport squadron of the Indian Air Force . 
The Squadron participated in both 1965 and 1971 wars . 
The Squadron played a major role in the Indian Peace Keeping Force operations in Sri Lanka in 1989 . 
After tsunami struck our island territories , the personnel of 33 Squadron flew extensive relief operations , bringing much needed respite to the local populace . 
The Squadron has also been maintaining an effective air bridge to our island territories . 
The Squadron has always lived up to it motto " SHRAMO DADATI SIDDHIM " which translates to " HARD WORK LEADS TO ACHIEVEMENT " . 
I am confident that the squadron will continue to attain greater heights of glory in the years to come . 
It was extremely heartening to see the high standards of parade displayed by the air warriors of both the squadrons . 
My compliments to all of you . 
In acknowledgement and recognition of their outstanding performance over the years , I award the President ' s Standard to 25 Squadron and 33 Squadron . 
I take this opportunity to acknowledge and compliment the personnel and families of both these squadrons , both past and present , for their continued sacrifice and service to the nation . 
The nation is indeed proud of you . I wish you all the best for a glorious future . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Felicitation Function at Suri Vidyasagar College
It is indeed a moment of joy and nostalgia to be back at the college where I spent four of the best years of my youth . 
It seems like yesterday that I was admitted for the I . Sc course in 1952 . 
My registration no . was 5057 . 
The registration fee at that time was Rs . 2 / - . 
I went on to do the B . A course from 1953 - 56 and I distinctly remember collecting my graduation mark sheet on the 13th of August , 1956 from this college . 
I resided at " Chhatrabas " situated North of the Nilakshi . 
There were at that time eight boys ' hostels in the college . 
My batchmates included Gopal Sarkar , Shri Sasthi Kinkar Das , Prof . Amal Mukhopadhyay , Prof . Dwipendu Banerjee , Shri Balaram De , Shri Ganga Charan Mishra , Shri Rajat Kumar Mishra , Shri Angshu Bhusan Bhattacharyya , Sri Sambhu Gopal Das , Sri Jatadhari Malakar and Shri Bimalendu Naskar . 
I recall them and their families vividly . 
I am very happy to see some of them here today . 
It is with great respect and reverence that I remember the Principal , Professor Arun Sen . 
It was a privilege to have studied under the guidance of the venerated teachers who guided my efforts as an earnest young student here - more than half a century ago . 
The goals and motto of the Suri Vidyasagar College , " Jnana " , " Tyaga " , and " Seva " , that is , wisdom , self - sacrifice and social service , embedded in the college emblem , inspired my thoughts and actions . 
They remained in my heart all these years . 
It has since been an eventful journey for me , full of challenges but I have been fortunate as there have also been so many rewards along the way . 
This is an important moment in the evolution of the higher education framework in our country . 
We have reason to be optimistic . At the end of financial year 2011 - 12 , the overall figures revealed a total of 659 degree awarding institutions and 33 , 023 colleges . 
. This indicates that enrolment to higher education institutions in the country has increased , from 1 . 39 crore in 2006 - 07 to 2 . 18 crore in 2011 - 12 . 
However , the challenge remains - to maintain and upgrade the standard of education imparted in these institutions . 
The other urgent need is to train and motivate their teaching staff . 
Universities need to develop in their students a scientific temper and a curriculum that will encourage the growth of research and innovation . 
To provide greater access to quality higher education to more students , the financial assistance offered must increasingly offer a mix of scholarships , education loans and self - help plans such as ' earn while you learn ' schemes . Increasing the reach of education in the country , flexible models such as ' open ' , and ' distance ' learning are far - reaching initiatives and should be encouraged and supported . 
I am told that the response to such initiatives has increased - from around 27 lakh in 2006 - 07 to 42 lakh in 2011 - 12 . This is a positive development . 
While information technology has been put effectively at the disposal of distance learning programmes , more innovative use of technology needs to be made so that besides increasing its coverage , modules can be devised that are more user - friendly . 
Research is a key requirement where there is a potential and a need for a concerted drive . 
Last year , for an estimated 260 lakh students at the under - graduate level and above , there were only one lakh PhD students . 
This needs to be given a boost . 
A study of the incentive structure for a research student would indicate how he or she can be incentivized to move towards research . 
We must take full advantage of India ' s fortunate demographic ratio ; our economy ' s sustained economic growth would depend on appropriate human capital formation . 
And this should be our priority . 
Government of India ' s 12th Plan Strategy includes a series of initiatives . 
These include the establishment of more Central Universities , greater emphasis on technical education and distance learning , academic reforms , interest subsidy on education loans , establishment of innovation universities , expansion of existing institutions and a focus on better quality - in research , infrastructure , faculty and curriculum content . 
The strategy gives due emphasis to greater outreach and more opportunities for all the sections of our society . 
Governance reforms and restructuring will also be a timely measure . 
All these initiatives are welcome and outcome oriented . We should support Government ' s efforts through private partnerships as much as we can and wherever these are possible and feasible . 
To the students here , I would emphasise that the time is not far when they will reap the full benefit of all these steps - and more - that Government of India is taking in the interest of their generation . 
With these few words , I have the pleasure to offer you all my felicitations and good wishes and greetings of the season . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of inauguration of centenary celebrations of The Award of Nobel Prize to Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore
I am extremely happy to inaugurate the centenary celebrations of the award of Nobel Prize to Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore which is beginning with this international seminar " Vibrations between Tagore and the World : 
Culture and Literature with special reference to China " being organized jointly by Visva - Bharati , Santiniketan and the Institute of Chinese Studies , Delhi . 
As we stand on the threshold of the centenary of Asia ' s first Nobel Prize to Gurudev in 1913 , we remember with reverence his idea of the vibration between the self and the world , especially with reference to his special regard for China . 
The Nobel citation noted Rabindranath ' s " profoundly sensitive , fresh and beautiful verse , by which with consummate skill , he has made his poetic thought , expressed in his own English words , a part of the literature of the west
" The ' spellbound contemplation of divinity and his love of all life ' that the Nobel Committee Report had noted was complemented by " the descriptions of the life of common people of his own country " as it touched " the ever increasing harmony of the soul with the life of nature itself " . 
The idea of civilizational meeting of the world through knowledge of each others cultures and literature was an idea that had fascinated Tagore . 
At Visva - Bharati , he had asserted that in whatever is the best of civilization , every single individual can state his right . 
The ideal of Visva - Bharati ' Yatra Visvam Bhavati eka needam ' - where the world makes its home in a single nest " was the visualization of a multicultural cosmopolitan space of equality , exchange and harmony across borders of caste , creed or nation . 
The ' unwavering faith in global man ' was what the Nobel Prize had recognized . 
Tagore had realized the special role of Asia in the pattern of vibrations between the self and the world . 
Consequently when he had received the invitation by the Peking Lecture Association he wrote , " When the invitation from China reached me , I felt it was an invitation to India herself and as her humble son , I must accept . " 
He later added that " a poet ' s mission is to attract the voice which is yet inaudible in the air ; to inspire faith in the dream which is unfulfilled �
I ask your help in joining hands in opening this path of friendship between China and our neighbors all over Asia " . 
It is with this mission that he wrote on March 20 , 1924 prior to his departure to China , " I am hoping that our visit will re - establish the cultural and spiritual connection between China and India " 
What did Tagore seek within China ? 
He had noted from 1881 onwards the oppression suffered under imperial rule by both nations . 
But he had also carefully noted the movements of the ideas of spirituality , non - violence and tolerance across the borders especially through the message of Buddhism . It was this historical bond that he sought to revitalize . 
Interestingly Tagore ' s winning the Nobel Prize was also a moment of reassertion of an Asian dignity within China . 
As early as 1915 his poems and stories had been translated into Chinese . 
The tumultuous reception that he received from poets and intellectuals in 1924 served as testimony to the appeal of his ideas among the Chinese literati . 
The title accorded to him Zhu Zhen Dan - " the Indian Sun " put him in the ranks of the ancient Indian monks who had initiated the seamless movement of ideas across borders . 
The keynote of Tagore ' s Talks in China in 1924 emphasized the necessity of the two Asian neighbours to strengthen bonds across culture and together strive for the welfare of its citizens rather than look for material greed or power . 
Tagore ' s attempt to build bridges was however not a mere utopian dream . 
At Visva - Bharati , where he had initiated the study of world cultures , he started the programme for Chinese studies in 1921 , with the help of Sylvan Levi , Vidusekhara Sastri and Lin Wo Jiang . 
The turning point arrived when Tagore met Tan Yun Shan in 1927 at Singapore . 
Tan Yun Shan ' s visit to Santiniketan in 1928 saw the founding of the Sino Indian Societies in China and India leading to the inauguration of Cheena Bhavana in April 1937 . 
The vibrations that Tagore had dreamt of had attained reality with the able help of Tan Yun Shan . 
Over a period of time the Cheena Bhavana in particular has housed rare books , bridged cultures and been a first in the people to people relationship with China that is so vital for global harmony . 
In 1957 , the Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai was conferred the Deshikottama by Visva - Bharati creating a new chapter in Sino Indian relations . 
We often see nations as monoliths with rigid boundaries . 
But visionaries like Tagore have made us realize that literature , histories and cultures represent common ideals of humanity that transcend national limits . 
It is this sense of a shared humanity , a Visva - Bodh that Tagore sang of in his literature and music and attempted to realize at Visva - Bharati . 
It is thus fitting that the celebration of Asia ' s first Nobel prize should be initiated at Visva - Bharati and be an occasion , not only to reiterate our historical bonds , but the need for cooperation and close exchange of ideas in the future . 
India and China stand on the threshold of a leap into an exciting phase of global exchange , where harnessing of ideas and resources for global welfare can serve as a major fulcrum for world peace and welfare . 
This seminar thus will not merely celebrate the award of a Nobel Prize to an individual ; it will celebrate the potential of the idea of exchange , co - operation and multiculturalism . 
I congratulate Visva Bharati for the true spirit of universal cooperation and inclusion that it has displayed while celebrating Gurudev ' s 150th Birth Anniversary . 
Under the guidance of the National Committee headed by the Prime Minister and the National Implementation Committee , that I had the honour to head as the then Finance Minister ; Visva - Bharati has worked in perfect collaboration with governmental agencies , so as to bring out Tagore ' s vision , achievements and works before the entire world . 
Let us use this occasion to remember the abiding idea of his life : 
I feel what we suffer from in the present day is this calamity of obscurity , of seclusion , that we have missed our opportunity of offering hospitality to humanity and asking the world to share the best things we have got �
The spirit of India has always proclaimed the ideal of unity . 
This ideal of unity never rejects anything , any race , or any culture . 
On 26 May , 1921 , in an impromptu speech delivered in Stockholm , Rabindranath Tagore had asked the question , " What the reason could be of my poems being accepted and honoured so much ? " 
In the same speech , Rabindranath suggested that , " my countrymen would share with me , the honour which had been awarded " . 
Clearly , for the poet it was not merely a personal recognition - in colonial India it was an assertion of a new Indian identity , that could synthesize the traditional and the modern in the global space . 
At the same time , it was a recognition that in his texts , the reflection of the deepest truths and cadences of Indian philosophy and literature could restart itself in the world . 
It is Tagore ' s perfect sense of synergy and joy - the joy of submission to a divine power , the joy of surrendering the self , of participating in the vast expanse of nature and realizing the nooks and corners of humanity that made him relevant in 1913 , and continues to make him relevant today . 
Tagore received the Nobel award with nonchalance and humility because it was testament to his ideas of global harmony , exchange of cultures and an assertion of the joy and dignity of life . 
A hundred years have passed . 
This centenary celebration will pay homage to the beauty of that idea of collapsing boundaries , human love and selfless service . 
Let India and Visva - Bharati pay its tribute by actualizing Tagore ' s own verses : 
" Where the mind is without fear , where the Head is held high , where knowledge is free ; Where the world has not broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls " 
Let that dream be ours as we enter this centenary celebration . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the banquet in honour of The Heads of State / Government WHO Attended The Asean - India Special Commemorative Summit
I am extremely happy to welcome you all on this occasion to celebrate the ASEAN - India Commemorative Summit . 
This year the ASEAN - India Dialogue Partnership has reached a significant milestone . 
In two decades of steady development , the ASEAN - India Dialogue Partnership has matured into a Strategic Partnership . 
This , to my mind , is a natural coming of age . 
This is an auspicious occasion indeed as we embark into a new phase in our relationship - in which we will create an even more comprehensive partnership for peace and prosperity between our nations . 
We , in India , perceive our partnership with ASEAN as a pact for growth and economic progress . 
We all have a shared vision of promoting peace and stability and we are united in our dream of a new Asia full of promise and opportunities . 
There will be challenges but we are confident of our ability to co - operate and address these collectively and successfully in the interest of our peoples . 
The essence of the ASEAN and India partnership is that it facilitates and assists each partner country in strengthening its national programmes for sustainable economic and socio - cultural development and in contributing to the growing relevance of Asia globally . 
The Asia - Pacific region is today central to the global dialogue on political , economic and security issues . 
It is , therefore , natural that ASEAN and India , with their affinities and complementary capacities , come together for the definition of the new economic and security architecture in the region . 
We have joined the ASEAN in building strong foundations for this - as a Sectoral Partner of ASEAN in 1992 , a full Dialogue Partner in 1996 and a Summit level partner in 2002 . 
In the last decade , as our respective capacities have grown , our partnership has become all the more relevant . 
We have now succeeded in putting in place the structural framework for a comprehensive intensification of our co - operation ; and we have developed several far - reaching and well conceived projects and programmes in our collective interest . 
India has been consistent in its support to the evolution of ASEAN ' s central and leading role in this region . 
We endorse your objectives for an ASEAN Community by 2015 , for a Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity , the Initiative for ASEAN Integration and , most recently , the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership . 
I am happy to note the significant increase in the people - to - people programmes between ASEAN and India over the last year . 
The ASEAN and Indian participants in the Car Rally are witness to the strong ties of affection that bind us . 
This was evident in the spontaneous warmth and hospitality that they received in the 8 ASEAN countries and India that they traversed during their 22 day journey . 
Our 11 countries participated in this commemorative event with enthusiasm and a sense of great anticipation . 
Geographic connectivity between ASEAN and India is a strategic asset . 
We are neighbours with long - standing maritime links . 
We have a bridge between us - of ideas , intellect , trade , and learning over the centuries . 
We are now adding a " digital " dimension to this connectivity . 
The ASEAN India Car Rally and the sail training ship INS Sudarshini ' s expedition to ASEAN countries have not only brought goodwill and awareness along the route that they took but they also brought together multitudes of people in virtual connectivity . 
These were people who were following the events real time and , speaking to each other through their growing network of electronic mail , through blogs and twitter . 
I note that our increasing co - operation in the key sectors of tourism , agriculture , environment , renewable energy , information technology and space allows us to develop innovative approaches to anticipate and address future challenges . 
Our focus on building capacities and synergies , of improving our mutual connectivity and encouraging economic trade and investment among ourselves is equally important for the development of our human resources , and for bringing stability and prosperity to our people . 
Our trade has surpassed our expectations . We are now looking at ways and means to enhance co - operation between our Small and Medium Enterprises and entrepreneurial sectors . 
We should take full advantage of our complementarities through more ambitious agreements ; we should catalyse the flows of investments and goods and services , and link the synergies of our youth ; we should facilitate the joint initiatives of the industrial sectors in our respective countries and we should improve the infrastructural capacity in our region to meet the aspirations and ambitions of our peoples . 
Your deliberations earlier today at the Plenary of the Commemorative Summit have set the agenda and showed the way for our collective efforts in the days to come . 
The Vision Statement emanating from this Summit takes into account some excellent recommendations by the ASEAN - India Eminent Person Group aimed at realizing the full potential of our partnership . 
It is now for our Governments to formulate specific proposals to pursue the recommendations that they collectively agree to pursue . 
India ' s engagement with the ASEAN has grown in a manner that is commensurate with the increase in our collective capacities , our growing economic integration and the evolving politico - security context in the Asia - Pacific . 
We have established a robust framework for co - operation under the Plan of Action to Implement the ASEAN - India Partnership for Peace , Progress and Shared Prosperity ( 2010 - 15 ) . 
The ASEAN countries are central to India ' s Look East Policy . 
ASEAN continues to be our natural partner in the Asia Pacific region . 
I would also like to emphasize that our future priorities must attach special importance to our ongoing co - operation in the knowledge and skills sector and make it easier for our professionals , entrepreneurs , students and tourists to travel between our countries . 
Our growing engagement in areas such as maritime security and counter - terrorism is important to meet these common challenges . Given our cultural affinity , an example of which we witnessed here today , physical proximity , and shared priorities , the ASEAN - India relationship is showing increasing evidence of becoming more comprehensive and strategic in nature . 
As we have articulated in the vision statement , a closer integration between ASEAN and India will be to the mutual benefit of the nations that we represent this historic evening . 
With these words , Excellencies , I invite you to join me in raising a toast to the strong future of the ASEAN - India Strategic Partnership , to the progress and prosperity of all our peoples and to our lasting friendship . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the 9th annual convocation of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology
I am happy to be here in this historic city of Allahabad to deliver this Convocation Address . 
Situated as it is at the confluence of three rivers , Ganga , Yamuna and the mythological Saraswati , Allahabad has traditionally been the seat of spirituality , knowledge and learning . 
It was also the epicentre of India ' s movement for independence and citizens of this city formed the vanguard of our freedom struggle . 
The foundation stone of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology ( MNNIT ) , then a Regional Engineering College was laid on 3rd May , 1961 by Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru while Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri formally inaugurated the College building on 18th April , 1965 . 
The institution they helped to create and nurture has today grown into one of India ' s finest in the field of technical education . 
The Government of India , recognising MNNIT ' s efforts , has accorded it the status of an Institution of National Importance . 
It is heartening to note that all 14 Departments of the Institute are today offering Ph . D . programmes . 
I would like to congratulate all the bright young minds who are passing through its hallowed portals and hope that over time they shall leave an indelible mark on the country ' s progress . 
Our country is fast becoming a major economic power . 
In terms of Purchasing Power Parity ( PPP ) , we are the third largest economy in the world . \
The growth rate that our country enjoys is second only to China among the major economies in the world . 
In six out of the last nine years , we managed a growth rate in excess of 8 % . 
Though the growth rate had slightly contracted since 2010 - 11 in the face of global economic meltdown , India has been able to withstand the crisis and has shown a remarkable resilience . 
One of the key factors behind India ' s economic resilience is the strong foundation it has established since independence and in the early implementation of our plans in the field of higher education . 
It is through education that we build intellectual capital and create a skilled workforce which can contribute directly to the nation ' s output . 
Research is an advanced product of education . 
Research leads to innovation , technological advancement and process perfection , which in turn shifts production frontiers and creates capacity for future growth . 
This is an important moment in the evolution of the higher education framework in our country . 
We have reason to be optimistic . At the end of financial year 2011 - 12 , the overall figures revealed a total of 659 degree awarding institutions and 33 , 023 colleges . 
Enrolment to higher education institutions in the country increased from 1 . 39 crore in 2006 - 07 to 2 . 18 crore in 2011 - 12 . 
The Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education is targeted to increase from nearly 18 % at present to about 25 % by 2016 - 17 . 
However , despite these achievements , it is widely recognized that our country ' s education system is burdened with demands of both quantity and quality . 
We need many more universities and technical institutions to be able to address the higher education needs of our increasing number of students . 
What we need most is to provide good quality education . 
I want to share with you my sense of disappointment on seeing , in recent reports , that not a single Indian University or Institute of higher learning figure in the list of top 200 Universities in the world . 
Whether the Survey reflects the true position of our Universities and Institutes is beside the point . 
Befitting our growing economic power status , we must raise the standards of our higher education to a level that we reach undisputedly among the top ten or at least top fifty in the world in the coming years . 
In a globalised world , Indian institutions should aim not only at becoming top universities in India but also establish themselves as world class universities with international standards of research , teaching and learning . 
. To maintain high standards , institutions must constantly upgrade themselves . 
They must not only invest in infrastructure and use the latest technology in the imparting of education , but also engage outstanding faculty and update their courses and curriculum constantly with changing times and requirements . 
There is urgent need to develop a curriculum that will encourage the growth of research and innovation . 
To provide greater access to quality higher education to larger number of students , the financial assistance offered must increasingly include a mix of scholarships , education loans and self - help plans such as ' earn while you learn ' schemes . 
Flexible models such as ' open ' , and ' distance ' learning also needs to be encouraged and supported . 
Research is a key area where there is tremendous potential and need for a concerted drive . 
Last year , for an estimated 260 lakh students at the under - graduate level and above , there were only one lakh PhD students in our country . 
We lag far behind many other countries in research and innovation . 
The total number of patent applications filed by Indians in 2010 was only around six thousand , which pales in comparison to over 3 lakh applications filed by Chinese , around 1 . 7 lakh filed by Germans , 4 . 64 lakh filed by Japanese , and 4 . 2 lakh filed by Americans . 
he number of applications for patents filed by Indians comprised only 0 . 3 % of the total applications filed in the world . 
The Government of India ' s 12th Plan Strategy includes a series of initiatives in the field of higher education . 
These include the establishment of more Central Universities , greater emphasis on technical education and distance learning , academic reforms , interest subsidy on education loans , establishment of innovation universities , expansion of existing institutions and a focus on better quality in research , infrastructure , faculty and curriculum content . 
The strategy gives due emphasis to greater outreach and more opportunities for all sections of our society . Governance reforms and restructuring has also been priority . 
Progress of a country cannot be guaranteed unless all sections of society take part in nation building to their full potential . 
Women must be accepted and seen as equal or more than equal partners in our progress and prosperity as a nation . 
The participation of women in higher education is , in general , lower than men , and in engineering , the situation is even more acute . 
I am told that in MNNIT , the percentage of female students in the last ten years was around 8 % . 
This is woefully short of what we should envisage as a nation of equal opportunity . 
I am hopeful that engineering as a discipline and a career of choice will attract many more girl students in the future . 
I take a moment here to express my deep distress over the recent incident of brutal violence against a young girl in Delhi . 
The Government is alert to the situation and is taking necessary action to ensure that such unfortunate incidents are not repeated in future . 
I pray for the speedy recovery of this brave young girl . Criminal attacks against women often happen in backdrop of negative perceptions about women harboured and propagated by certain elements in society . 
This must change . 
We must inculcate in every member of our society the highest of respect for women and the youth of the country , particularly students of prestigious institutions like MNNIT must take the lead in this regard . 
I appreciate the justified anger of the youth over this ghastly incident but at the same time I humbly remind them that reason should not be thrown to the winds . 
Youth must learn to control emotions . Violence is not the solution . 
I am told that one of the security persons on duty passed away today . 
I express condolences over the sad demise of this man who passed away in the call of duty . 
I share the agony of his family . 
I hope this will not be repeated in future . 
Throughout the history of mankind , engineering and technology have proved to be the strongest driving forces in the cause of human development and culture . 
In addition to the duty towards the academic and technical community , graduating students have a larger social responsibility that they should strive to fulfill . 
I am confident that graduates of MNNIT will contribute in abundant measure , to the task of nation building . 
I would like to congratulate the degree recipients once again and wish them all success in life and their careers . 
I call upon the graduates to uphold the dignity of their education and carry out their responsibilities towards society and the nation . 
The route to success may be a rocky one , but the person who completes the route has actually finished a pilgrimage - his roots are firm , and his foundations are strong . 
Keep the flame of innovation alive ; never be lulled into complacency and never be lured by short - cuts . 
I end by quoting two lines from Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ' s poem : 
" The traveller has to knock at every alien door to come to his own , and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end " 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of special convocation in The Banaras Hindu University
I am delighted to be present here in this famous seat of learning founded by the great patriot , Mahamana Pt . Madan Mohan Malaviya Ji on the occasion of the closing ceremony of the year long celebrations of his 150th birth anniversary . 
It is a happy moment for all of us that we are commemorating this event by conferring the highest degree of the University on the Hon ' ble President of Nepal , a country with which India has deep cultural affinity and historical ties . 
In fact , Kashi or Varanasi - has age old linkages with the people of Nepal . 
The Banaras Hindu University since its inception has carried forward this tradition with students from Nepal almost always on its rolls . 
Among its alumni are scores of leaders , ministers , parliamentarians , judges , academicians , public figures and citizens from Nepal . 
It is indeed most befitting that we are honouring the First Citizen of this great country and close neighbour of ours . 
It is also a matter of great pleasure that the University has established two very important interdisciplinary centres - namely Malaviya Centre for Human Values and Ethics and Inter - Cultural Studies Centre - to promote the vision and ideas of the Mahamana . 
These are endeavours to keep the noble mission of the Mahamana alive . 
I am therefore pleased to lay the foundation stone today for the building of these two centres proposed to be located in the Malaviya Heritage Complex . 
A true son of the soil , Malaviyaji dedicated his whole life in the service of the nation . 
A statesman , scholar , educationist , journalist , social reformer and legislator , his contribution to the making of Modern India has been immense and varied . 
He was one of the foremost architects of Modern India and also one of the important leaders of the Indian National Movement . 
I recall the glowing words with which Pt . Jawaharlal Nehru paid tribute to Malaviyaji : 
" A giant among men , one of those who laid the foundation of modern Indian nationalism and , year by year , built up , brick by brick and stone by stone , the noble edifice of Indian freedom . " 
An intellectual and practical champion of global peace and intercultural harmony , Mahamana sought to draw the best from the eastern learning and western scientific knowledge . 
He strived to create a holistic template of education and actualize the same through the Banaras Hindu University which he established in the year 1916 . 
Banaras Hindu University was the first unitary and residential teaching university of India built through public donations collected by Mahamana . 
It is also the first example of community participation in higher education in India . 
This university was established to bring about a synergy in ancient traditions and modern understandings as also to align Indian wisdom with western knowledge . 
Thus this great seat of learning not only embodied the assertion of Indian genius but also became a site for nourishing the holistic vision of nationalism and universal values . 
The noble work of this great patriot was acknowledged by Mahatma Gandhi on behalf of the nation in following words : 
" Great as are Malaviyaji ' s services to the country , I have no doubt that the Banaras Hindu University constitutes his greatest service and achievement , and he has worn himself out for the work that is dear to him as life itself . " 
I am happy to see that Malaviyaji ' s dream - child , the Banaras Hindu University , has moved from strength to strength and is soon going to complete its centenary . 
It is now one of the largest universities in India with maximum number of academic disciplines and departments . 
Its illustrious alumni are spread far and wide bringing laurels to the country and society . 
Universities are the fountainhead of knowledge and its dissemination . 
They have to discover fresh perspectives and assume new responsibilities to meet the imperatives of holistic human and social development . 
In this sense , higher education should offer a bridge between scientific knowledge and societal needs . 
Mahamana believed that human values and societal commitment must be inculcated in the students . 
In his words , " A teaching university would but half perform its function if it does not seek to develop the heart power of its scholar with the same solicitude with which it would develop their brain power . " 
Much later , Pt . Jawaharlal Nehru also expressed similar views about role and responsibilities of universities . 
He said , a university stands for humanism , for tolerance , for reason , for adventure of ideas and for the search of truth . 
It stands for the onward march of human race towards even higher objectives . 
If the universities discharge their duties adequately , then it is well with the nation and the people . 
Malaviyaji accorded great importance to the universal spread of learning and scholarship . 
He felt that education was the only way to revive the national pride and considered it a vehicle of social and cultural transformation . 
His vaulting ambition and bold vision could be seen in his words " Let us have charge of the education of the country with sufficient funds at our disposal , and on behalf of all my fellow - educationists in India , I promise that in course of a few short years we shall banish illiteracy from the land , and spread education and ideas of citizenship among our people to such an extent that the fog of communalism will vanish before the sun of nationalism , which it will be our earnest and proud endeavour to install in the hearts of our people . " 
The fact that illiteracy still remains to be banished and the fog of communalism is yet to vanish , reminds us of the unfinished task ahead of us . 
In a Convocation speech , Malaviyaji said two ancient injunctions that lay down a complete code of conduct for all humankind and all religion are " one should not do unto others that which he would dislike if it were done to him " ; and " whatever one desires for himself , that he should desire for others also " . 
Mahamana was a great votary of women ' s education . 
He said " education of our women is a matter of even greater importance than the education of our men . 
They are the mothers of the future generations of India . 
With this vision , he established a Women ' s College in this university . 
Mahamana ' s emphasis on women ' s education and empowerment should inspire us to redouble efforts in this regard . 
Permit me to use this occasion to express deep anguish and dismay over the recent incident of a brutal attack on a 23 year old girl in our capital city of Delhi . 
My heart goes out to this young girl and her family who have demonstrated extraordinary courage amidst the worst adversity and I request all of you to join me in praying for her speedy recovery . 
The nation has been witness to the anger and rage of our youth who have gathered in the streets of Delhi and other cities to demand stronger measures to ensure the safety of women and more stringent laws to provide deterrent penalty to criminals who endanger our women . 
I am certain that , the Government will take all necessary steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in future . 
Let me also remind our young friends that their anger is justified . 
I understand agony of your mind but please remember nothing is achieved through violence . 
Please take hold of your emotions and act with reason . 
The society as a whole has to work to eradicate this menace . 
We as a society must work towards changing negative perceptions about women . 
Women must be treated with respect and should be provided a safe , secure and congenial environment in which their talents can flower and they can contribute their full share in the building of our nation . 
Our history , traditions , religions and cultural values as well as the Constitution demands nothing less . 
I hope the faculty and students of an august institution like BHU will take the lead in spreading awareness and sensitizing society at large on gender issues . 
The proposed Centres on Human Values and Ethics and Inter - cultural Studies are timely and innovative . 
The integration of human values and ethics as well as the inculcation of tolerance and respect for pluralistic ethos in the mainstream education are an absolute imperative today . 
I congratulate the University for taking up this most important task with the help of the Ministry of Culture and the National Implementation Committee under the chairmanship of Dr . Karan Singh . 
It is appropriate that along with these centres , an archive of Mahamana ' s works and a special website to disseminate his thoughts and vision would be developed to create awareness and commitment to values , ethics and rights particularly among the youth for enrichment of social and human well being . 
The dream of Mahamana of cultural integration of India with the rest of Asia , especially with its South and South East Asian neighbours and promotion of dialogue among them as a means of mutual enrichment and nourishment has been taken up as an important agenda of the University . 
Such a dialogue will go a long way in renewing and strengthening the common cultural bond which has existed for centuries together . 
We could proceed to build the 21st century as the Asian Century only if we develop relations on the basis of knowledge and understanding of each other . 
I am happy that on the occasion of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahamana , the university is proposing to expand that vision to the other regions . 
The 150th Birth Anniversary is an opportunity to remember , cherish and act on ideas , vision , and activities of Mahamana Malaviyaji . 
That would be the best homage to a powerful visionary and nationalist leader of his times . 
I call upon Banaras Hindu University , which is a permanent monument to the vision of Mahamana , to continue to undertake efforts to build strong national character in our youth , through education based on Indian culture and moral values . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Fourth World Telugu Conference
It gives me great pleasure to attend the fourth World Telugu Conference and address an audience comprising eminent personalities from Telugu language and literature . 
I am happy to note that the Government of Andhra Pradesh , through this Conference is making a comprehensive attempt at promoting Telugu language and literature . 
I understand that exposition of books , conduct of cultural programmes , convening of seminars and publication of special magazines form part of the activities being organized in connection with the Conference . 
Telugu is one of the oldest classical languages of India . 
The word ' Telugu ' was probably derived from trilinga , or Trilinga Desa , " the country of the three lingas " , as according to legend , Lord Shiva descended as linga on three mountains namely , Kaleswara , Srisaila and Bhimeswara , which dots the Telugu region . 
Linguistic experts believe that Telugu was split from Proto - Dravidian languages between 1500 to 1000 BC . 
Inscriptions dating back to 400 BC , containing Telugu words , have been discovered in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh . 
Despite the vast passage of time , the language has been successful in maintaining its basic character , and at the same time , evolving as a modern language . 
The oldest works of Telugu literature are distinguished by their treatment of religious subjects . 
Between the Eleventh and Fourteenth Century of the current era , Nannaya , Tikkana and Errana , the poets known as the Trinity of Telugu Literature , composed the Andhra Mahabharatam . 
Telugu literature probably began to take shape with the composition of this great epic in Telugu . 
In the Thirteenth century , RanganathaRamayanam by Gonabudda Reddy was a pioneering work in Telugu on the theme of Ramayana . 
This great piece of literary work has now become integral to the Telugu culture . 
Telugu has rich literary and grammatical traditions . 
Various forms of literature abound in the Telugu language , such as Prabandhams , which are stories written in verse form . 
Telugu literature has also resorted to a unique form of verse called Champu , which is a beautiful mixture of prose and poetry . 
To make Telugu literature more comprehensible to the masses and draw more admirers to the language , Dwipadas , or couplets , and Satakas , or hundred verses , came to be written . 
These include the Dasarathi Sataka and Vemana Sataka . Telugu grammar owes much to Paravastu Chinnayya Soori , who undertook extensive research on the grammar of the language and wrote Baala Vyakaranamu in the 19th century . 
The Sixteenth and Seventeenth centuries are considered the golden age of Telugu literature . 
The first original poetic novel in Telugu literature , Kala Purnodayam , was written by Pingaliu Soorana , who was a pioneer in Telugu classical poetry . 
Krishna Deva Raya ' s Amuktha Malyadha , which blended the eternal and the temporal in a grand poetic style while describing an interesting tale , is considered a Maha Kavya , besides Peddhana ' s Manu Charithra . 
The modern trend in Telugu literature began in the Nineteenth century , marked by several influential writers . 
Gurajada Venkata Appa Rao , considered the father of modern Telugu literature , adhered to a poetic style that was pure , lucid , vivacious and clear . 
He wrote Kanya Sulkam , which is considered a landmark play for its clear message of social reform . 
Another Telugu novel dedicated to the cause of social emancipation is Mala Palli by Unnava Lakshmi Narayana , a freedom fighter , who also fought against untouchability . 
The literary movement in Telugu has continued with the same vigour in the post - Independence era . 
Several reputed writers have contributed to the growth and enrichment of this language . 
Viswanatha Satyanarayana , a versatile writer and author of more than 100 works , was bestowed with the Jnanpith Award in 1970 for his popular literary work , Ramayana Kalpa Vriksham . Dr . C . Narayana Reddy received the Jnanpith Award in 1988 for Viswambara . 
Four Indian languages namely Tamil , Sanskrit , Telugu and Kannada have been classified as classical languages in India . 
The Government of India created a category of ' classical languages ' in 2004 with strict entry criteria . 
Languages meeting parameters such as antiquity of 1500 to 2000 years of its early texts or recorded history , body of ancient literature or texts considered a valuable heritage by generations of speakers and original literary tradition , not borrowed from another language have been made eligible for being classified as classical . 
Telugu language , with its credentials of a long surviving rich cultural heritage , was declared a classical language in India in 2008 . 
Telugu is today spoken in several parts of the country such as Pondicherry , Tamil Nadu and Karnataka , besides Andhra Pradesh . 
Its reach also extends beyond the shores of the country . 
Telugu - speaking Indian diaspora are present in significant numbers in the USA , the UK , Australia , New Zealand , Canada , Malaysia , Singapore , Mauritius , and South Africa . 
It is important that the antiquity of Telugu language and civilization must be further explored . 
Having declared Telugu a classical language , it our responsibility to make every effort for its healthy growth and development so that posterity can benefit from the vast knowledge and ideas that rest within this language . 
There is a need to have concrete plans for creating awareness about Telugu language and literature among today ' s youth . 
Steps must be taken to consolidate all research works on Telugu history undertaken so far and to identify and encourage new research projects . 
The use of Telugu in public administration and education should also be popularized . 
Languages are not merely a means of communication . 
Our languages and literature are our heritage . 
They define and reflect the roots of our society . 
The promotion of literature cannot take place on the basis of Government support alone . 
I urge all stakeholders to contribute meaningfully towards preserving , encouraging and promoting Indian languages and literature . 
There is no dearth of creativity and talent in Indian languages . 
While Indian writing in English has excited the world , we need to create platforms to provide greater exposure to Indian languages so that the creativity embedded in Indian literature is spread across the world . 
The fourth World Telugu Conference is an opportunity for the eminent personalities , poets , writers , intellectuals and artists gathered here to give a new dimension and vision to the Telugu language . 
I am told that this Conference is being held in Andhra Pradesh after a long gap of 37 years . 
It would be useful to hold such conferences more frequently . 
I am sure that ideas and action points that emerge from this Conference will be examined by the State Government and measures undertaken to translate them into reality . 
I offer my best wishes to the large number of Telugu speakers who have assembled here for this important cause . 
I wish the Conference a grand success . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the convocation of SRM University
I am happy to participate in the Convocation of the SRM University . 
It is a pleasure to be amongst some of the brightest young minds in the country . 
I am very happy to know that SRM University is today a multi stream university with over 33000 students and 2300 faculty members , offering a wide range of programmes in Engineering , Management , Medicine , Science and Humanities . 
Students have a wide choice of cutting edge programmes including nanotechnology , bioinformatics , genetic engineering , remote sensing and GIS embedded systems , computer forensics , etc . to choose from . 
The University has a Sivaji Ganesan Film Institute which offers B . Sc in Film Technology , the first of its kind and an IAS Coaching Academy which offers training for the Civil Services Examinations . 
The Community Medicine department runs a rural health centre and an urban health centre . 
I believe SRM University is also the first private University in India to design , develop and launch a satellite - the SRMSAT in collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) . 
The SRMSAT has been in orbit since one year and has completed 5173 orbits . 
I am delighted to know foreign faculty members , flexible and dynamic curriculum , exciting research and global connections are features that set SRM apart . 
In the context of meeting the objectives of higher education in today ' s competitive world , the SRM University has played an outstanding role over the past 27 years . 
The country ' s economic progress is dependent on several critical factors . 
The quality of our human resources is amongst the most important of them . 
Higher education is the key to making available a large pool of skilled manpower for our nation . 
Higher education not only decides a student ' s career prospects , but also shapes his or her personality . 
Our country ' s education system is burdened with demands of both quantity and quality . 
The numbers of students who seek admissions in universities today far exceed the capacity of government educational institutions . 
We need many more universities to be able to address the demands of higher education . And along with quantity , we also need to focus on quality . 
The standards of higher education in India today need improvement . 
In ancient India , we had universities like Nalanda and Takshashila which had established themselves as international centers of educational excellence where students from all over the world came and studied . 
In contrast , many Indian students today choose to go abroad for higher studies . 
We need universities to provide quality education that meet international benchmarks . 
We must change the reality of our Universities not figuring in the list of top universities of the world . 
Indian universities should aim at becoming top educational institutions in the world with global standards of research , teaching and learning . 
With unlimited demands and limited resources , it is important that the private sector also contributes its best to the provision of higher education in India . 
The private sector has played a key role in higher education in other countries across the world . 
Many top universities including Harvard , Yale and Stanford are the result of efforts of the private sector . 
There is no reason why Indian private sector cannot achieve similar results . 
In India , students and parents are often skeptical of private universities . 
They prefer education in old and established public universities as opposed to private universities which are mostly newly built . 
To build the trust of the people , private universities must constantly prove themselves because they do not have the benefit of age . 
They must be able to promise a good future to the students and make sure that they fulfill all of their promises . 
I am happy to learn that this University has been able to secure good placements for its graduates . 
While I congratulate the University and the graduates for this , I must also point out that universities should have a vision beyond placements . 
Universities must satisfy the citizens that they are taking up the cause of education not for private profit but in public service . 
As Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya , the founder of Banaras Hindu University has said Universities should not merely turn out men and women as engineers , scientists , doctors , merchants , theologists , but also as people of high character , probity and honour , whose conduct through life would show that they bear the hallmark of a great university . 
Of course , financial resources are an important consideration for all universities . 
But , there must be a vision to create a world class institute and to nurture young people who will change the world into a better place for all of us . 
Higher education has made significant contribution to economic development , social progress and political democracy in independent India . 
But there is serious cause for concern at this juncture . 
As we stand on the threshold of the XII th Five Year Plan , challenges continue to exist with respect to quality and the provision of relevant education . 
Curricular reforms leading to regular revision and upgrading of curricula , introduction of semester system , choice - based credit system , and examination reforms are yet to take place in many higher educational institutions across the country . 
There is a clear , almost unanimous , view that higher education needs a systematic re - look , so that India can educate much larger numbers without diluting academic standards . 
The objectives of reform and change in our higher education system must be expansion , excellence and inclusion . 
I understand that the private sector today accounts for about four - fifths of enrolment in professional higher education . 
The standards of education , however , vary from institute to institute . 
It is essential that a transparent framework for better service delivery be established in the field of private education . 
The regulatory mechanism should facilitate accreditation of all educational institutions with clarity on incentives and consequences in order to improve quality , to ensure minimum benchmarks and to promote excellence in higher education . 
Shortage of good faculty is a matter of serious concern . 
While the requisite number of good quality teachers cannot be made available overnight , we must tackle the problem by bringing in innovative teaching methodologies such as technology - enabled learning and collaborative information and communication technologies . 
Our teachers must be exposed to larger number of refresher courses and seminars so as to be up - to - date with the latest concepts in their discipline . 
The SRM University has made a name for itself by imparting quality higher education in the private sector . 
It should now strive to spread to other Institutions in the country some of its models of teaching and curricula which are novel and can be emulated . 
The international advisory board it has established which advices the University on research , curricula and teaching methodology as well as the corporate advisory board which evaluates its engineering and management programmes based on industry trends , are important innovations which need to be adopted by others . 
The SRM University ' s programme of arranging opportunities for its students and faculty to meet Nobel Laureates is also worthy of special mention in this regard . 
I congratulate the Chancellor , Vice Chancellor , faculty members , and non - teaching staff of SRM University on their achievements and wish the University continued success in grooming young men and women to emerge as leaders in their chosen walks of life . 
As I have already pointed out , education should be seen as a stepping stone to character building and societal development . 
I hope that all of you will work diligently in future and contribute meaningfully towards nation - building . 
I urge each one of you graduating today to always remember that your mission in life should be to wipe every tear from every eye , as exhorted by the father of our nation , Mahatma Gandhi . 
Let me conclude quoting once again , Mahamana Pt . Madan Mohan Malviya Ji , who , in a convocation address to the Banaras Hindu University , said , continue your studies throughout your life . 
Be just and fear none . 
Fear only to do that which is ill and ignoble . Stand up for right . 
Love to serve your fellow - men . 
Love the motherland . 
Promote public weal . 
Do good wherever you get a chance for it . 
Love to give whatever you can spare . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of The Centennial Anniversary Celebrations Pandharpur Urban Co - Operative Bank
The origin of the Urban Co - operative movement in India can be traced to the close of 19th century . 
The first known mutual aid society in India was probably the " Anyonya Sahakaari Mandali " , organised in the formerly princely State of Baroda in 1889 . 
Urban Co - operative credit societies , in their formative phase , came to be recognised on a community basis to meet the consumption oriented credit needs of their members . 
Salary earners ' societies inculcating habits of thrift and self - help played an important role in popularizing the movement , especially amongst the middle class as well as organised labourers . 
The enactment of Co - operative Credit Societies Act in 1904 gave real encouragement to the movement . 
The first urban co - operative credit society movement was registered in Kanchipuram in the former Madras Province in October 1904 . 
The Co - operative Credit Societies Act 1904 was amended in 1912 with a view to broad basing it to enable organisation of non - credit societies . 
It soon became such a well established and useful system that during the banking crisis of 1913 - 14 , when no fewer than 57 joint stock banks collapsed , there was a flight of deposits from stock banks to co - operative urban banks . 
Over the years , urban co - operative banks have registered a significant growth in number , size and volume of business handled . 
Co - operative Banks in our country face many challenges and problems ; their performance across sectors , activities , and regions is variable ; they need to re - orient themselves by improving their efficiency , and have to develop themselves professionally to meet the requirements of the communities that they serve
They are perhaps still best way of reaching out into the vast hinterland of our nation where the poor and the marginalized sections may have few reliable banking options . 
The Pandharpur Urban Bank which was founded in 1912 with only 45 members and a small deposit of Rs . 957 / - , today , I understand , has 38152 members , 16 branches and a total business of over thousand crores . 
I am told that the bank has embarked into new areas and diversified its services considerably . 
It has also taken up several philanthropic and charitable initiatives over the years . 
I have no doubt that with its background of steady growth and sound policies , that Pandharpur Urban Co - operative Bank will continue to progress from strength to strength as it serves and supports the economic activities for this community . 
I once again offer my felicitations and best wishes to the Management and shareholders of the Pandharpur Urban Co - operative Bank on the occasion of its centenary celebrations . I wish all of you a very pleasant and happy New Year ! 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of convocation at The University of Mumbai
It gives me great pleasure to be present at this Convocation ceremony of the University of Mumbai . 
This institution is truly the fountainhead of higher education in India . 
It was founded in 1857 along with the Universities of erstwhile Madras and Kolkata , and had a key role in nurturing a number of leaders who led India to its independence . 
This University has been the alma mater of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar , Mahadev Govind Ranade , Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar , Mangesh Wagle , Waman Abaji Modak and the matriculating institution for the Father of our nation , Mahatma Gandhi . 
Today , each one of you students who are graduating join a band of great leaders and academicians who have graduated from this prestigious University . 
My heartiest congratulations to all of you . 
You fulfill this day not just your dreams but also the dreams of your parents , your family and your teachers . 
The University of Mumbai has been blessed by various philanthropists and benefactors who contributed to this Heritage Convocation Hall with its remarkable and ageless grandeur . 
Its stained glass work and its arches mutely exude beauty and enhance the awe that knowledge should rightly evoke amongst all of us present . 
I believe the Fort Campus is amongst the world ' s most beautiful campuses of its kind . 
This exemplifies the University ' s dedication to history and tradition in all its forms . 
Over the years the University has shown deep commitment to being a mother institution to its hundreds of affiliated institutions and colleges . 
It has shown remarkable ability to help found and develop and even grant autonomy to illustrious institutions such as Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute , St Xavier ' s College , S . P . College of Engineering and a group of Colleges under Somaiya Trust . 
Its own department , the Institute of Chemical Technology is now a deemed university . 
As the City of Mumbai sought to create learning environments in neighbourhoods , the University of Mumbai has reached out and done its duty with poise and alacrity . 
Today there are over 667 affiliated colleges and institutions it oversees and over 6 . 5 lakh students on its rolls . 
It also has 57 Departments covering a breadth of subjects ranging from Humanities , Technology , Management , Commerce , Law and more . 
As Mumbai has grown , so has the University of Mumbai . 
It has campuses and sub - campuses from the Konkan coast to the teeming Mumbai Metropolitan expanse and reaching hinterland Thane district . 
This has enabled the University of Mumbai enroll and provide access to both urban and rural citizens . 
University of Mumbai has a glorious history and must rededicate itself to the building of India ' s future . 
With India ' s youth seeking education and productive roles in society , it is even more critical that Universities reinvent themselves to deliver relevant knowledge and actionable skills . 
The father of our Nation , Mahatma Gandhi has said , " Real education consists in drawing the best out of yourself . 
What better book can there be than the book of humanity ? " Today when our youth face moral dilemmas , caught as they are between traditional values and western culture , Bapu ' s exhortation to follow the book of humanity can set many doubts at rest . 
Once we imbibe the book of humanity , many of the divisions and conflicts in society will meet their end . 
For India to sit at the high table of global powers , it has to prepare its youth for an ever - shrinking world that shares resources as well as responsibilities through being knowledgeable , capable and sensitive to environmental and social issues . 
Universities will need to reinvent themselves as enablers of society rather than gatekeepers of higher education . 
The youth of our nation should be empowered to take our great nation , forward in leaps and bounds . 
I am happy to note that the University of Mumbai has maintained a focus on new technologies and cutting edge thinking . 
It has started new centres such as the Centre for Nanotechnology and also new international collaborations in the area of sustainable development technologies and approaches . 
More and more such initiatives are needed for the developing world to understand each other and their special capabilities , creating space for new thinking in climate change and sustainability . 
As you stand here after being granted degrees and honours , I would like to remind you that the purpose of education is not a good job or income but using the knowledge you have acquired in the service of the nation and mankind . 
I sincerely hope that all of you will show the utmost zeal and love for humankind so that a better world can be gifted to our future generations . 
In the age of smart phones and tablet computers , ideas now travel at the speed of thought . 
It is important for us to remain up to date with what is happening in the world . 
I am very happy to know that the University of Mumbai has introduced far - reaching changes in its examination technology through bar coding and use of communication technology to improve the processes . 
The day is not far when we will see the emergence of a higher education system based on a seamless network of knowledge and learning as well as assessments of skill . 
This will mean the teaching and learning environment will have to radically change . 
Delivering lectures and presenting thought through written material is going to be ancillary to creating learning environments . 
Professors , Lecturers and Teachers will emerge as facilitators of thought through multiple technology platforms and pathways . 
This means even the teaching fraternity will have relearn , reengage and retrain themselves for the immediate future . 
At the same time , they must keep in mind the words of Mahatma Gandhi , while speaking to students at Sevagram in 1942 " A teacher who establishes rapport with the taught , becomes one with them , learns more from them than he teaches them . 
A true teacher regards himself as a student of his students . 
If you will teach your pupils with this attitude , you will benefit much from them . 
I call upon the City of Mumbai and the Government of Maharashtra to be more proactive in preparing and providing for this new future . 
Just as a few good men stepped up and helped build this university by supporting its construction and development in its early years , the State of Maharashtra and citizens of Mumbai will need to come up with ways and means to enable greater funding and partnerships with industry houses , other universities and central government bodies . 
India has shown itself to be a secular , diverse and pluralistic society which is able to deal with change , challenges and aspirations over the last few decades . 
This is only due to its abiding faith and belief in education . 
India ' s future and that of the world it hopes to lead , as a great and powerful nation , is in the hands of its youth . 
The demographic dividend of its youth can only be reaped through universities and institutions that commit themselves to delivering distributed learning environments . 
Every aspiring student should find the university reaching him and not the other way around . 
In conclusion , let me remind you of what Swami Vivekananda said on the role and relevance of education . 
He said , " The education which does not help the common mass of people to equip themselves for the struggle of life , which does not bring out the strength of character , a spirit of philanthropy , and the courage of a lion - - is it worth the name ? " 
We need to reflect on his profound words and re - orient our thinking and approach towards education . 
All of you graduates of the University of Mumbai are a living tribute to the faculty , staff and students who have , over the years , worked selflessly to bring the University to its present position of pre - eminence . 
I congratulate all the students on whom the University has conferred diplomas , degrees and certificates . 
This occasion is a reaffirmation that you have imbibed the knowledge and skills to face the world outside . 
I urge you to stride onto your paths in life with a positive attitude and strong spirit . 
Besides training and education , what will keep you in good stead is strength of character , strength of mind and strength of purpose . 
I would like you to remember that what you do with knowledge is always up to you , but knowledge used in the service of the nation and mankind is always closer to God ' s intention . 
I wish the University of Mumbai all the best in its endeavors and urge it to do its utmost to become a world class institution . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of The Platinum Jubilee of Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan and 125th Birth Anniversary of Dr . K . M . 
I am delighted to be here today to inaugurate the Platinum Jubilee celebrations of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and the 125th Birth Anniversary of its illustrious founder . 
Dr . K . M . Munshi . Dr . K . M Munshi was a true visionary , institution - builder and a great son of India . 
He was of a small build . 
But there was nothing small in what he achieved during his life time . 
He was a towering personality who became a legend in his own life time . 
Munshiji demonstrated excellence in diverse fields of human endeavour . 
He was a writer , speaker , novelist , lawyer , teacher , Indologist , Constitutional expert , Administrator , Statesman , patriot and a promoter and sustainer of cultural , ethical and moral values . 
His endeavor of establishing Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan , in 1938 , was one of the most important steps in a series of selfless efforts put in by him in emancipating the citizenry of this nation . 
The founding of the Bhavan echoed his deeply entrenched belief in the instrument of education , which he firmly believed could offer wings to the growth and development of India . 
Born in the town of Bharuch , Gujarat , 125 years ago , Munshiji was always an excellent student . 
His life was tremendously influenced by Sri Aurobindo Ghosh . He took up law at the University of Bombay and enrolled himself as an advocate in 1913 . 
He acquired the reputation of a diligent and hardworking lawyer within a short span of time . 
During World War I , he was greatly influenced by Dr . Annie Besant ' s Home Rule Movement until he came across a relatively better concept of governance which Gandhiji offered . 
This led him to offer his whole hearted support for Sardar Patel ' s Bardoli movement and Gandhiji ' s salt satyagraha . 
His active participation brought him in close quarters with Gandhiji and Sardar Patel , who mobilized his active participation within the Congress . 
He started the movement for a Parliamentary wing of the Congress , became Secretary of the Congress Parliamentary Board in 1938 and served in the Central Legislative Assembly in the 1930s . 
Gandhiji ignited Munshiji ' s zeal to serve the nation through active politics . 
It is said that Aurobindo Ghosh instilled in him the love for jnanayoga while Gandhiji made him a Karmayogi . 
Munshiji ' s solidarity and devotion to the cause of the nation was unparalleled . 
When Nizam of Hyderabad was stubborn in acceding to the Union , it was Munshiji who was sent as the Agent General of the Government of India to Hyderabad in 1947 . 
He served there until its final accession in 1948 . 
It is said that if Sardar Patel was the architect of Hyderabad ' s accession to India , Munshiji was the engineer in the field . 
Acknowledging Munshiji ' s role , Sardar Patel wrote : 
" On behalf of the Government , I wish to say that we are deeply conscious of the high sense of public duty that induced you to accept this office and the very able manner in which you discharged the duties entrusted to you which contributed in no small measure to the final result . " 
Munshiji ' s contributions as Union Minister of Food and Agriculture from 1950 - 52 and Governor of the State of Uttar Pradesh from 1952 to 1957 were invaluable . 
He also made far reaching contribution to the shaping of the Indian Constitution . 
His incisive understanding of law and insight into India ' s cultural fabric made him one of the most outstanding members of the Constituent Assembly . 
What might amaze many is that besides being on the Drafting committee , he was member of as many as eleven Committees , which made him perhaps the only Indian who played such a pervasive role in the drafting of the Constitution . 
The principle of guaranteeing to every person equal protection of the laws was the result of a draft jointly written by Munshiji and Dr . Ambedkar . 
Munshiji ' s sense of equality did not confine itself to mere legal protection . 
He strongly advocated widow remarriage and to set an example , himself married a widow Lilavati Sheth in 1926 . 
Societal discrimination for delinquent children drove him to found a Children ' s Home for delinquent children at Chembur , Bombay in 1939 . 
His love and service to countrymen was thus unparalleled and driven by a strong sense of personal commitment . 
A prolific writer and conscientious journalist , Munshiji started a Gujarati monthly called Bhargava , was joint - editor of Young India , and he started the Bhavan ' s Journal in 1954 . 
Some of his better - known books are : Gujarat and its Literature , Akhand Hindustan , Glory that was Gujardesh , The Ruin that Britain Wrought , The End of an Era , and Shishu ane Sakhi . 
He was also President of the Sanskrit Viswa Parishad , the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad , and the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan . 
Munshiji was one among three great dreamers of our country . 
One was Mahatma Gandhi himself , who dreamt of a world without violence , a world of love and compassion . 
The second dreamer was Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who dreamt of an India strong , united and democratic , playing an important role in the world . 
Munshiji was the third dreamer . 
He dreamt of a cultural renaissance built on modifying the spiritual heritage of our country to suit modern conditions . 
He wanted to make sure that every young person of his times and of the future should imbibe and benefit from India ' s cultural and spiritual heritage . 
Munshiji wrote : 
The values of a culture are recaptured for each generation by a subtle process of re - interpretation , reintegration and adaptation . 
When the Culture is living , the promising young man and woman of the generation receive the impact of its fundamental values . 
The sensitive and the vigorous among them become each a human laboratory , which purifies the fundamental values relating them afresh to the central idea ; stimulates them to meet the needs of the times ; reintegrate the subsidiary values with the fresh vigour of the new interpretation and shapes the traditions and institutions not only without impairing the strength of the collective will , but by giving it a new edge . 
Three quarters of a century ago , Munshiji could foretell the impending turmoil over moral and ethical values . 
He believed that freedom would be meaningless and worthless unless cultural , ethical , and moral values are enshrined in the hearts and minds of our people . 
Munshiji therefore felt the need to create an institution that could begin to bring about in a small way a tangible change through education . 
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan which was started as an institution is now a massive cultural and educational movement . 
It is a moral movement that steers people towards a life guided by ethics . 
The Bhavan , is today rendering yeoman service to the people of our nation and through them to entire human kind . 
The Bhavan has not merely adopted , as its motto the Rig Vedic proclamation " Vasudaiva Kutumbakam " , but proves it through its words and deeds . 
What Munshiji expected to achieve through the Bhavan can be narrowed down to three main points : 
Firstly , he wanted the other worldliness in the outlook of people to be replaced by a sense of joy in the life as it is to be lived . 
Secondly , he felt that outmoded traditions which stifle the creative vitality of individual and collective life must be replaced by a vigorous flexible attitude to life . 
And , thirdly , the fundamental values which have given ageless inspiration to our culture had to be captured afresh for our generation . 
Movements such as the Bhavan are the need of the day . 
The Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan has stood the test of time and been a beacon light guiding Indians and foreigners alike in their path to live a balanced and wholesome life . 
With 119 centers in India and around 7 centers abroad including the United States and the United Kingdom , Munshiji ' s dream of promoting ethical and spiritual values in day to day life is successfully accomplished by the Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan . 
I pay my compliments to the staff of Bharatiya Viday Bhawan for their tireless efforts in translating Munshiji vision into reality . 
The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan confers its highest honour - its Honorary Membership on those who have rendered outstanding services to the people of our country as well as the world . 
It has conferred this honour on three outstanding citizens of our country today . 
Each one of them is a brilliant star in their chosen field of activity . 
I congratulate Bhavan on its wonderful choice . 
Shrimati Kishori Amonkar , a towering maestro of Hindustani Shashtriya Sangeet , and legendary performer of Jaipur - atrauli Gharana , has given us pure joy for over half a century . 
Shrimati Ila Bhatt , Gandhian , is an exemplary champion of social causes . 
Her work has brought her and our country world renown and recognition . 
She has transformed poor and under - privileged women into proud , confident , self - organized and courageous citizens of our country . 
Shri . N . R . Narayanamoorthy , who led our nation on the path of becoming a world leader in Information Technology , is an inspiration to the youth of our country . 
I take great pleasure in inaugurating the celebrations of the Platinum Jubilee of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and the 125th Birth Anniversary of its great founder , Kulapati K . M . Munshi . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the memorial lecture on Late Shri P . V . Narasimha Rao
I am indeed happy to be here today to deliver the first memorial lecture of a great son of our soil , the late Shri P . V . Narasimha Rao
He was our Prime Minister , a deft practitioner of realpolitik , a great intellectual , an erudite scholar , thinker , writer and linguist and someone who would be remembered for his historic contributions to the country . 
Born in a remote village of Andhra Pradesh , he strived hard for the welfare of the country and rose to be its Prime Minister . 
Influenced early in life by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru , his disposition to devote his life for society was clear from his spirited participation in the nation ' s freedom struggle starting when he was only around 16 years of age . 
Shri Rao was a leader who inspired many . 
I too am one of them . 
I had the opportunity to work with Shri Rao for many years and was impressed by his political sagacity , his depth of comprehension of complex issues and his steely resolve to find solutions to even the most intractable of them . 
Late Shri Narasimha Rao , who was fondly called PV by many , will be remembered for his many contributions to the nation foremost amongst which , in my opinion , is his sterling success in taking the nation to the next level of reforms in 1991 . 
These economic reforms enabled the nation to traverse the path of realization of its economic potential . 
He assumed the reins of the Prime Minister of India at a time when the country was confronted by severe economic problems . 
It was a period when India ' s foreign currency reserves had plummeted to around US $ 1 billion that was barely sufficient to finance two weeks of imports . 
Faced with the financial crisis , in an unprecedented and courageous move , he departed from the usual policy of appointing a senior political leader as the Finance Minister . 
Instead , he appointed Dr . Manmohan Singh our present Prime Minister as Finance Minister . 
He is an economic administrator and a well - known economist himself . 
He gained rich experience in policy making as the Economic Affairs Secretary and RBI Governor . 
He was entrusted as the doctor , with the responsibility of nursing and strengthening the economy . 
Shri Rao displayed great foresight in making this choice and as the present bears witness , this was a brilliant decision that could not have come at a more appropriate time . 
Shri Rao gave Dr . Manmohan Singh full freedom to navigate the crisis and introduce far - reaching economic reforms . 
He lent full support to Dr . Manmohan Singh and the two together , took the nation on a path that has made India an economic powerhouse that the world today admires . 
The duo of the practical politician and the economist Finance Minister , thus steered the nation through the economic crisis , admirably ushering in the seminal policy of economic liberalization . 
In fact , Shri Rao had himself spearheaded the move for dismantling the license regime as the Prime Minister while holding additional charge of the Industry Ministry . 
That a large number of big Indian corporate houses have today become the powerhouses of growth and have earned their spurs across the globe is in part on account of the vision of Shri Rao . 
It is these economic reforms that were ushered in during his tenure as the Prime Minister , that have charted the course of our economic history since then . 
The economic reforms unlocked the entrepreneurial skills of the Indian mind cutting across the various sectors of the economy . 
In the financial sector , measures to bring capital adequacy and prudent norms for asset classification in our banks , licensing of new private banks , besides gradual decontrol of foreign exchange and currency convertibility were implemented . 
With the objective of providing market orientation and to make our public sector enterprises competitive , private sector participation was encouraged through privatization and disinvestment . 
Other sectoral reforms such as liberalization of foreign investment norms , external trade and tax reforms spawned the much - needed change in the incentive structure of the economy . 
These measures unleashed the productive and competitive spirit dormant in our businesses . 
The reforms in many ways signaled the transformation of the ' State ' as a facilitator than as a direct provider of goods and services . 
The nature of the economic reforms appeared to some as revolutionary and encouraged many to oppose them . 
But it did not dampen the enthusiasm of Shri Rao who faced strong political challenges to sustain these reforms . 
It required the strong courage and conviction that Late Shri Narasimha Rao displayed in abundant measure . 
But , the adoption of the policy of liberalization did not signal the end of the role of the state in pursuing the important task of social development . 
This is where the pragmatism of Shri Rao was writ large . 
While he recognized the need for a greater role for the private sector in the development of the nation ' s economy , he simultaneously emphasized the importance of state intervention in the development of human capital that was given the position of primacy in the Eighth Five Year Plan . 
Towards the achievement of this goal , emphasis was laid on employment generation , literacy , education , health , drinking water and provision of adequate food and basic infrastructure . 
The Government was fully willing to take the primary responsibility for providing the basic elements that would help the development of human capital . 
These policies resulted in greater employment , reduction in poverty and self - sufficiency in agriculture and achieving 6 . 5 % economic growth , the highest ever until then for any Five Year plan period . 
Another important decision was India ' s accession to the WTO in January 1995 and Shri Rao ' s role in it was pivotal . 
The Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations , wide ranging agreements including the creation of WTO to subsume GATT had come to a halt and India ' s position under the then Government of VP Singh was hesitant and ambivalent . 
The implications of India acceding to an all - encompassing multilateral trade regime met with strong domestic opposition . 
I , as the then Commerce Minister , signed the multilateral WTO Trade Agreement at Marrakesh in April 1994 along with other nations . 
His achievements were not limited to the economic sector alone . 
Displaying great political sagacity , he was able to resolve many complex problems . 
It was during his term as the Prime Minister that the extremist activities in Punjab saw its end . 
A popular government was able to function after the elections under Beant Singh . 
In ending the occupation of the Hazratbal shrine in Jammu & Kashmir by terrorist in 1993 without any damage to the holy shrine . 
Late Narasimha Rao had a unique functioning style . 
He understood the virtue of patience and depending on the exigencies of the situation , he was ready to wait till he achieved consensus . 
When he decided to refrain from acting , it was with a singular purpose . 
To quote him : " When I don ' t make a decision , it is not that I don ' t think about it . 
I think about it and make a decision not to make a decision . 
But , when it came to matters of administration and governance , his decision making abilities were writ large in the speed and decisive manner in which they were implemented . 
It was his unique style and political deftness that made him successful in leading a Congress minority Government after the 1991 General elections that gave the Congress party 232 MPs in the 10th Lok Sabha . 
Yet his Government survived for the full five - year term and he achieved his feat laying the foundation for politics based on consensus . 
Shri Rao is also credited with exemplary achievement in the foreign policy . 
He was the Minister for External Affairs for around seven years during which he gave the nation some new foreign policy focus . 
He steered the nation in the aftermath of Cold War building strong relations across the world and gave further impetus to the nation ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programme . 
The visionary that he was , late Narasimha Rao launched the ' Look East ' policy and gave India ' s engagement with ASEAN a different meaning . India became a Sectoral Dialogue partner of ASEAN in 1992 and a full Dialogue Partner in 1996 . 
he different dimensions of engagement culminating in Summit level partnership with ASEAN in the areas of trade , economic , culture and politics have since gained in strength bringing many benefits to our country and are directly attributable to the vision of Shri Rao . 
As the Minister for Human Resources Development , he implemented the vision of late Shri Rajiv Gandhi to bring quality education to the poor and the marginalised by establishing the Navodaya Vidyalayas . 
These have today grown into a chain of schools that is providing education to about 1 . 60 lakh students from the marginalised sections of the society . 
It is heartening to know that around 77 % of students of these schools hail from rural areas . 
And most importantly these schools have also had the highest pass percentage in Class X and XII , amongst all categories of schools . 
Shri Rao ' s contribution also immensely benefited his home state of Andhra Pradesh . 
First as a Minister and then as Chief Minister , he is credited with several far - reaching reforms . 
As the Minister of Education in Andhra Pradesh , he took several initiatives that made the educational institutions more responsive to the needs of students . 
He gave special emphasis on upgrading education in the field of Science and Technology . 
As Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh from 1971 to 1973 , he was steadfast in his commitments towards the implementation of Land Ceiling Act in the State . 
This Act became one of the most effective Land Ceiling Acts in the country . 
He had initiated these reforms amidst strong opposition with the singular goal of ushering in equity by bring benefit to the poor and the landless . 
This made him one of the most forwarded - looking Chief Ministers of the state and his time . 
Behind the political persona of Late Shri Narasimha Rao , which people are familiar with , there was also a man of letters , a distinguished scholars and linguist , whose command over 16 languages pleasantly surprised both Indians and foreigners alike . 
He wrote fictions in Hindi , Marathi and Telugu , and translated literary works . 
His novel , ' The Insider ' , describes a man ' s rise through the ranks of Indian politics won accolades for its treatment of the contemporary politics in India . 
The late Shri P . V . Narasimha Rao will be remembered as a great leader of our country and one who showed the courage of conviction in leading the nation through the right path of reforms against the heaviest odds . 
Shri Narasimha Rao is one of the few leaders who attracted admirers of different political hues . 
The nation would remember him with gratitude . 
And I am particularly delighted in having been given the opportunity to deliver the first lecture in his memory . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of 100th session of Indian Science Congress
At the outset , I wish the participants to the Centenary session of Indian Science Congress and the people of the Nation , a purposeful and productive New Year . 
The Prime Minister of India generally inaugurates the annual sessions of Indian Science Congress . 
My warmest congratulations to the Indian Science Congress on the occasion of the celebration of their centenary . 
In the current year , the Association has elected the Prime Minister as its General President . 
I congratulate Dr . Manmohan Singh for being elected as the General President of Indian Science Congress in this historic year . 
It is a befitting honour . I can from personal experience vouchsafe the abiding faith of Dr . Manmohan Singh on education , science and technology . 
The good performance of science and technology sector in the recent years , I believe , owes greatly to the generous government support for S & T catalysed by the Prime Minister . 
I am an alumnus of Calcutta University . Naturally , I am delighted to participate in a function co - organized by Calcutta University . 
As an alumnus , I fondly remember defining role of this university and Sir Asutosh Mukherjee in nurturing the Indian Science Congress in the early years . 
Kolkata has remained historically a city of culture , of knowledge . 
All Nobel Prizes awarded for work from India are somehow linked to the city of Kolkata . 
Sir Ronald Ross carried out his pioneering research on Malaria in this city for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902 . 
Sir CV Raman’s remarkable discovery , the Raman Effect , for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930 , was made here in Kolkata . 
The legendry Rabindranath Tagore and Mother Teresa were also awarded Noble Prizes for their work carried out in Kolkata . 
The earliest organizations associated with science—The Asiatic Society , The Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science and the Indian Science Congress Association were established here . 
These organizations gave rise to celebrated luminaries in science who promoted a scientific culture . 
Sir JC Bose , Prof . Satyendra Nath Bose , PC Ray , Meghnad Saha and many others who built the edifice of modern science in the country . 
Sir JC Bose is hailed as the first of modern scientists of this country . 
His original contributions to the invention of radio are well known . 
The recent discovery of Higgs - boson particle highlights the epoch making contributions of Prof . Satyendra Nath Bose to particle physics . 
I do hope that the modern scientists of this city would emulate the examples of these leaders of science of the past . 
ISCA presented me a compilation of all the addresses of General Presidents of the Association as well as the inaugural addresses delivered over the years . 
These make fascinating reading . In a sense , these capture the history of Indian science as it evolved over the past 100 years . 
In the year 1957 , I was a student at Calcutta University . In that year , the Prime Minister of India Pandit Nehru was the Chief Guest . 
The Chief Minister of Bengal , the visionary Prof BC Roy was the President of the Science Congress . 
The topic of BC Roy ' s address to the Congress was " On Science for Human Welfare and Development of Country” . 
The topic then was akin to the theme of the present session - ' Science for Shaping Future of India ' . I was greatly touched by BC Roy ' s concluding message : 
" The clouds of time may have hidden for us innumerable problems , trials and dangers , yet time may also reveal solutions of unknown difficulties or delightful surprises which man with his knowledge of Science should be prepared to turn to his advantage with faith , hope and good will . ”
Let me congratulate the Indian Science Congress for selecting " Science for Shaping Future of India” as the focal theme for its 100th Session . 
Science has to be closely linked to a culture within the society which is built on scientific knowledge . 
It calls for a scientific temper that Pt . Nehru always used to talk about . 
Scientific culture demands that choices and decisions are made by individuals , society and the nation on the basis of scientific logic . 
Indian economy has been following a new paradigm of development ; faster , sustainable and inclusive growth with equity . 
It is a new concept because it combines the faster growth with objectives of inclusiveness and sustainability . 
How to harness the forces of science , technology and innovation to achieve this end calls for deep deliberation . 
I am sure , you will discuss this in all its aspects and implications with the seriousness that it demands . 
Science is one of the creative endeavours of human mind . 
Pursuit of Science as a personal passion can not be regulated or directed when the thrill of pursuit is in " Knowing the truth of Nature” . 
Prepared and creative minds are required to observe the revelations of Nature . 
Science seeks universal and fundamental truth . Culture of Excellence is the second nature of creative scientists . 
Eminent scientists of the world have always been concerned as to how their understanding of natural phenomena could be applied to solve social problems of the future . 
Sir JC Bose , more than a century ago , on 5th March 1885 , wrote in his diary , I have been thinking whether the solar energy that is wasted in tropical regions in a new way could be utilized . Of course trees conserve the solar energy . 
Of course trees conserve the solar energy . 
But is there no other way of directly utilizing the radiant energy of the sun ? 
The seed for artificial photosynthesis was sown then . 
Even now it is an active area of research pursuit globally . 
His disciple Prof . Satyendra Nath Bose was a powerful communicator and an inspired teacher . 
He delivered lectures on ‘power’ and ‘nuclear energy’ in a language that lay people could understand . 
He motivated generation of people to move towards scientific endeavour . 
Public and political understanding of science is crucial . 
For that , I would like to urge upon you all to apply modern tools for communicating science in a manner that can be understood by the common man . 
This understanding would contribute to the creation of a science culture in the Indian society . 
The prime concern of any government in a country is enhancing the well being of its people . 
Technology has the power of changing the lives of the people by creating physical well being . 
Countries have undergone transformational changes , all in one generation , from a relatively weak to an emerging economy . 
In this transformational change , technology - led economic growth has played a key role . 
While technology can be considered a logical extension of knowledge gained from science , it is much more than mere application of science . 
Technology is contextual . 
We all are a witness to the transformational changes being brought about by mobile telephony and internet . 
The number of mobile phone users in India was around 19 crore in October 2012 which is the second highest in the world after China . 
The mobile phone density of 74 . 21 per cent of India compares favourably with the other top ranking countries . 
Another marvel of technology—the internet—has become a vital source of information and communication . India ranks third after China and USA in terms of number of internet users . 
However , the penetration of internet use as the percentage of the population is only 11 . 4 indicating the huge potential for future growth . 
Another transformational application of technology is Aadhaar project which focuses on electronic transfer of benefits directly to the beneficiaries of various social sector schemes . 
I understand the roll out of Aadhaar enabled service delivery has already started in twenty districts . 
In the Budget 2012 - 13 , a target for covering fifty districts has been set which , I am sure , will be met . 
It is essential to innovate if we have to compete in a globalised economy . India has declared 2010 - 20 as the decade of innovation . 
The announcement of Science , Technology and Innovation Policy today lays the roadmap for the development of an eco system for innovations and for encouraging , recognizing and rewarding the innovators in the society , especially the grass root innovators who through their genius are adding value to the processes which directly impact the local population . 
The new STI policy has also addressed the issue of right - sizing our research and development system . 
Balanced economic growth especially in emerging economies like India is of paramount importance . 
Productive engagement of our youth in agriculture , manufacturing and value based services holds the key for a balanced growth of the country . 
The new STI Policy , I am confident , will pave the technology - led path for change ensuring prosperity with peace and inclusiveness . 
We need an educational system which lays importance on development of a scientific culture within the society . 
Mere economic growth without the attendant knowledge capacity to manage the dimensions of change would neither suffice nor be appropriate . 
Our ancient universities , whether these be Nalanda or Taxila , focused on value based holistic education . 
Perhaps it is appropriate to quote from an address of Rabindranath Tagore delivered ninety years ago : 
" You know the traditions of our country are never to accept any material fees from the students in return for teaching , because we consider in India that one who has knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students " . 
Swami Vivekananda always spoke of fusion of cultural values of the orient with practical methods of the occident . Innovation is a modern means of converting knowledge into social value and wealth . 
Indian philosophy , seeks to balance the pursuit of wealth and material success with the mastery of the self and the quest of inner happiness . 
The deeply introspective , yet practical , wisdom of Indian philosophy must find resonance in the metaphor of competition and conquest popularized in the modern world . 
I conclude with a quote from Swami Vivekananda , he said : 
" No nation can be said to have become civilized , only because it has succeeded in increasing the comforts of material life by bringing into use lots of machinery and things of that sort . . . . In this age as on the one hand people have to be intensely practical , so on the other , they have to acquire deep spiritual knowledge " . 
I would like to call upon the scientific community to work for the promotion of a scientific culture for shaping our future in which prosperity and peace , excellence and equity and oriental values and occidental methods of science converge and co - exist . 
India is expected to emerge as a major economic power by 2035 . We should also emerge as a major knowledge power with high human and societal values . 
Let me mention in this regard that it has been 83 long years since CV Raman won the Nobel Prize for Physics . Another Nobel Prize in the sciences is long overdue for India . 
I call upon scientific fraternity gathered here to rise upto this challenge and work towards this goal in a time bound manner . 
With these words , I formally inaugurate the 100th session of Indian Science Congress . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the banquet in honour of The President of The Republic of Mauritius , H . E . Mr . Rajeswur Puryag
It gives me great pleasure to extend a warm welcome to you and your distinguished delegation on your first State Visit to India . 
You are a long standing friend of India and a strong advocate of closer ties between India and Mauritius . 
Excellency , our nations , bound by our historical ties share a unique warmth and friendship built on the foundation of close bonds between our peoples . 
Present - day Mauritius is home to successful and progressive persons of Indian origin who have carved a niche for themselves in the country through their hard work and commitment to its progress . 
Since the days of Mahatma Gandhi ' s deep interest in Mauritius and the active involvement of Manilal Doctor in advocating social and political change in Mauritius in the early 1900s , Mauritius has achieved much as an independent and progressive nation . 
The father of modern Mauritius , Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam , had laid the foundations for democracy and the prosperity that your people enjoy today . 
India welcomes the socio - economic progress made by Mauritius in a short span of over four decades after its independence . 
Despite the downturn that impacted the global economy , Mauritius has shown remarkable resilience and Mauritians have persevered to maintain their impressive economic growth and high standard of living . 
The long - standing ties of co - operation between India and Mauritius have today evolved into a modern and vibrant partnership involving key sectors on both sides . 
This has been facilitated by our regular dialogue and inter - Governmental initiatives operationalised through a framework of bilateral agreements , public and private sector joint ventures and robust people - to - people contacts . 
he strong synergies and complementarities between our two economies indicate that there still remains a vast untapped potential - especially in the trade , investment , developmental and infrastructure sectors . 
We have a long history of co - operation in international fora . 
On issues of primary importance to us - including the fight against terrorism and our rightful claim to a permanent seat at the UN Security Council , we appreciate the shared perception and support of Mauritius . 
We look forward to working with you for the long term interests of both our countries - including on regional and global issues where we have similar concerns . 
I also take this opportunity to emphasise that the safety and security of our respective peoples should remain a high priority in our bilateral agenda
Peace and stability throughout the region of the Indian Ocean that washes our shores is an objective that we both share . 
We face the common challenge of maritime piracy , that must be overcome by the collective efforts of all the littoral states that are affected . 
We value the active support and involvement of the Government of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation . 
Mauritius was the venue for the 6th Overseas Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention held recently . 
I take this opportunity to thank your Government , and the people of Mauritius for welcoming this multi - dimensional event with enthusiasm . 
They have been active participants in the events and initiatives involving the 27 million - strong Indian diaspora . 
We are particularly honoured that you will be Chief Guest at this year ' s Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention in Kochi . 
India ' s commitment to the progress and prosperity of Mauritius remains firm . 
We have taken several decisions on bilateral assistance and the economic package that we have discussed during your visit will , no doubt , take us forward towards our common objectives . 
We are fully confident that during your Presidency , the cherished ties , fraternal support and co - operation between our two countries will be strengthened and that our joint initiatives for the mutual benefit of our peoples will bring more progress and prosperity to them . 
With these words , Distinguished Guests , Ladies and Gentlemen , may I request you to join me in a toast : 
- To the health and personal well being of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Mauritius and Mrs . Aneetah Purryag ; 
- To the enduring tradition of close friendship and co - operation between India and Mauritius ; and
- To the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of the Republic of Mauritius . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Valedictory Function of The 11th Pravasi Bhartiya Divas
I am happy to be here amongst your midst to deliver the Valedictory Address of the Eleventh Pravasi Bharatiya Divas . 
Today is an important day in the history of our country as this is the day when the father of our nation , Mahatma Gandhi , returned from South Africa 98 years ago . 
It is befitting that January 9 has been chosen as the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas for today is a sort of homecoming for the Pravasis , symbolic though it may be . 
It also gives the nation an occasion to renew and strengthen our bonds with the its diaspora , to celebrate and acknowledge the exemplary work done by you all in the various fields in your adopted country . 
It is appropriate that this event is also being held in Kerala as the state has signified in many ways how the diaspora can contribute to the welfare of the state with which they are so closely linked . 
Hundreds of thousands of workers and professionals from this state have migrated abroad , particularly to Gulf countries and their contribution to the welfare of the state has been remarkable . 
They have also played a significant role in advancing the cause of the society by making it a state that has some of the best indices in the human development index . 
Non Resident Keralites have been important agents in the State ' s promotion of sustainable development and socio - economic transformation . 
Their contribution to the state by way of investments and remittances has been unparalleled . 
According to a study published by the Centre for Development Studies , Thiruvunanthapuram , in 2011 , approximately Rs . 49 , 695 crore was remitted by emigrants from Kerala . 
The State Government too has embraced several steps to deal with the issues of the diaspora ; important among them was the creation of a separate organization , called Non Resident Keralites ' Affairs Department , in the state in 1996 . 
The Indian diaspora has made our nation proud through the significant contributions that they have made to the development of the nations which they have chosen to make their homes . 
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that today there are atleast 5 Heads of States or Heads of Governments and over 70 senior political leaders such as Deputy Heads of State , Speakers and Ministers in various countries who can trace their roots to India . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , His Excellency Shri Rajkeswur Purryag , the President of Mauritius is one such eminent personality . 
He epitomizes the spirit of leadership and public service that the people of Indian origin have so famously exhibited . 
We are delighted and grateful that he is here with us today as a shining symbol of the Indian diaspora in the world and as the representative of the two - thirds of the people of Mauritius who are of Indian origin and Mauritius . 
India ' s has a deep and enduring relationship with Mauritius . 
India - Mauritius relations continue to grow on the bedrock of the historical and cultural links between the diaspora and India . 
It is of particular delight that 12th March that is celebrated as the National Day of Mauritius is also the day that marked the beginning of the Dandi March of Mahatma Gandhi . 
Mahatma Gandhi had too made a brief stopover in Mauritius in 1901 on his journey from South Africa to India . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , The Indian diaspora has today grown to an estimated 25 million in as many as 110 nations . 
It is a story of many geographies and many histories . 
The vast and diverse overseas Indian community grew for a variety of reasons attributable mainly to mercantilism , colonialism and globalization . 
The divergent patterns of settlement , the varying degrees of integration with their new homelands and the emergence of new identities and ethos make the Indian Diaspora unique in many respects . 
It epitomises a saga of trials , tribulations and the eventual triumph of the will and hard work . 
There is virtually no field of human endeavour that does not have your imprint . 
The Indian diaspora is present in significant numbers in Canada , Malaysia , Singapore , Mauritius , South Africa , the USA , the UK , the Gulf nations and the countries in the West Indies . 
I am told that in Bahrain , every established business organization in that country has an Indian employee in senior or middle management position . 
Some of the brightest minds from the Indian diaspora have also been able to make their mark in the field of high technology . 
Late Dr . Har Gobind Khorana was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1968 . 
Late Dr . S . Chandrasekhar , was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1983 , has the premier X - ray observatory of NASA named after him and the latest addition to the list is Dr . Venkataraman Ramakrishnan who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry . 
While we celebrate the accomplishments of the diaspora , we should also not forget that many of them are struggling to establish themselves and many are facing hardships . 
Some of them are working as labourers and domestic helps . 
Many of them face difficulties on account of stringent labour laws , difficult working conditions , non - receipt of salaries , premature termination of contracts , change of contractual obligations amongst others . 
Our missions abroad have been working hard to solve many of these problems . 
The diaspora can also lend a helping hand in this regard . 
They too could share information with the various organizations under the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs on the change in laws and conditions of employment and help those in need in times of crisis such as bereavements , etc . 
I have been informed that diaspora organizations specially in the Gulf countries do provide such services . 
Strengthening of such social service and philanthropic organizations may be something that the affluent sections of the diaspora could seriously look at . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , I would also take this opportunity to remind you that India is today a land of immense opportunities . 
t is the third largest economy in the world on the basis of Purchasing Power Parity . It too is the second fastest growing economy after China . 
In six out of the last nine years , our country has managed to grow at a rate above 8 per cent . 
Due to the slowdown in the global economy and other factors , the growth rates have declined , from 8 . 4 per cent in 2010 - 11 to 6 . 5 per cent in 2011 - 12 , and further to 5 . 4 per cent in the first half of 2012 - 13 . 
However , as India ' s economy has demonstrated its ability to weather external shocks in the past , I am hopeful that this resilient character of the economy will help to reverse this short - term deceleration and bring economic growth back to the level of 8 to 9 per cent . 
You too can become partners in the progress of the nation . 
For the accelerated growth of the economy , the investment level has to increase . 
As you all know , the rapid economic growth in India after 2003 - 04 was accompanied by a rise in the investment rate , which has declined after reaching its highest level in 2007 - 08 . 
Thus , a revival of the high investment rate in the country is a must for the economy to regain its 8 per cent plus growth levels . 
You all could help in the process by investing in Indian companies and establishing new ventures . 
The yield of Indian equity markets is amongst the highest in the world and many of the most famous companies have established business here or seeking to do so . 
As the Finance Minister , I had opened the Indian capital market for Qualified Foreign Investors ( QFIs ) . 
Initially , we permitted QFIs to invest in Indian Mutual Funds and on 1st January 2012 , in a far - reaching decision , we opened the doors for them to directly invest in Indian equities . 
Soon thereafter , the Corporate Bond market was opened to QFIs . 
You may , therefore , also like to look at the opportunity that India offers in this regard and take advantage of the high yield that you are likely to get by investing in the Indian capital markets . 
India has also set up a friendly regime to enable Indians abroad to remit money to the country . 
NRIs can deposit money in the country under the Non Resident External Rupee account scheme , Non Resident Ordinary Rupee account scheme and Foreign Currency Non Resident account Banks scheme . 
These schemes have been welcomed by the diaspora that they had deposited close to US $ 67 billion at the end of October 2012 . 
The net private transfers from abroad during the first half of 2012 - 13 was close to US $ 33 billion . 
These figures bear testimony to the fact that Indians abroad find it both emotionally and financially fulfilling to invest in India especially in view of the sound economic fundamentals of the country . 
The theme of this year ' s Pravasi Bharatiya Divas , " Engaging Diaspora : The Indian Growth Story " should explore ways and means to encourage further participation by the diaspora to give additional impetus to India ' s growth story . 
I also wish to see the Indian diaspora as a stronger partner , not only in India ' s economic growth , but also in building India ' s knowledge society , while continuing to engage culturally and emotionally , and serving as the effective ambassadors that they have been for this country . 
I am happy to note that we have created institutions that enable India to interact with its diaspora more comprehensively . 
Since 2006 , the Union Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs has set up institutions like the Overseas Investment Facilitation Centre for enhancing economic engagement with the diaspora , and the India Development Foundation of overseas Indians to channel the philanthropic impulses of overseas Indians . 
The Know India and Scholarship Programmes have been introduced to provide overseas youth of Indian origin exposure to the country ' s culture , heritage and economic growth . 
Overseas Citizenship of India ( OCI ) and Persons of Indian Origin ( PIO ) cards have been introduced to facilitate easy travel to India . 
These are only some of the important measures introduced to strengthen the bonds with overseas Indians . 
There is an important role that each one of you can play in India ' s journey to becoming a strong , just and equitable society and taking its rightful place in the comity of nations . 
I am sure that the various seminars and sessions that you have attended over the last three days would prove useful in many ways . 
Besides giving you more information on the opportunities that India offers you , they would have also given you an insight into the several initiatives that have been taken to ensure social development and inclusive growth in the country . 
With the knowledge and experience you have gained as academics , scholars , scientists , technologists , professionals and businessmen , you can play a decisive role in the development of India . 
I have no doubt that together we will keep our ' tryst with destiny ' . 
I wish you success in all your endeavours and join in celebrating and acknowledging that we are proud of your achievements and the invaluable service that you have rendered India , the nation of your roots . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of The Presentation of Census Medals
It is indeed a privilege for me to be here to present the ‘Census Medals’ and ‘Certificates of honour’ to census functionaries for their extraordinary and meritorious services . 
It was due of the arduous efforts of all those associated with the task of conducting Census 2011 that yet another glorious chapter has been added to the annals of history of this institution . 
India has a long and rich tradition of conducting Census taking . 
The earliest references of census taking in the country are found in Kautilya’s ‘Arthashastra’ ( 321 - 296 BC ) and later in the writings of Abdul Fazl’s in ‘Ain - e - Akbari’ during the days of Emperor Akbar . 
However , the first systematic and modern population Census , in its present scientific form was conducted non - synchronously between 1865 and 1872 in the country . 
The first synchronous census in India was conducted in the Year 1881 . 
The Census 2011 was the fifteenth Census in this series as reckoned from 1872 and the seventh since independence . 
The successful conduct of Census without any break since 1872 makes the Indian census unique and unparalleled in the world . 
Census taking in India is a very challenging task , in view of its multi - ethnic , multi - lingual and multi - cultural society . 
The complexity of the exercise can be visualized from the fact that Census Schedules were canvassed in 16 languages and training given in 18 languages . 
About 5 . 4 million Instruction manuals and 340 million Census Schedules were printed . 2 . 7 million enumerators and supervisors were engaged in the task of Census taking across 35 States , 640 districts , 5924 sub - districts , 7936 towns and 6 . 41 lakh villages ! 
The unique feature of Census 2011 is that Schedules for preparation of National Population Register ( NPR ) were also canvassed along with Houselisting Schedules . 
I congratulate all my countrymen for having cooperated in Census taking . 
Without their active and whole hearted co - operation it would have not been possible to complete this gigantic exercise in a short duration of 21 days . 
I also congratulate the entire Census team for having completed the field work successfully within the stipulated time period and declared the provisional results in a record time of three weeks after completion of the field work . 
India is emerging as a strong , self - reliant and modern nation . 
The basic benchmark statistics on the state of human resources , demography , culture and economic structure thrown by Census 2011 would not only help planners , policy makers and other stakeholders in evaluating the success of on - going schemes but would also assist in formulating future developmental plans . 
Census data are also widely used by national and international agencies , scholars , business persons , institutions and particularly the researchers . 
Informed decision making has to be based on empirical data and census is the only source of data that provides information on various individual characteristics right up to village level for rural areas and ward level for urban areas . 
I hope with the latest technology adopted by Census Organization for data dissemination , Census results would be accessible quickly to all the stakeholders in the remotest corner of the country . 
I am given to understand that it is a tradition to recognize the outstanding work done by Census functionaries after every decennial census . 
Census functionaries toil in the most difficult terrain and adverse conditions to make this mammoth exercise a grand success . 
It gives me great pleasure to award Census Medals and Certificates of honour to Census functionaries in recognition of their outstanding zeal , high quality of work and devotion to duty . 
I congratulate all the Census medal winners and wish them well for the future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of The Release of Commemorative Postage Stamp on ' Silk Letter Movement ' 
It is indeed a happy occasion for me to be present here for the release of a stamp dedicated on ‘Silk Letter Movement’ . 
As we all know , 15th August , 1947 was the culmination of almost two hundred years of resistance , intense political activity , including fasts , marches , protests , agitations and various types of movements . 
As we look back on the epic saga of this struggle , we are struck by the long drawn out and valiant fight put up by people from almost all walks of life without any thought towards their personal comfort and security . 
. It was a widespread movement of multifaceted dimensions . 
In this movement people of various persuasions , following different ideologies , presented a multipronged resistance to foreign rule . 
This unique struggle was marked by a variety of approaches adopted by the people to rid the nation of the foreign domination . 
People who participated in the struggle belonged to various schools of thought and varied outlooks . 
Despite differences in their approaches and the methods of resistance to the foreign rule , they were all united in their desire to secure liberation for their motherland from yoke of colonial rule . 
The Silk Letter Movement was one such effort from a group of revolutionaries . 
This movement was a plan to mobilize the support of the governments of Afghanistan and Turkey in organizing a revolt within India to overthrow the British rule . 
Obaidullah Sindhi and Maulana Mahmood Hasan were two important leaders of this movement . 
In August 1916 , some letters written on silk fell into British hands . 
It is believed that the Silk Letters confiscated by British Government contained details of the Provisional Government of Azad Hind and its plans and a comprehensive scheme of forming an army and getting the support of the Turkish Government . 
The sacrifices of individuals and groups , such as those associated with the Silk Letter Movement , constitute a glorious chapter of India’s history of Freedom struggle and need to be acknowledged and appreciated . 
The stories of struggle need to be told and retold to a young generation born in a free India and enjoying the fruits of liberty . 
I am happy that the Department of Posts has done its bit in this regard . 
Over the years , it has issued postage stamps to acknowledge the contribution of various groups and movements which in their own ways contributed to the overall effort to liberate India . 
. The regular India Postage Stamps were introduced in October 1854 during the tenure of Governor General Lord Dalhousie . 
hese were red lithographed stamps of one anna and blue lithographed stamps of half anna , bearing the portrait of Queen Victoria . 
This symbolism of British Monarchy came to an end with India gaining independence on 15th August , 1947 . It was a proud moment when the greeting " Jai Hind” figured on the first three stamps issued by free India . 
I am told that since then the Department has issued more than three thousand stamps , many of them on great personalities and events which had contributed to the freedom struggle . 
I compliment Shri Kapil Sibal for his endeavour to dedicate stamp on the ‘Silk Letter Movement’ , as it truly reflects the multi - cultural and multi - faceted dimension of the freedom struggle . 
I join you all in paying tribute the efforts and contributions of this great movement . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The International Seminar on Recent Trends in Judicial Reforms : A Global Perspective
I am delighted to be here today on this occasion to inaugurate the International Seminar titled , " Recent Trends in Judicial Reforms : A Global Perspective” . 
The Seminar has been organized by the India International Law Foundation . 
I congratulate the organisers for choosing this theme at a very appropriate time . 
Let me begin by stating the universal rule that there is nothing constant in this world except change . 
The only difference could be the speed at which the wheels of transformation may spin . 
The idea of justice and the manner of its implementation are no exception to this universal rule . 
Judicial reforms should , therefore , be at the centre stage in the fast transforming world in which we live . 
It is imperative for enhancing the quality of justice that is at the core of human existence and welfare of any society . 
It is simply the fundamental goal of all societies . 
This is the reason why the human civilization has been locked in a constant struggle to achieve higher standards of fairness and equity . 
The endeavour is timeless with societies borrowing new practices from each other achieving higher standards of justice and more commonality in laws and procedures in the process . 
The ultimate goal of securing justice is the primary function of any judicial system . 
To accomplish it , the existence of the rule of law is a priority , with the highest standards of transparency , and the deliverance of speedy justice at affordable costs , being the two legs that give life and soul to the precept . 
These are the components that the judiciary should focus on to implement the " justice oriented approach” . Justice delivered with these goals can only live up to the highest standards of the ideal . 
It would , therefore , be necessary to effect organizational and procedural changes in the judiciary from time - to - time to address the exigencies of time . 
Yet the path to achieve it is varied and there is no consensus on the reforms that need to be embraced for it . 
Different stakeholders may accord different priorities to the changes that need to be made . 
The market stakeholders may judge the effectiveness of judicial systems on the basis of speedy settlement of disputes . 
The common man on the other hand may judge the efficacy of the judicial system based on its ability to deliver to them equitable justice in what many call is an inequitable world . 
In the ultimate analysis , however , the efficacy of the judicial system will depend on its capacity to deliver justice to all irrespective of their social or economic standing in the society . 
As India’s Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru stated : " the judiciary performs a social purpose , that is , to bring about justice , to deliver justice to the people . ”
In India , the judiciary has risen to this call departing from its traditional role of only settling disputes . 
Consequently , the role and expectation from the judiciary have also changed to encompass justice in its wider term . 
The assumption of this wider role has at times courted opposition for its deviation from the principles of the separation of powers . 
Yet , some of the positive contributions that such activism have spawned are unquestionable . 
But , I would need to add a cautionary note here - - - the fine balance existing in every democracy with each of the three organs of the state , the legislature , executive and judiciary , playing their designated roles should not be disrupted . 
The three organs should not step into or play the role that the constitution has not assigned them . 
The fundamental principle is contained in the assertion of Charles Montesquieu that there can be " no liberty” when either legislative and executive powers are combined in the same entity or when the judicial powers are not separated from the legislative and executive . 
In India , justice is time consuming and expensive . 
The large pendency of court cases is a cause for concern . 
The total pendency in the Subordinate Courts and High Courts in the end of 2011 calendar year was over 3 . 1 crore cases . 
The pendency in the end of 2012 calendar year in the Supreme Court was over 66 thousand cases . 
Delay further adds to the costs . 
Therefore , in many ways it tantamounts to denying justice and this is against the principle of equality that is the bedrock of democracy . 
The Eighteenth Law Commission had made certain suggestions in this direction . 
Steps to utilize full working hours of the court , more application of technology such that cases with similar points are clubbed for a combined decision , specifying a time limit for oral arguments , time limit for arriving at decision , and curtailing vacancies in the higher judiciary are some of the measures that are worth considering . 
I have full faith in the genius of our Judiciary to find the way forward to effect reforms in the judicial system so as to sustain the faith of the common man in the justice delivery process . 
We must engineer change to reduce the backlog of court cases and the experience of the legal luminaries from around the globe who are present here , may be able to share their experience on how they tackle such issues in their respective countries . 
Worldwide experience reveals that important lessons can be gleaned from experiments conducted in different countries . 
Additionally , there is a constant review of procedure and modification by way of Practice Directions and Practice Notes simplifying rules and forms . 
In our country the Civil Procedure Code has all the ingredients necessary for an expeditious trial but the system requires a change in the mind set of the persons administering it . 
They should have a commitment to speed and expedition . 
Internationally there is complete recognition that management of litigation is a service and not a favour . 
It is accepted that a litigant is entitled to the most appropriate and expeditious means of grievance redressal . 
Today , we live in a world where the traditional notions of state boundaries are fast crumbling . 
Technological advancements have created an interconnected world that has helped virtually unlimited exchange and transmission of information , the conduct of commercial transactions and social networking . 
These developments have thrown up new challenges and opportunities for all the organs of the Government . 
Globalization which is the engine of transformation , demands newer approaches . 
Challenges spawned by globalization are many . 
The difference between overseas and domestic interests is gradually fading , with foreign businesses gaining increasing access to local markets through liberalized trade opportunities , commerce and investment . 
Complex litigations arising out of cross border trade and business transactions are increasingly being brought before courts in different countries . 
Given the complexities of international law , including legal entitlements and implications of multilateral and bilateral treaties and agreements , there is perhaps a growing need to equip our respective national judiciaries to deal with the emerging international legal paradigm more effectively . 
The legal frameworks across nation would have to change to facilitate smooth market transactions , rule of law , promote transparent and predictable outcomes and establish democratic governance structures through such transformation , security and human rights in societies . 
In the light of the far - reaching changes gripping the world , there may be a need to broaden the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice at the Hague beyond those involving trade , business and commerce . 
This is required in the context of disputes that arise on account of transnational commercial operations . 
The need to allow legal professionals to practice without hindrance in all countries needs to be deliberated by the international legal fraternity . 
The need also arises as small developing countries are inadequately equipped due to lack of expertise in the intricacies of world agreements and its dispute settlement mechanisms . 
Judicial reform is a continuous process . 
Through constant consultation among stakeholders consensus can be reached to engender changes . 
I am hopeful that various aspects of judicial reforms would be discussed and argued vigorously , shall I say , as you legal luminaries virtually do for all your waking hours , though for this purpose , it may not be to win over the other . 
I am sure that with your wisdom and experience , you will be able to address several concerns , paving the way for judicial reforms , which would benefit all . 
I wish the organizers success in the conduct of this seminar . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of CII - ITC Sustainability Awards 2012
It gives me a great pleasure to be here with you today , on this auspicious day of Makar Sankranti , for the CII ITC Sustainability Awards 2012 . 
I am thankful to the organizers for providing me the opportunity to be a part of this august gathering comprising of the Captains of Indian Industry . 
It is gratifying to note how the subject of sustainability is rapidly gathering momentum to get mainstream recognition . 
The CII ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development has been at the forefront of creating awareness , promoting leadership and building capacity to enable several Indian businesses to pursue sustainability goals . 
I congratulate the Centre and ITC for promoting this Award for the last seven years . 
The ‘Sustainability movement’ in our country is now coming of age . 
The framework of ‘Triple Bottom Line’ objectives of creating share - holder value , building social and environmental capital promoted by ITC is finding broad - based support . 
I am told that ITC’s Sustainability Vision is implemented through a dedicated social investment programme called , ‘Mission Sunehra Kal’ , aimed at empowering stakeholder communities to conserve and manage their social and environmental capital . 
Other society based initiatives like e - Choupal , Social and Farm Forestry programme have resulted in significant generation of livelihood and natural capital . 
India is today the third largest economy in the world on Purchasing Power Parity basis . 
It is also the second fastest growing economy , with its growth rate second only to China . 
Over the last few decades , our economy has shown a capacity to grow faster . 
The average annual growth rate of 5 . 5 per cent during the Ninth Five Year Plan period increased to 7 . 7 per cent and 7 . 9 per cent during the Tenth and Eleventh Plan periods respectively . 
In six out of the last nine years , the growth rate of our economy had exceeded 8 per cent . 
Due to the slowdown in the global economy and other factors , the growth rate has declined , from 8 . 4 per cent in 2010 - 11 to 6 . 5 per cent in 2011 - 12 , and further to 5 . 4 per cent in the first half of 2012 - 13 . 
On several occasions in the past , our economy has demonstrated its capacity to grow at a healthy rate despite disturbances in the global economy and external sector . 
I hope that we would be successful in overcoming the challenge of reversing this short term deceleration and bring our economy back to the growth levels of 8 to 9 per cent per year . 
The imperative to grow rapidly amidst difficult global circumstances is not the only challenge though . 
As we progress on our chosen path of inclusive growth , we are confronted with a multitude of challenges such as poverty alleviation , mitigation of environmental degradation , response to climate change , increasing competition in international markets , escalation in energy demand , and many more . 
In meeting these challenges , I am sure the Indian industry will prove to be more than able partners . 
Economic growth is no doubt the prime driver of a country’s overall development . 
But the natural ecosystem and the people who make up the society are also vital for nation building . 
Environmental sustainability finds an important place in today’s global discourse on growth and development . 
While ensuring universal access to natural resources , we must also promote its efficient use . 
Most economic activities depend on products and services provided by the ecosystem . 
In order to sustain the pace of economic growth , businesses must be able to operate without compromising the future capacity of the ecosystem . 
Our country is the fourth biggest consumer of energy in the world , after the USA , China and Russia . 
Energy Intensity , a measure of energy efficiency of an economy that indicates the cost of converting energy into GDP , is higher for India than developed nations such as the UK , Germany , Japan and the USA . 
Thus , the high economic growth rate of above 8 per cent per annum that we have envisaged for our country in the next five years could entail significant consumption of energy . 
We must vigorously pursue policies that promote energy efficiency . 
During the Eleventh Plan period , policies to reduce energy have led to savings equivalent to 10 , 836 MW of avoided power generation , which in monetary terms , has resulted in annual savings of about Rs . 3000 crore . 
But much more needs to be done as our journey towards pursuing sustainable development has only begun . 
I expect the private sector to play a major role towards ushering an era of green energy and sustainability . 
The economic prosperity that our country has experienced over the last few decades will mean nothing if , on account of poverty , a significant percentage of our population is not able to participate in its development . 
A poverty ratio of around 30 per cent and illiteracy rate of 26 per cent in our country is simply not acceptable . 
A decisive reduction in poverty will be possible only if there is an expansion in economic opportunities for all sections of the society . 
" Inclusive growth” should not be a mere slogan but a fundamental driving force for sustainable development . 
Today , the notion that development encompasses more than just the single dimension of economic indicators , is gaining ground . 
Historically as well as traditionally , businesses have considered financial gains as the measure of success . 
We need to usher in a culture of social responsibility in the governance of Indian companies . 
Indian business , by integrating social and environmental objectives in their operations , can make a positive contribution for the betterment of our society . 
I am happy to note that our Industry is actively participating in several key areas of development in the country . 
Several businesses are developing and implementing innovative solutions for energy access in rural areas . 
I understand that the organizations being awarded today are actively engaged in working with the local communities , in providing agriculture education to farmers and technical education and skill development to the youth , in nurturing local businesses , in addressing issues such as water scarcity , and in spreading awareness on issues ranging from health to biodiversity conservation . 
This Award function is an excellent platform to recognize the efforts of those corporate organizations which have moulded their business models to accommodate the parameters of sustainability . 
I take this opportunity to commend both CII ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development and ITC for their relentless efforts and support for this novel initiative . 
I congratulate all the winners , who have adopted a difficult path . 
Let me assure you that the path you have chosen is also full of opportunity . 
But to find those opportunities , you have to think , create , and deliver while taking care of our future generations
Recognition helps to bring the issue of sustainability to the centre stage of our attention . 
But what is necessary for our Industry is a belief within them that the compulsion of creating value for a business cannot be separated from our concern for society and environment . 
I appeal to the Indian Industry to be part of this sustainability movement and participate in true nation - building . 
I conclude in the words of Late Prof . C . K . Prahalad who said , " For large companies to be entrepreneurial , they have to create aspirations greater than their resources” . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of The Distribution of Krishi Karman Awards
I am pleased to be here today for distributing the Krishi Karman Awards for the year 2011 - 12 to State Governments for exemplary performance in increasing food grain production . 
It is heartening to note that the record production achieved in 2011 - 12 was substantially broad - based covering over 2 / 3rd of the total cropped area in 18 States of the country . 
This is indeed a unique laudable achievement . 
I congratulate the Union Agriculture Minister Shri Sharad Pawar for taking the initiative for setting up these Awards . 
These have been received enthusiastically by farmers and the State Extension machinery , as reflected in the record food grain production over two consecutive years i . e . 2010 - 11 and 2011 - 12 . 
The achievement is all the more significant considering that a set of new States like Madhya Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand , Tamil Nadu , Nagaland and Manipur have been awarded this year . 
Agriculture is a challenging sector which is critically dependent on climatic factors and availability of natural resources . 
The challenge is accentuated by the continuously rising pressure of demand for food , fodder , fibre , fuel and fertilizer . 
There is greater need today for achieving higher production in an environmentally sustainable manner . 
Under these circumstances , it is to the credit of our scientists and stakeholders , both in the public and private sectors , that better technologies to address the challenges are being developed and innovatively promoted amongst farmers to derive optimal returns from available resources . 
We can meet the Twelfth Plan targets period agricultural growth target of 4 % per annum only through measures such as crop diversification , developing high yielding disease resistant seeds , improvement in water management practices , promotion of balanced use of fertilizers and pesticides etc . 
Further , better and increased use of satellite communication for weather forecasting and effective information dissemination to the farming community would help in preventing crop failure . 
All - round progress in agriculture and allied sectors is a sine qua non for holistic rural development in the country . 
During my tenure as the Union Finance Minister , I had outlined a four - pronged strategy as part of the Union Budget for 2010 - 11 to propel growth in the agriculture sector . 
The four components of the strategy comprised of extending the green revolution to the Eastern region of the country , reducing the significant wastage in storage as well as in the operations of the existing food supply chains , improving credit availability to the farmers and providing further impetus to the development of the food processing sector by making available state - of - the - art infrastructure . 
These strategies have led to positive outcomes and we need to build - on these initiatives to induce further improvements in the agriculture sector . 
We are all aware that a number of issues are confronting farmers especially when the communication revolution is integrating the world into a global village . 
Economies are simultaneously becoming knowledge and capital intensive . 
Our farmers have to quickly adapt in order to cope with the changing times . 
They have to upscale from engaging in agriculture for subsistence to taking up agriculture as a commercial venture . 
With a large number of small and marginal farmers who rank at the bottom of the prosperity pyramid , the task is enormous and would need adequate support from Government . 
Government would simultaneously need to focus on creation of employment opportunities in other sectors to provide income diversification to rural families who today are dependent for their livelihood solely on unviable land holdings . 
Economies of scale through aggregation of produce can be catalysed through creation of additional on - farm and non - farm employment opportunities in rural areas . 
In this regard , it is the collective responsibility of different departments and Ministries in Government of India to work in unison and at a scale that creates the desired impact . 
Agriculture also needs to be given priority access to power , credit , water and fertilizers . 
It is essential to create rural infrastructure in the form of all season roads , multi - mode transportation , quality power supply , transparent markets , thriving financial institutions etc . to ensure remunerative returns to farmers . 
We also need to set up farmer interest groups that link farmers to the markets , reduce information asymmetry and make available both information and effective choices to farmers for supply of inputs and sale of produce . 
It needs no reiteration that food and nutrition security is important for India considering the size of our population and the large number of undernourished and malnourished living in extreme poverty . 
Increased food production would not only give a boost to our efforts for improving access to food for all but would also positively impact household level food availability . 
I once again applaud the efforts of the Agriculture Ministry in instituting the Krishi Karman Awards and congratulate the State Governments for their dedicated , sincere and tireless efforts in achieving a record production of food grains . 
I am confident that these initiatives will make all stakeholders work even more closely towards realising the twin objectives of higher agricultural productivity and more sustained and durable economic growth . 
I once again congratulate and wish all of you success in your endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on 10th Knowledge Millennium Summit
It is my privilege to inaugurate the ASSOCHAM 10th Knowledge Millennium Summit on the theme of " Curing the Incurables : Sharing of Innovations” . 
I congratulate ASSOCHAM for organizing this very timely Summit focusing on the need to scale up innovations in the field of healthcare . 
The Indian subcontinent is home to 16 . 5 % of the world’s population and at any point of time , it is estimated that there are over 2 million people with incurable and other chronic diseases . 
A majority of Indian patients have late - stage incurable diseases ( 75 % to 80 % ) when first diagnosed . 
In recent years cancer killed approximately 5 , 56 , 000 people in India . 
This is predicted to rise by 2030 , to nearly 1 . 5 million deaths annually . 
The silver lining , however , is that the life expectancy is continuously on the rise since past several decades . 
It currently stands at approximately 64 years and is expected to rise even more taking into account the better healthcare facilities that India hopes to deliver in the coming years . 
World Health Organisation ( WHO ) data currently suggest that in India , only 35 % people have access to essential medicines and Health care . 
Costs paid to hospitals , physicians , nursing homes , diagnostic laboratories , pharmacies , medical device manufacturers and other components of the health care system , consumed 14 . 6 % of the GDP of the United States whereas India spent 6 . 1 % of its GDP which is even lower than the global weighted average of 6 . 2 % . 
Therefore , innovative healthcare coverage that assures access to medicines and treatment at affordable prices is an urgent necessity . 
Knowledge is the driver of today ' s world . 
While we stand at the cusp of greatness in several fields on the global platform , our innovation in the field of healthcare and medical sciences is yet to scale the required heights . 
India needs to leap to the frontiers of innovative solutions in health care , discovering new cures , harnessing existing and emerging technologies for affordable healthcare , using our abundant heritage of traditional medicines and exploring new paradigms for preventing disease and creating wellness . 
Health care has always been rich in evidence - based innovations . 
Yet even when such innovations are implemented successfully in one location , they often disseminate slowly . 
Diffusion of innovations is a major challenge in all health care . 
We should conceptualize these innovations and form a brotherhood to collectively analyze these innovations and scale them up so as to reach the un - reached . 
Ensuring universal health care is a major concern of governments the world over and that is true for our country also . 
The rapid growth of high end technologies for diagnosis and treatment , and the fact that people are living longer and are more likely to need health support when they age , has become a challenge . 
This in turn presents opportunities for the medical community , insurers and other service providers . 
Innovative technologies , processes and partnerships forged by the Indian government and private companies have already begun bridging the health care gap . 
The Government is keen to continue to encourage private investment in the healthcare sector and is now developing Public – Private Partnerships i . e . PPP models to improve availability of healthcare services and provide healthcare financing . 
There is also growing interest among foreign players to enter India’s healthcare sector through capital investments , technology tie - ups , and collaborative ventures across various segments , including diagnostics , medical equipment , big hospital chains , education and training . 
Advances are underway on several fronts , from expanding health insurance coverage for the poor and building hospitals in smaller towns , to using technology for safer drinking water and improving treatment outcomes . 
We should take pride in the fact that heart surgeries in India cost less than a tenth of what they would in the United States . 
But there is still no denying that the Healthcare delivery gap is huge in India . 
It is estimated that 64 % of the poorest population in India become indebted every year to pay for the medical care they need . 
85 % of the Indian workforce working in the informal sector do not have any kind of insurance and lack access to effective social protection schemes . 
Newer technologies like Information and Communications Technology ( ICT ) can play a major role in improving health care delivery . 
One solution is telemedicine - the remote diagnosis , monitoring and treatment of patients via videoconferencing or the Internet . 
Provision of universal health care is a matter of faith for the Government . 
The Government is looking to scale up public investment on health from the current level of 1 . 2 % of GDP to 2 . 5 % of GDP by 2017 i . e . the end of 12th Plan and 3 % by 2022 i . e . end of 13th Plan . 
For this , the public health system must be greatly expanded and strengthened across the Nation . 
We need to take health services closer to the homes of the families . 
We need out of the box managerial and administrative reforms in the health departments at the state and central level . 
We need to develop effective models of healthcare for the ever - increasing urban population and at the same time not ignore rural healthcare needs . 
The foundation of India ' s national health system must be strong , sensitive and efficient . 
The challenges that the Indian healthcare sector faces are substantial , but the opportunities equally compelling . 
For companies that view the Indian healthcare sector as a glass half full , the potential is enormous as India is one of the few locations in the world with the latest in healthcare technologies including automation , surgical robotics , modular operating theatres , minimal access surgery systems , telemedicine , radiology , etc . 
To conclude , the time has come for Indian Healthcare System to revolutionize itself and make India self - reliant in its Healthcare requirements . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the 28th Congress of The Asia Pacific Academy of Opthalmology
I am happy to be here today for the inauguration of the 28th Congress of the Asia Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology ( APAO ) . 
I thank the Academy and the All India Ophthalmological Society ( AIOS ) for having invited me to share my views with this galaxy of ophthalmologists who have assembled here from across the world . 
This Congress is being held in India for the second time , after a gap of nearly 28 years . 
That it is being held in India , is the result of the committed effort of the AIOS which has been collaborating closely with the APIO . 
I congratulate them for this effort . 
Ophthalmologists occupy a special status and importance in society . 
You do so by being the doctors of eyes , the critical human organ necessary for the conduct of human affairs and pursuit of quality life . 
According to the ancient Indian scripture , the Vedas , the " Eye is the most important of senses” in our body . 
Recognizing this importance , India , as many of you may already know , has been one of the earliest contributors to its science . 
Sushruta , the father of Indian surgery , who wrote the Sushruta Samhita or compilation of treatments , in 600 BC , had described 76 ocular diseases , including 51 surgical , as well as several ophthalmological surgical instruments and techniques . 
The care for the eye has received focused attention since the beginning of recorded human history because of the debilitating impact blindness can have on individuals , the families to which they belong , their economic well - being , the society and the prosperity of nations . 
It also has very strong linkages with the incidence of poverty , particularly in less developed countries . 
The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) in the Vision 2020 document , had by extrapolating the global data of 1975 , estimated that in 1996 there would have been 45 million blind people and 135 million with low vision . 
The data was further extrapolated and it is now estimated that by 2020 , there would be 76 million blind people indicating that visual impairment would double in the period 1990 - 2020 . 
It has been established that the vast majority of those who are visually impaired reside in developing countries . 
Poverty predisposes an individual to blindness and it increases the economic burden by curtailing employment opportunities and diversion of resources for its treatment . 
Empirical studies show that low incomes not only contribute to higher incidence of blindness but 64 % of the disabled slip into to poverty after the onset of visual impairment . 
Even households that do not suffer impoverishment are three times likely to slip into poverty in the first year of the onset of the impairment in comparison to the households that are not affected . 
The families affected by the disability have a lower probability of escaping the trap of poverty on account of increased expenditure for medical treatment . 
Thus , while poverty causes disability , disability too may cause poverty . 
Consequently , the economic impact on the individuals , or their families and the country as a whole is substantial . 
A study published in 1996 estimated that the cost in terms of annual worldwide productivity on account of blindness was US $ 168 billion . 
Socially , the visually impaired suffer many handicaps . 
It has been reported that more than 50 % of the blind people in impoverished countries felt that their social standing and decision making capabilities had diminished because of the impairment . 
The situation is worse when it comes to women as almost 80 % of them have reported loss of authority within the family because of the impairment . 
The impact of blindness is more debilitating on account of its direct and indirect impact on children . 
Though figures vary , it has been estimated that there are around 1 . 4 million blind children in the world and 1 million of them live in Asia and Africa . 
What is startling is that 60 % of the children die in the first year of blindness . 
It is another sad reality that every minute a child goes blind in the world . 
Besides , in developing countries , even when adults are sightless , children are often responsible for leading the adults . 
Consequently , such children find it difficult to attend school thereby restricting their prospects for education employment opportunities . 
What is particularly disquieting is the conclusion of a University of California , San Francisco , study that about 85 % of all visual impairment and 75 % of blindness in the world could have been either prevented or cured . 
It has particular relevance for the less developed countries as around 90 % of the world’s blind reside in developing countries . 
As stated in the Vision 2020 document of WHO , the problem of blindness can only be combated through increased political commitment , professional commitment , provision of high quality eye care , increasing public awareness and support of non - governmental organizations and private sector . 
The two ophthalmological organizations , the All India Ophthalmological Society and the Asia Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology have done creditable work to fight blindness . 
Individually and collectively , they have promoted better practice , and research and manpower development of ophthalmic sciences in India . 
Several programmes for controlling blindness have been launched in India like the National Programme for Control of Blindness . 
These programmes have yielded appreciable results . 
But , government alone would not be able to combat blindness as effectively as collaborative ventures or the initiatives the two can together forge . 
Private sector companies and government institutions should , therefore , join hands to fight blindness and visual impairment . 
The private sector companies should not consider this a burden but as a way of discharging their social obligations . 
The private sector would also help in increasing their sales and earnings through reduction in the incidence of blindness and poverty and the resulting increase in the prosperity in the society . 
The need for collaborative initiatives is important as even comparatively simple interventions at the appropriate time would help prevent blindness . 
For instance , cataract can be treated by a relatively simple surgery . 
In this effort , individual doctors also can contribute by sparing one or two days in a month for social service . 
With the help of other voluntary organizations , medical teams could travel to the interiors of the country in mobile operation theatres . 
If the local medical associations like the Indian Medical Association can take this initiative in collaboration with the non - governmental organizations in towns and districts , it would make a distinct difference . 
You would agree that while we strive for personal excellence and well being , there can be no greater satisfaction than giving sight to the sightless . 
This is especially true as only 25 % of the blindness in the world and 15 % of all visual impairment are considered unpreventable or incurable . 
I would , therefore , urge you not to count your success in terms of the economic prosperity , but by the number of people who you can help prevent from becoming blind or by giving sight to those who live without it . 
I would , therefore , request you to work through your professional organizations in each of the districts , towns and cities , to achieve this laudable goal . 
I am confident that this Congress , which I am told is being attended by over 9000 delegates from all over the world , will find solutions for providing greater medical access to the needy . 
I also hope that the technical sessions will provide the necessary platform for knowledge sharing and information dissemination . 
I wish the 28th Congress all the success . I also wish All India Ophthalmological Society and Asia Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology all the best for their future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the 15th annual convocation of The Bengal Engineering and Science University , Shibpur
I am very happy to be here with you on the occasion of the 15th Annual Convocation of the Bengal Engineering and Science University , Shibpur . 
This University has come a long way since it was established , in 1856 , with ten students and three faculty members as the Calcutta Engineering College . 
Over the last 157 years , the University has evolved into a leading Institution whose alumni have proven themselves in different fields in India and abroad , bringing laurels not only to themselves but also to this institution . 
I recall with pleasure my last visit here in 2011 when I had inaugurated the ‘Students’ Centre for Creative Expressions’ at Slater Hall , one of the heritage buildings in this campus . 
I had noted then the progress made by this University in education and research , particularly , in the areas of green energy , medical sciences and water technology . 
It is commendable that the University has now taken a lead in initiating undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in strategic areas like Aerospace Technology , Remote Sensing and Material Science & Technology . 
You have equally focused on providing your students the infrastructure and facilities required for excellence and research in these key areas . 
Your work of exploration and discovery in these fields is of great importance for developing advanced technology in our country to meet the priority needs of our people . 
From the Vice Chancellor’s report , I find that the faculty and students of BESU have done well in renewable energy , healthcare , steel technology , transportation , planning and architecture , electronics , mining , water , telecommunication and similar key areas of importance for our nation - building and progress as a knowledge society . 
I note that students of this university have also enthusiastically pursued their interest in diverse areas of creative expressions , such as in dramatics , photography and music – which are so important for a balanced personality . 
Government of India , in recognition of the distinguished service provided by this University in the advancement of education , has decided to convert it to an Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology ( IIEST ) , and recognize it as an ‘Institution of National Importance’ . 
t is a well earned honour which should motivate all of you to excel in both academics and research . 
Quite often , I have observed that there is a deficiency of research manpower in strategic areas like space technology , atomic energy , defence , as well as in basic engineering research in medical technology , and environmental science & technology . 
I would stress that BESU , Shibpur which had once contributed significantly to the development of IIT system in India should now assume the responsibility of ensuring continuous revitalisation of its various Departments and Centres through research and innovation . 
The Ph . D . programme of this University , I understand , has had a fresh enrolment of 235 candidates in 2012 . 
he number of sponsored projects have also multiplied manifold during the last three years and have benefited from increased funding . 
I am told , over 92 research projects have been sponsored and are currently under way having received a financial assistance of over 62 crores . 
I am particularly glad that the subjects of research include safe water and sanitation , development of semi - conductor nano materials , preparation of a Ganga - basin environmental management plan , development of a smart prognostic system of an early indication of cardiac disease . 
These are key areas where the University’s contribution to the development of science and medicine will be invaluable . 
It is apparent that the university has been duly modernising its facilities - but I would emphasise that this process of updating and modernizing must be a continuous one . 
Similarly , students and faculty members must ensure regular interaction and collaboration with counterparts in India and abroad . 
This would , in every way , be an enriching experience - of great benefit not only to yourselves and your institution but it will also be an opportunity to showcase your capacities and talents – even while you take the opportunity to learn from the achievements and best practices of others . 
Similarly , a symbiotic relationship with the industry – wherever there is focus on developing technology and making it consumer friendly would always benefit our people . 
I would like to remind you , as you break the frontiers of science and discover new technology , your efforts would be truly valuable if they bring efficiency to our industry , comfort in the daily lives of our people and wipe the tears of the most challenged of our countrymen . 
It is always a pleasure to be among young people who are ready to step into their most creative years . 
Your energy , your determination and your aspirations at this stage must be channelised to address the problems and challenges that our nation is facing in a result oriented manner . 
I take this opportunity to call upon you all to be proactive in building our society but without forgetting our heritage and tradition of tolerance , mutual respect and an inclusive approach in achieving our developmental goals . 
It is entirely appropriate that the University will , in recognition of the achievements of distinguished physician and medical researcher Dr . M . S . Valiathan , and distinguished academician Dr . B . K . Bose , confer on them the degree of D . Sc ( Honoris Causa ) . 
I am also happy to note that the University will honour eminent classical singer of the Benaras Gharana , Smt . Girija Devi with D . Litt . ( Honoris Causa ) . 
I am reminded on this day of the engineering geniuses that hailed from the State of Bengal , Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose , Mani Lal Bhaumik , Satyendranath Bose , Megh Nad Saha and Prafulla Chandra Roy to name a few . 
I take this opportunity to pay tribute to their legacy and hope that their efforts , achievements and contribution to humanity will inspire you , also , to aspire towards the highest goals . 
I congratulate the Chancellor , Vice Chancellor , faculty members of the BESU University and wish them continued success in developing this University as an institution of excellence . 
With these few words , I offer my felicitations and congratulations to those who have received their degrees and awards today and wish you all every success in your future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the sesquicentennial celebrations of The Calcutta High Court
It gives me great pleasure to be in Kolkata today for the closing ceremony of the Sesquicentennial Celebrations of the High Court of Calcutta . 
It should be recalled that unlike the other High Courts in the country or the Hon ' ble Supreme Court , the three Presidency High Courts at Calcutta , and what were then Bombay and Madras were not brought into existence by the Constitution of India or even any Act of a legislature
The three Presidency High Courts including the High Court at Calcutta were brought into existence by Royal Charter , a Letters Patent , issued by the Queen under her sign manual and privy seal , as authorized by the High Courts Act , 1861 , a colonial legislation . 
The Letters Patent gave the High Courts including the High Court at Calcutta the same power as the High Court in England had , at that time . 
It therefore could do equity and issue writs including those that we have become familiar with under Article 226 of the Constitution of India . 
There was only one limitation before 1950 , that they could not extend to revenue matters . 
The High Court could even issue mandatory orders and preventive injunctions as specific reliefs in properly constituted suits against the government . 
It could and often did adjudicate between man and man and on concepts and on social ills that have had a wide - ranging impact . 
Since independence and the coming into force of the Constitution of India , the Calcutta High Court has strived to secure for our citizens justice - social , economic and political - as enjoined in the preamble to our Constitution . 
The High Court , over the years , has earned fame as an institution of high standards with strong traditions and ideals . 
It’s Bench , as well as Bar , have been well known for its intellectual erudition and legal acumen . Land mark decisions of this Court have contributed greatly to the strengthening of the legal and constitutional framework of our country . 
Illustrious lawyers and Judges of this Court have contributed immensely to nation building and advancement of social justice . 
In general , the Indian judiciary has played a glorious role in national development and in upholding the ideals of the Indian Constitution
As per the Indian Constitution , the State is enjoined with a duty to secure to its citizens a social order , in which the legal system of the nation promotes justice on the basis of equal opportunity . 
The State is also required to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reasons of caste , creed , sex or by reasons of economic or other disabilities . 
Currently , we are a country with a population of nearly 1 . 2 billion . 
For a country of such a large population , the judicial institutions have the unenviable task of delivering timely , affordable and quality justice to all its citizens , regardless of whether they approach the courts for enforcing their civil rights or proving their innocence against charges of criminal misconduct . 
It has to ensure that those who are on the wrong side of the law are dealt with swiftly and effectively to maintain the social order if the confidence and faith of the people of India in the judiciary has to be maintained . 
I have no hesitation in stating today that the Indian judiciary has truly lived up to the faith and confidence of the people by upholding the Rule of Law and enforcing the right to personal liberty and freedom at any cost . 
The judiciary deserves unequivocal recognition for this stellar achievement . 
The independence of the Judiciary is the cornerstone of our democracy . 
Everything necessary needs to be done to preserve and protect the independence of our judiciary . 
But this needs to be done while maintaining the delicate balance of power enshrined in the Constitution . 
It is important that each organ of government operate within its own sphere and none takes over functions assigned to the other . 
While the exercise of powers of the legislature and executive are subject to judicial review , the only check on the judiciary ' s exercise of powers is the self - imposed discipline and self - restraint . 
Legislation which carefully balances the independence of the judiciary with the need to protect and preserve its credibility is a useful complement to the judiciary ' s own efforts . 
We must never forget that it is the Constitution which is supreme and not any one of its creations - the legislature , the executive or the judiciary . 
Our judges , through innovation and judicial activism have contributed enormously to expanding the frontiers of justice and providing access to the poorest of the poor of our country . 
At the same time , the judiciary , as an important pillar of democracy , must also keep reinventing itself through a process of introspection and self - correction . 
In a parliamentary democracy , the greatest challenge to good governance is to bridge the gap between the expectations of the people and the effectiveness of the delivery mechanisms . 
Effective governance requires effective institutions ; and the effectiveness of the institutions – be it the Legislature , the Executive , or the Judiciary – depends on its delivery mechanisms and the framework of supportive rules , regulations and procedures , which need to continuously evolve in response to the changing times and emerging situations . 
Though Indian judiciary has preserved its pre - eminent place in Indian democracy , one area where it has lagged behind is in not being able to fully meet the aspirations of the people and provide quick , speedy and accessible justice to those who knock at its doors . 
Much has been done but that is not enough . 
Our courts need to be urgently strengthened with additional resources . 
The filling of vacancies in courts across the country must be taken up as a priority by all concerned . 
The process of selection and appointment of judges should conform to the highest of standards and should be based on well established and transparent principles . 
The judicial system in our country should not only be accessible but also affordable . 
In order to address time consuming and expensive litigation , alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration should be encouraged . 
Further , there must be adequate provision for free legal aid . 
Greater efforts are also needed to spread legal literacy across the nation and improve the quality of legal education . 
The Government in partnership with the judiciary is undertaking a number of initiatives for speedy delivery of justice . 
Under the eCourts Mission Mode Project more than 11 , 000 district / subordinate Courts have been computerized already . 
The Government hopes to reach the target of 14 , 000 ICT enabled Courts by March 2014 . 
After the Project is complete , case management in the Courts would become automated . 
The Courts will be in a position to provide electronically more than forty services to litigants and other stakeholders . 
As a result , Courts will be in a position to dispense justice faster and quicker . 
ICT enabled Courts will ultimately have to move to the next level and become full - fledged eCourts . 
As Courts of tomorrow , eCourts will have connectivity across police stations , prisons , forensic laboratories , hospitals and will record evidence online . 
The filing of cases will be online and so will be the payment of fees . 
The eCourt records will be all digitalized and judgments of the Courts will become available to the public on a website . 
Another important judicial reform which is under way and being pursued together with judiciary is with regard to court procedures and court processes for speedy disposal of cases . 
The Supreme Court of India has recently notified a National Court Management System for addressing the issues of case management and court management , for setting up measurable standards for the performance of the Courts and for laying down a National System for Judiciary Statistics in the country . 
All this will accelerate the speed of justice delivery and once in place , will facilitate the establishment of a National Arrears Grid ( NAG ) . 
The NAG will in turn be a great tool for monitoring online pendency in each Court and for speedier disposal of old pending cases . 
There are several other initiatives which are also under way to address the problem of pendency and improve the quality of justice . 
A Sub - Group under the Chairmanship of Law Commission has been set up for taking a closer look at reforms in Criminal Justice System . 
The National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms , which has been set up by the Government in 2011 , has already initiated a series of measures for fulfillment of the twin objective of increasing access to justice by reducing delays and arrears in the system for enhancing accountability through structural changes and by setting performance standards and capacities . 
The Mission will also be actively pursuing the measures listed in the Vision Statement 2009 , which has the acceptance of the judiciary . 
I am certain that all these measures which are in the pipeline or are at different stages of implementation , will improve the credibility of the justice system and will bring about greater speed and transparency in dispensation of justice to the people of the country . 
The High Court at Kolkata today has 41 judges , against the sanctioned strength of 58 judges . 
There are 3 . 47 lakh cases pending in the Calcutta High Court as of 31st December 2011 ; more than 3 lakh of them being civil cases . 
The pendency in the subordinate courts under the Calcutta High Court is an estimated 26 lakh and more than 21 lakh of them are criminal cases . 
There is a need to speed up disposal of cases , as justice delayed is justice denied . 
I am sure the Government of India and the State Government of West Bengal will extend all possible support to the Calcutta High Court in its endeavour to reduce this mountain of pendency . 
I am also certain that both Governments are committed to making sure funds will not be a constraint in implementing initiatives to secure greater access to justice for our citizens . 
The Government , judiciary and lawyers must work hand in hand to make our Constitution a living reality for the common man . In our Constitutional set - up , the Judiciary has been accorded a pre - eminent role . 
To quote Justice V . R . Krishna Iyer ' The Judiciary occupies , amongst the trinity , the highest place in people’s conscience and confidence ' . 
I am certain that the Calcutta High Court will continue to uphold its glorious heritage of 150 years . 
It will enhance its contributions to the development of law , justice and jurisprudence . 
It will at the same time ensure that administration of justice continues to be carried on with dedication and commitment to the common man . 
I congratulate the Hon ' ble Judges , members of the Bar and the staff of the Calcutta High Court for their past achievements and wish them the very best in their future endeavours . 
Address by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on The Eve of 64th Republic Day of India
On the eve of our 64th Republic Day , I extend warm greetings to all of you in India and abroad . 
I convey my special greetings to members of our armed forces , paramilitary forces and internal security forces . 
India has changed more in last six decades than in six previous centuries . 
This is neither accidental nor providential ; history shifts its pace when touched by vision . 
The great dream of raising a new India from the ashes of colonialism reached a historic denouement in 1947 ; more important , independence became a turning point for an equally dramatic narrative , nation - building . 
The foundations were laid through our Constitution , adopted on 26 January 1950 , which we celebrate each year as Republic Day . 
Its driving principle was a compact between state and citizen , a powerful public - private partnership nourished by justice , liberty and equality . 
India did not win freedom from the British in order to deny freedom to Indians . 
The Constitution represented a second liberation , this time from the stranglehold of traditional inequity in gender , caste , community , along with other fetters that had chained us for too long . 
This inspired a Cultural Evolution which put Indian society on the track to modernity : 
Society changed in a gradual evolution , for violent revolution is not the Indian way . 
Change across the knotted weaves of the social fabric remains a work in progress , impelled by periodic reform in law and the momentum of popular will . 
In the last six decades there is much that we can be proud of . 
Our economic growth rate has more than tripled . 
The literacy rate has increased by over four times . 
After having attained self sufficiency , now we are net exporters of food - grain . 
Significant reduction in the incidence of poverty has been achieved . 
Among our other major achievements is the drive towards gender equality . 
No one suggested this would be easy . 
The difficulties that accompanied the first quantum leap , the Hindu code bill , enacted in 1955 tell their own story . 
It needed the unflinching commitment of leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Babasaheb Ambedkar to push through this remarkable legislation . 
Jawaharlal Nehru would later describe this as perhaps the most important achievement of his life . 
The time has now come to ensure gender equality for every Indian woman . 
We can neither evade nor abandon this national commitment , for the price of neglect will be high . 
Vested interests do not surrender easily . 
The civil society and the government must work together to fulfill this national goal . 
I speak to you when a grave tragedy has shattered complacency . 
The brutal rape and murder of a young woman , a woman who was symbol of all that new India strives to be , has left our hearts empty and our minds in turmoil . 
We lost more than a valuable life ; we lost a dream . 
If today young Indians feel outraged , can we blame our youth ? 
There is a law of the land . But there is also a higher law . 
The sanctity of a woman is a directive principle of that larger edifice called Indian civilization . 
The Vedas say that there is more than one kind of mother : birth mother , a guru ' s wife , a king ' s wife , a priest ' s wife , she who nurses us , and our motherland . 
Mother is our protection from evil and oppression , our symbol of life and prosperity . 
When we brutalise a woman , we wound the soul of our civilization . 
It is time for the nation to reset its moral compass . 
Nothing should be allowed to spur cynicism , as cynicism is blind to morality . 
We must look deep into our conscience and find out where we have faltered . 
The solutions to problems have to be found through discussion and conciliation of views . 
People must believe that governance is an instrument for good and for that , we must ensure good governance . 
We are on the cusp of another generational change ; the youth of India spread across villages and towns , are in the vanguard of change . 
The future belongs to them . 
They are today troubled by a range of existential doubts . 
Does the system offer due reward for merit ? 
Have the powerful lost their Dharma in pursuit of greed ? 
Has corruption overtaken morality in public life ? 
Does our legislature reflect emerging India or does it need radical reforms ? 
These doubts have to be set at rest . Elected representatives must win back the confidence of the people . 
The anxiety and restlessness of youth has to be channelized towards change with speed , dignity and order . 
The young cannot dream on an empty stomach . 
They must have jobs capable of serving their own as well as the nation ' s ambitions . 
It is true that we have come a long way from 1947 , when our first Budget had a revenue of just over Rs . 171 crore . 
The resource base of the Union government today is an ocean compared to that drop . 
But we must ensure that the fruits of economic growth do not become the monopoly of the privileged at the peak of a pyramid . 
The primary purpose of wealth creation must be to drive out the evil of hunger , deprivation and marginal subsistence from the base of our expanding population . 
Last year has been a testing time for us all . 
As we move ahead on the path of economic reforms , we must remain alive to the persisting problems of market - dependent economies . 
Many rich nations are now trapped by a culture of entitlement without social obligations ; we must avoid this trap . 
The results of our policies should be seen in our villages , farms and factories , schools and hospitals . 
Figures mean nothing to those who do not benefit from them . 
We must act immediately , otherwise the current pockets of conflict , often described as " Naxalite " violence , could acquire far more dangerous dimensions . 
In the recent past , we have seen serious atrocities on the Line of Control on our troops . 
Neighbours may have disagreements ; tension can be a subtext of frontiers . 
But sponsorship of terrorism through non - state actors is a matter of deep concern to the entire nation . 
We believe in peace on the border and are always ready to offer a hand in the hope of friendship
But this hand should not be taken for granted . 
India ' s most impregnable asset is self - belief . Each challenge becomes an opportunity to strengthen our resolve to achieve unprecedented economic growth and social stability . 
Such resolve must be nourished by an avalanche of investment , particularly in better and greater education . 
Education is the ladder that can help those at the bottom to rise to the pinnacles of professional and social status . 
Education is the mantra that can transform our economic fortunes and eliminate the gaps that have made our society unequal . 
So far education has not reached , to the extent desired , to those most in need of this ladder . 
India can double its growth rate by turning today ' s disadvantaged into multiple engines of economic development . 
On our 64th Republic Day , there may be some reason for concern , but none for despair . 
If India has changed more in six decades than six previous centuries , then I promise you that it will change more in the next ten years than in the previous sixty . 
India ' s enduring vitality is at work . 
Even the British sensed that they were leaving a land which was very different from the one they had occupied . 
At the base of the Jaipur Column in Rashtrapati Bhavan there is an inscription : 
In thought faith . . . 
In word wisdom . . . 
In deed courage . . . 
In life service . . . 
So may India be great
The spirit of India is written in stone . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the banquet in honour of The King of Bhutan , His Majesty , Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck
On behalf of the Government and the people of India , it is my privilege to extend to Your Majesties and to your distinguished delegation a very warm welcome . 
We are honoured that you will grace our celebrations on the occasion of India ' s 64th Republic Day . 
. It is indeed a great pleasure to receive you here this evening . 
We warmly recall your State Visit to India in 2011 - soon after the auspicious occasion of your wedding . 
The substantial content and outcome of that visit have been regarded by both our Governments as yet another manifestation of the unique nature of the India - Bhutan relationship . 
Your Majesty , Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck , the Government and the people of India hold you in high esteem and admiration . 
Your sincere and inspiring words to your people at the time of your coronation - that you would protect them as a parent , care for them as a brother and serve them as a son " in the spirit of kindness , justice and equality " , will be remembered for their simplicity and simultaneous grandeur . 
On the completion of five years of Democratic Constitutional Monarchy in Bhutan , please accept , Your Majesty , our felicitations . 
You have guided your people through a period of political transition with prudence and sagacity . 
It is indeed a tribute to Your Majesty ' s leadership that Bhutan has harmoniously embraced and adopted democracy and , in a short time , taken long strides towards progress and prosperity . 
Under your Government , Bhutan ' s GDP has grown at over 8 % annually ; you have brought down unemployment to only 2 % and have achieved close to universal primary school enrolment , access to healthcare , safe drinking water , electricity and other such facilities for your happy people . 
Telecommunication services have reached all corners of your country and a network of motorable roads has been created . 
It is remarkable that while this development has occurred , Bhutan has steadfastly adhered to its constitutionally mandated target of 60 % forest cover , and even expanded it to more than 70 % . 
This balance , Your Majesty , highlights the exemplary manner in which your Government is pursuing its goal of Gross National Happiness , conceived way back in 1972 by your visionary father , His Majesty the Fourth King as a balance between the " fundamental values of Kindness , Equality and Humanity and the necessary pursuit of economic growth . " 
We share your satisfaction at the unanimous recognition of the importance of happiness in the United Nations General Assembly and the declaration of 20th March as the International Day of Happiness . 
We rejoice in the success of this and other initiatives taken by Your Majesty ' s Government . 
Your Majesty , India deeply values and attaches the highest importance to our traditional ties of close friendship with Bhutan , based on utmost sensitivity and respect for each other ' s vital interests and shared perspectives on strategic issues . 
Both our Governments are agreed that our friendship has been constant because of the pillars of trust and understanding on which it is founded . 
We should ensure that these pillars remain strong and unshakable . 
The Government and the people of India consider it a privilege to contribute , sharing our modest resources , to the realization of the Bhutanese way of socio - economic development . 
We should endeavour to strengthen our mechanisms for mutual consultation and co - operation especially in areas of shared interest and common concern . 
Government of India remains committed to further expanding and deepening our multi - faceted , mutually beneficial partnership - in accordance with the hopes and aspirations of the people of our two countries . 
As articulated by our first Prime Minister , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , who laid the foundation of our relationship , India ' s wish is that Bhutan should remain an independent country choosing its own way of life and taking the path of progress according to its will . 
Your Majesty , the well - being , stability and progress of Bhutan are central to our vision for the future . 
It is our firm belief that our exceptionally close and friendly ties will further strengthen in the coming years . 
We repose trust and confidence in Your Majesty ' s wise leadership , as a true " people ' s King " . 
We wish you a long and fruitful reign and the very best of success in your endeavours for the people of Bhutan . 
As Bhutan prepares for its second democratic elections in a few months , the people of India send their good wishes to the people of Bhutan and wish for everlasting peace , prosperity and happiness in the Kingdom of Bhutan , the land blessed by Guru Padmsambhava . 
With these words , Excellencies , ladies and gentlemen , may I now invite you to join me in a toast : - 
- to the health and happiness of Their Majesties the King and Queen of Bhutan ; 
- to the well - being and prosperity of the people of Bhutan ; and
- to abiding friendship and co - operation between India and Bhutan . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of National Conference on Doubling India ' s Food Production in the next five years
It gives me immense pleasure to be here today to inaugurate the National Conference on ‘Doubling India’s Food Production in the Next Five Years’ , being organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Crop Care Federation of India ( CCFI ) . 
I am glad to be a part of this august gathering comprising policy makers , representatives from the agrochemical industry , and eminent intellectuals and scientists . 
In the context of pursuing inclusivity in economic growth , it is of primary essence to achieve the inter - dependent objectives of poverty alleviation , mitigation of food inadequacy , creation of rural employment and growth in rural incomes . 
Substantial expansion in the country’s food production will greatly facilitate in meeting these objectives . 
The subject matter of this Conference is therefore apt and I applaud the efforts of the organizers to bring an issue of topical importance to the forefront of national policy discourse . 
A country’s development is dependent on the productivity of its people . 
Unless the health of our population is secured , we may not be able to realize the progress that we have envisaged for our nation . 
With a growing population , the challenge before us is not only to ensure that the indicators of food security do not deteriorate , but instead show improvement . 
Food production therefore deserves high priority in our national policy formulation . 
Food deprivation cannot be allowed to continue . 
Steps are required to secure for the poor and the needy greater access to food . 
Our democracy is committed to ensuring for its citizens social , economic and political justice . 
We have relied on a rights - based method and empowered our citizens with legal entitlements . 
The landmark Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005 is one such example . 
I am hopeful of the proposed legislation for provision of food security to our people becoming a reality very soon . 
In terms of growth , India’s Agriculture sector has lagged behind the other sectors of the economy . 
The contribution of Agriculture to the country’s national income has therefore declined over time . 
From about 23 per cent during the Ninth Five Year Plan period , the share of this sector has come down to about 15 per cent during the Eleventh Plan period . 
Yet , in a country with one - third of its rural population below poverty line , the potential of the agriculture sector for rural rejuvenation cannot be undermined . 
About a half of our country’s population depends on agriculture for livelihood . 
Some studies have indicated that a one percentage growth in agriculture sector is two to three times more effective in reducing poverty than a one percentage growth in other sectors . 
The growth of the Agriculture and Allied Sectors decreased from 7 . 0 per cent in 2010 - 11 to 2 . 8 per cent in 2011 - 12 , and to 2 . 1 per cent in the first half of the current financial year . 
This deceleration is perhaps reflective of the challenging economic scenario , but I am confident of this situation being reversed quickly . 
Agriculture ought to be an effective agent of change in rural India . 
We have envisaged the agriculture sector to grow at 4 per cent per annum during the Twelfth Five Year Plan . 
The agricultural growth in the Eleventh Plan period was mainly due to improved agricultural prices . 
As demand for major crops are projected to slow down during the Twelfth Plan period , we will have to rely primarily on productivity gains to attain the targeted growth . 
The eastern region of our country is bestowed with abundant natural resources and has the potential to achieve much higher crop productivity . 
At the same time , rice production in agriculturally advanced areas of North - Western India is becoming unsustainable due to over exploitation of natural resources like land and water . 
We have devised a strategy for increasing production and productivity in the Eastern region to ensure food security , while reducing pressure on North - Western region . 
To achieve this objective , a four - pronged strategy was delineated as part of the Union Budget for 2010 - 11 covering agricultural production , reduction in wastage , credit support and thrust to the food processing sector in order to spur inclusive growth , enhance rural incomes and sustain food security . 
As part of the strategy , it was decided to implement ‘Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India’ ( BGREI ) programme under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana in Assam , Bihar , Jharkhand , Eastern Uttar Pradesh , Chhattisgarh , Orissa and West Bengal to address issues of rice based cropping system in these States with an outlay of Rs . 400 crore each in 2010 - 11 and 2011 - 12 and Rs . 1000 crore in 2012 - 13 . 
As a result of these initiatives , farmers in the selected clusters have adopted good agricultural practices like use of drum seeders in direct seeded rice , line sowing , system of rice identification , improved flash flood tolerant and drought tolerant varieties of rice and have gained from the yield advantage of hybrid rice technology . 
I am told that the sustained efforts of the past three years have produced very encouraging outcomes , in terms of significant increase in the share of the Eastern region in the total rice production in the country . 
Of the total rice production of 104 million tonnes in the country in 2011 - 12 , a record production of 55 million tonnes of rice was contributed by the Eastern region . 
I am happy to note that a Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of the Union Agriculture Minister with the Chief Ministers of the ‘Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India’ States to provide fillip to the implementation of the programme . 
I am told that this Committee has decided to focus on procurement of rice during 2012 - 13 , besides ensuring timely availability of credit facilities to poor farmers . 
It is gratifying to know that an Apex Committee on Agriculture for Eastern India has been constituted under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister to provide impetus to the ongoing efforts for agriculture development in that region . 
I am confident that this would provide the line departments such as power , irrigation , finance , fertilizers , marketing and cooperatives a forum to converge their activities in identified clusters so as to achieve integrated delivery of services to the farmers . 
We should place greater emphasis on productivity - driving measures such as diversification of crops , improvement in seed replacement rate , adoption of high yielding hybrid seeds , and improvement in water management practices . 
India is one of the leaders of the information and communication technology revolution . 
We must resort to greater use of satellite communication for weather forecasting and to information technology for its effective dissemination to the farming community . 
In addition to these steps for prevention of crop failure , we must strengthen mechanisms such as agricultural insurance to manage the risk of crop failure due to natural calamities , pests and diseases . 
The Green Revolution in the Sixties brought about a considerable rise in the food production but the disproportionate use of chemical fertilizers eventually led to a decline in food grain productivity . 
The need for balanced use of fertilizers and pesticides should be propagated amongst our farming community through agriculture education and extension programmes . 
The first Green revolution was restricted in terms of geography . 
We should usher in a second Green revolution that is widespread and which touches all arable land in the country . 
The total food grain production of the country increased by 12 million tonnes in 2011 - 12 , from 245 million tonnes in the previous year . 
In 2012 - 13 , the food grain production in the Kharif season is estimated at 117 million tonnes , which is lower than the 130 million tonnes of food grain production in Kharif season in the previous year . 
In the context of the current production levels , doubling food production in the next five years will be a great challenge and test of our capacity to successfully employ all possible growth - inducing measures . 
Quantum jump in food production will have several positive spinoffs . 
It will drive investment in infrastructure for storage , processing , transportation and packaging . 
It will also boost the prospects of the agro - processing industry . 
It will create jobs in the rural sector . 
Better livelihood opportunities in rural areas will reduce the pressure of migration on urban centers . 
Growth in food production will also help in conservation of natural resources . 
With the technologies at our disposal , it will be possible to utilize farm waste from increased food production as feed for livestock and aquaculture . 
This will reduce pressure on forest lands which are currently used as pastures for grazing animals . 
Doubling the country’s food production is an imperative that we cannot ignore . 
It will be possible to arrive at ways and means of achieving this feat only through extensive consultations . 
I congratulate the Ministry of Agriculture and CCFI for providing a platform to facilitate a greater understanding of this issue by all stakeholders concerned . 
I am hopeful of meaningful answers emanating from this deliberation . I wish the organizers every success in conducting this Conference . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of 27th Surajkund International Crafts Mela
It gives me immense pleasure to be here for the opening of the 27th Surajkund International Crafts Mela . 
This event has become an important date in the tourism and cultural calendar of India – and that of well informed tourists all over the world . 
I recall that in 1987 , the Mela was first hosted at a very modest scale - on a small ground of about 3 acres . 
I am indeed happy to see that it has evolved into an international event now – spread over 40 acres with the participation of crafts persons and weavers from all States of India and as many as 20 participant countries . 
I am happy to learn that as per previous attendance , more than a million domestic and foreign visitors are expected to visit the Mela during the next fortnight . 
This will be yet another occasion to showcase India’s treasured diversity – its finest handlooms , handicrafts , fragrances and flavourful cuisine . 
The participation of our friends from a number of countries with whom we have civilisational ties is a symbol of its success . 
The mela has been instrumental , in its own way , in building cultural linkages between communities of craftsmen and artisans in India and abroad . 
This congregation of more than 800 artistes and artisans from the widest range of the folk art and traditions of India affords an excellent opportunity to them display and popularise their products . 
It is an occasion for visitors to enrich their knowledge and understanding of this aspect of the cultural heritage our country , its art and handicrafts exhibited here . 
School children and tourists will have the opportunity to enjoy the vibrant rural ambience and directly interact with these gifted people . 
Thanks to the commitment and dedication of these craftsmen to the preservation of several ancient art forms , several unique traditions are being saved from extinction . 
Our handicrafts and traditional arts represent our Indian way of life . 
The range of our nation’s creativity is as diverse as its colourful people and their crafts . It is an embodiment of our aesthetics and our skilled craftsmanship . 
Our handicrafts and traditional arts are a highly decentralised activity , inspired by the local milieu and , in every case , based on local traditions , using local material and resources . 
These art forms have sustained generations , providing sustainable livelihood and socio - economic development at the grassroots . 
The Indian handicrafts industry has , over the years , contributed significantly to our nation’s foreign exchange earnings . 
During the last decade , each state has seen overall progress in this sector . 
However , despite , the large production base , India’s share in the world handicraft export market is still less than 2 % . 
I am aware that the handicraft sector in India faces a number of threats and challenges which hamper its growth . 
There is a high level of decentralisation , a lack of access to credit , dependence on external factors including middlemen , inadequate raw material input , inadequate infrastructure and out - dated technology , limited access to markets and the biggest challenge is presented by machine - made products which are cheaper imitations but can be mass produced with high economies of scale . 
The export of handicrafts , in addition , has also had to face a slowdown after the 2008 economic crisis . 
Yet , we have many good reasons to focus on this sector , stimulate it and give it a boost . 
There are a number of favourable factors of which we can take advantage – we have an abundant availability of unique raw materials in India - such as bamboo , horn , jute , a pool of skilled artisans and indigenous knowledge , our production costs are generally low and this sector has always been a source of empowerment of women , youth and the disabled . 
Fortunately , due to the policy initiatives of Government of India and various state governments , there has been a growth of approximately 20 % in the export of Indian handicrafts . 
A good sign is that many artisans who had left the sector have begun to revert . 
Governmental interventions to preserve the vitality of this sector have been effective in improving its prospects - through the development of capacity , skills , designs , infrastructure and merchandise . 
It is , however , necessary for Government to be vigilant and stay tuned to the demand in the existing markets in the developed countries as well as in emerging markets in Latin America , North America and Europe . 
It is equally important to address the declining investment in this sector and ensure institutional support - not only with better infrastructure but also supply of good quality raw material , facilitation of transport , access to credit and modern design and marketing mechanism . 
I am happy that the Government of Haryana , in collaboration with several Union Ministries has , year after year , has institutionalised this yearly event . 
This mela has become a sumptuous feast of colour , festivity , a manifestation of our nation’s spirit and pride in its wealth of artistic talent and skills . 
I congratulate Government of Haryana and particularly tourism department of Haryana for organizing this event . 
I would like to also compliment and congratulate the Government of Karnataka for displaying their distinctive cultural and archaeological heritage in such an aesthetic manner . 
I , personally , enjoyed seeing the replicas of the magnificent gates of the Mysore Palace and have always admired the unique architectural styles of Belur , Hampi , the Jain Basadis and Bijapur . 
Other State exhibits , Apna Ghar , and stalls of foreign participants including the SAARC countries and the African Pavilion will , no doubt , enthuse the visitors . 
I do hope that the success of this event will motivate other States of India to organise similar melas . 
I am sure that in the years to come the Surajkund Crafts Mela will continue to attract the best of our proud artisans . 
With these words , I wish the 27th Surajkund International Crafts Mela every success . 
It is my great pleasure to declare this mela open . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of The National Awards for the year 2012 for The Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities
I am delighted to participate in the presentation ceremony of the National Awards for the Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities . 
Today , we honor differently - abled individuals , who by the strength of their indomitable will and their remarkable courage , have many achievements . 
Awards have also been given to Institutions , which have made outstanding contributions to the empowerment of persons with disabilities . 
Their work is exemplary and shows sensitivity to the needs of fellow human beings . 
This is an occasion to acknowledge the dignity and rights of Persons with Disabilities ( PwDs ) and to re - dedicate ourselves to their empowerment . 
Persons with disabilities , often face barriers for participating in all aspects of society . 
These barriers can take a variety of forms ; those relating to physical environment or access to information , or those resulting from legislation or policy or from societal attitudes or discrimination . 
The result is that persons with disabilities do not have equal access in society to services , including education , employment , health care , transportation , political participation or at times justice . 
Experience shows that when these barriers to their inclusion are removed , persons with disabilities participate fully in societal life and the entire community benefits . 
Barriers faced by persons with disabilities are , therefore , a detriment to society as a whole and reasonable accommodation is necessary to achieve progress and development for all . 
We , as a nation , are committed to the full empowerment of persons with disabilities . 
The signing and ratification by India of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ( UNCRPD ) , which came into effect in May 2008 , symbolizes our resolve to move forward on the agenda to provide differently - abled citizens of our country with an environment for their full development and equal participation in the life of the nation . 
The Persons with Disabilities ( Equal Opportunities , Protection of Rights & Full Participation ) Act of 1995 , is our main legislation dealing with persons with disabilities . 
The Government is in the process of replacing it with a more comprehensive new Legislation in consonance with the UNCRPD . 
I understand that this is a holistic piece of legislation which would entail major responsibilities not merely on the Central Government , but also on State Governments , local bodies , and even private service providers . 
I , therefore , urge the Government to complete the remaining stages of consultation expeditiously , and to introduce the Bill in Parliament as early as possible . 
As policy framework is strengthened , we must reinforce our efforts to have better delivery mechanisms for implementation of schemes and programmes , including through effective partnerships with the private sector and civil society . 
Effective delivery can be the only way in which we can see smiles on the faces of those affected by disabilities . 
I am happy to note that Government has created a separate Department of Disability Affairs last year . 
I wish the new department all success . 
I urge all State Governments to have a similar arrangement in order to give more focus to the issues confronting persons with disabilities . 
I also call upon the connected Union Ministries of Social Justice & Empowerment , Women and Child Development , Human Resource Development , Health and Family Welfare , Labour & Employment , etc . to work in unison to achieve the desired results . 
Persons with Disabilities must be enabled through education to get adequate opportunities for gainful employment and their rightful status in society . 
While the goal of inclusive and universal education is being pursued under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan , there is also a need to ensure that children with special needs have access to education , by providing the right kind of teaching - learning environment , material in accessible format and barrier - free educational institutions . 
There is , therefore , an urgent need to train teachers in adequate numbers to provide education to children with disabilities . 
We need to remove physical barriers that do not allow persons with disabilities to have access to various facilities and services . 
Various assistive devices are needed to enable persons with disabilities to lead their lives with independence . 
Simple aids like hearing devices , limb prosthesis , wheelchairs and Braille writing equipment facilitate mobility and communication , and substantially improve functional capacity . 
It is essential to make aids and computer software and accessories available to all persons with disabilities at a reasonable cost , so that they have equal opportunity for enhancement and actualization of their inherent potential . 
Given the widespread and growing use of the internet in various aspects of life , it is vital that at least all Govt . and public sector websites are made universally accessible . 
Economic empowerment of persons with disabilities needs focused attention . 
Government is mandated to provide reservation in employment to persons with disabilities . 
All Central Government Ministries and organizations under their control must take immediate and comprehensive steps to ensure that reservation for this category is effectively implemented in letter and spirit . 
Backlog of vacancies in all establishments in the Government Sector should be filled as early as possible . 
I also request the private sector to employ more and more persons with disabilities in their establishments and industries . 
I am happy that today we are awarding employers of persons with disabilities . 
This shows that private sector can also play a commendable role in appreciating their special abilities . 
There is a need to provide training to persons with disabilities so that they can acquire appropriate skills . 
The government as well as public and private sectors should work hand in hand to improve skill levels of persons with disabilities , thereby enhancing their employability . 
I am informed that a large number of States have not yet appointed full - time independent State Commissioners for Persons with Disabilities though this ombudsman institution is an integral part of the existing Persons with Disabilities Act and such a mechanism is also envisaged in the UNCRPD . 
I urge State Governments to appoint full - time independent State Commissioners for Persons with Disabilities at the earliest possible and to equip them with the wherewithal to function effectively for grievance redressal of the persons with disabilities . 
For many children , the presence of an impairment leads to lack of participation in activities that are part of a normal childhood . 
Women with disabilities are doubly disadvantaged on account of their gender as well as disability . 
Elderly persons with disability , in the twilight of their lives , are likely to be neglected and exploited . 
They need special consideration . 
While addressing the needs of those with disabilities , it is important that attention should also be on preventive measures . 
The possibilities of children in the 0 to 6 age group being afflicted by conditions that can lead to disabilities , can be reduced by precautionary measures such as immunization at the right age , control of diseases and infections , improvement of hygiene , better nutrition and better access to healthcare . 
Government anganwadi workers should be specially sensitized and trained to identify children with disabilities to facilitate earliest possible intervention . 
In conclusion , I congratulate the awardees and convey my best wishes to them for the future . 
My special good wishes to those awardees with disabilities – your awards make us all proud as you represent the spirit of hope , so essential for any society to progress . 
I hope you will inspire many more to come forward and work tirelessly in the cause of disability . 
Also award winning institutions have demonstrated dedication and commitment and their example will certainly encourage others to come forward to work tirelessly in our effort to make our society more disabled friendly . 
Let us all , on this occasion , pledge to do our best for the empowerment of persons with disabilities . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of National Conference on Green Design
I am indeed happy to be present this morning at the opening of the 4th GRIHA National Conference on Green Design today . 
The continuing increase in the Indian population and growth of the Indian economy , along with rapid urbanization has led to an enormous demand for buildings . 
This in turn is leading to a huge increase in demand for electricity in new and existing buildings . 
Simultaneously , the diminishing availability of water is becoming a serious challenge . 
Buildings consume a substantial amount of energy . 
In 2011 - 12 the share of construction sector in GDP was about 7 . 8 % . 
However , the share of electricity consumption by the buildings sector alone is about 35 % of the total electricity consumption in India . 
As per reports of the Planning Commission , the energy supply must grow at a rate between 6 . 5 per cent and 7 per cent per annum in order to meet the 9 per cent growth rate ( during the Twelfth Five Year Plan ) of the Indian economy . 
This means that India would need to add about 76000 MW capacity of power ( approximately 15000 MW power capacity per year ) through the Twelfth Five Year Plan . 
his is not an easy task . Hence , it is essential that demand management becomes a priority . 
Therefore , increased energy efficiency in the building sector and utilization of renewable energy are key strategies to contain this form of growing energy demand . 
To achieve sustainability , the policy makers at all levels need to address the environmental pressures due to increased demand for resources , and a rapidly changing climate . 
Several policy and regulatory mechanisms have been devised to address the urban challenges , and are being implemented through national plans and programmes . 
The Environmental Clearance process is in place to ensure efficiency in resource use for large projects . 
The Energy Conservation Building Code ( ECBC ) is also applicable to air conditioned commercial buildings with connected load more than 100 kW and the Solar Buildings Programme for Energy Efficient Buildings has been formulated for implementation by the designated State agencies and municipal bodies . 
However , much more needs to be done in this regard . 
A perceived notion of high costs of green buildings , lack of clarity in the domain of application , deficiencies in the area of integration and uniformity of various codes and standards , lack of disincentives for non - compliance , agencies and systems working in silos have added to the impediments in the implementation of sustainable habitats . 
Lack of awareness about the expected gains is also a major obstacle while ensuring large scale implementation of sustainable habitats . 
It is heartening to know that GRIHA is addressing these issues and gaps to a large extent . 
It is imperative that in the light of looming challenges of water and electricity availability , States where a significant part of construction is yet to take place should ensure construction of sustainable habitats . 
All Central Ministries need to promote this in their respective sectors . Adoption of GRIHA by the Central Public Works Department ( CPWD ) and the National Building Construction Corporation Ltd . ( NBCC ) should give a fillip to both the public and private sector to construct environment friendly buildings in a big way . 
The urban bodies must also make certain aspects compulsory while introducing a set of incentives and disincentives so that developers fall in line and the bigger houses and complexes also follow this approach . 
I congratulate The Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ) and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy ( MNRE ) , Government of India on the development and implementation of GRIHA - the indigenous green building rating system of India . 
I also congratulate all the recipients of the GRIHA awards for demonstrating environmental responsiveness , energy efficiency and for making significant efforts to adopt renewable energy integration in their respective buildings . 
I hope others would emulate and benefit from the examples set through these buildings . 
I extend my best wishes for the success of this Conference and hope that the deliberations which will take place here , promote creation of sustainable habitats all over the country , the GRIHA way . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the banquet in honour of The President of The Republic of France , H . E . Mr . Francois Hollande
It is indeed a great pleasure to welcome Your Excellency and Madame Valerie Trierweiler on your first State Visit to India . 
Our Government is particularly honoured that you have chosen India as the first country in Asia for such a visit . 
It is a matter of satisfaction that your delegation includes several distinguished Ministers of your Cabinet . 
Your visit to India is yet another occasion to celebrate the high level of understanding between India and France . 
We have long nurtured a close and substantive relationship based on shared principles and values – and our many convergences on regional and global issues of common concern . 
It has thrived on our mutual respect , regular dialogue and constructive exchanges . 
In the people to people context , we have a unique history . 
Indians have sacrificed their lives alongside French soldiers in some of the fiercest fighting on French soil during the First World War and in other theatres during the Second . 
The people of India have held France in great esteem . 
We have admired her open society and its rich legacy of artistic expression , literature and philosophy . 
We recall the visit of Swami Vivekananda to Paris in 1900 and Nobel Laureate , Rabindranath Tagore’s close relationship with French scholars and artists which contributed to the realisation of the cherished Vishwa Bharath University at Shanti Niketan . 
The writings of Rene Descartes found resonance in the works of our own great philosophers ; and Nobel Laureate , Romain Rolland , who published his conversations with Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi , was strongly influenced by our philosophy of Vedanta . 
The slogans of the French Revolution , " Liberty , Equality and Fraternity” were embraced by the framers of the Indian Constitution . 
When the 1954 Agreement was signed between our Governments on the French Establishments in India , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , India’s first Prime Minister had rightly anticipated that the revised arrangement would give birth to a new closeness between our two countries . 
True to his prophetic words , our enduring friendship , marked by our bilateral co - operation in diverse sectors has had rewarding outcomes to our mutual benefit . 
As a result we have , today , more than 700 French enterprises invested in India ; and Indian companies are increasingly exploring opportunities in France . 
Our bilateral trade has grown to almost 9 billion US Dollars in 2011 - 12 and France is today the 9th largest foreign investor in India . 
Our joint initiatives which include technology transfer and collaborative development in the strategic areas of space , defence production and civil nuclear co - operation have been particularly successful . 
We very much appreciate that France has been one of India’s oldest , closest and most reliable partners . 
ISRO’s launch in October 2011 , of the Megha Tropiques research satellite jointly developed by ISRO and the French Space Agency has facilitated the harvesting of valuable data for understanding weather – which is of tremendous worth to both our countries as well as scientists around the world . 
We have a long standing and fruitful collaboration in the railways sector . 
The Indo French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research , has set an example that other countries seek to emulate . 
Excellency , the success of our joint efforts reminds us that India and France have similar aspirations . 
While preserving the advantages of globalization , we are both committed to working bilaterally and multilaterally to shape a new global agenda for inclusive growth . 
We both agree on the need to revitalise global governance and the reform of its principal organs . 
I take this opportunity to reiterate that India appreciates the support consistently extended by France to India’s rightful claim to a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council . 
India desires to see that her external environment is secure so that our country can develop in peace
We are concerned when there is instability in our region ; and we value constructive consultations with all concerned on the issues that must be addressed carefully . 
The sea lanes in the Indian Ocean , similarly , are threatened by acts of piracy , evoking the necessity of closer co - ordination in maritime security . 
As countries that have repeatedly experienced terrorist attacks , we must give due priority to addressing the threats to international peace and security posed by terrorists and their facilitators . 
Excellency , one of the happiest elements in the everyday contacts between our people is the spontaneous current of cultural exchanges between them - even beyond our official programmes . 
‘Namaste France’ and ‘Bonjour India’ Festivals have set a new paradigm of expectations and this year , both Governments will jointly bring out Bonjour India 2013 . 
I have no doubt that under your leadership , our strategic partnership will continue to progress and mature in the years to come . 
With these words , I once again welcome Your Excellency , President Hollande , Madame Valerie Trierweiler and your distinguished delegation . 
I invite you to please join me in raising a toast : 
- To the good health and personal well - being of President Francois Hollande and Madame Valerie Trierweiler ; 
- To the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of France ; and
- To lasting friendship between India and France . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of inauguration of The Twentieth International Engineering and Technology Fair
It is indeed a happy occasion for me to join you at the Inaugural Ceremony of the twentieth edition of the biennial International Engineering and Technology Fair ( IETF ) , being organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry ( CII ) 
Over the last four decades , IETF has transformed from being a small event for the engineering industry to one of the largest and most prestigious exhibitions in Asia . 
I commend CII for guiding the course of this event , which has helped position India firmly on the global engineering map . 
With participation by over 350 national and international companies and conduct of 10 sector - focused fairs in this edition of IETF , I am confident that it will continue to build strategic business partnership , drive innovation and create synergy . 
I am happy to note that Republic of Korea is the partner country for this edition . India and Republic of Korea enjoy close and warm relations that extend to multiple dimensions . 
Economic and commercial cooperation between our countries is strong given that leading Korean companies are major participants in our economy . 
Korean companies have built immense brand recall in the Indian market for the high quality and standards of their products . 
I am told that 72 Korean companies are participating in this exhibition to showcase products from a range of sectors such as tools and machinery , chemicals and transport . 
It is gratifying to know that China is the focus country in this event . 
China’s prowess in engineering and technology is well - known and its participation will only strengthen the linkages between Indian and Chinese engineering enterprises . 
The IETF has been organized at a time when the world is beginning to emerge from the second - round impact of the global economic crisis . 
India too has felt the repercussions of global slowdown . 
Though our economic growth has recently declined somewhat , I am confident that we will be able to bring the deceleration to a halt and revert to the 8 per cent plus growth levels that we attained many times in the past . 
The underlying growth impetus remains strong due to continued rise in per capita incomes , expanding middle - class consumers and a young and energetic workforce . 
I believe that stronger efforts from all stakeholders collectively can build on this trend to secure a faster growth as the global economy revives . 
Engineering is among India’s leading manufacturing sectors . 
It draws sustenance from India’s formidable base of heavy and capital goods industries , a large knowledge pool , and competitive cost structures . 
Our thrust on infrastructure development and industrial production provide further fillip to the sector , creating high demand for products across the engineering spectrum from machinery and automotives to power equipment , electronics , and advanced manufacturing . 
India’s engineering industry has been driven by inter - sectoral linkages and proactive government policies . 
Special initiatives have been taken to support key sub - sectors , with policies dedicated to automotives , electronics , chemicals and petrochemicals , and heavy machinery , among others . 
Clusters and growth corridors across the country facilitate competitiveness as centers such as Pune , Chennai and Bengaluru have attained global acclaim for their high quality products . 
India enjoys strong competencies in engineering , with advantages in design , new product development and time - to - market capacities . 
As services input for manufacturing industries expand , India with its capabilities in services sector can play a bigger role in knowledge inputs for the engineering industry . 
A large number of global firms are already taking advantage of these benefits by establishing their research and development centers in India . 
Through the National Manufacturing Policy 2011 , the government has initiated an umbrella mechanism to promote manufacturing industries under dedicated National Investment and Manufacturing Zones . 
These Zones would bring together state - of - the - art infrastructure , latest technology , skill development facilities , and rapid connectivity to emerge as hubs of manufacturing growth . 
Large amount of investment is envisaged in key sectors such as power , transportation and urban development , a considerable portion of which is expected to come from the private sector . 
This will create opportunity for businesses operating in the engineering sector . 
For that , companies would need to address productivity and competitiveness . 
I strongly believe that there is another milestone to be crossed in the quality and productivity journey . 
New operating models would need to be considered such as flexible automation , multi - location production , deferred customization and disposable factories . 
People should be at the heart of the engineering effort , reaching out to human resources , consumers and vendors . 
The contribution of manufacturing to total employment in India is about 11 per cent , which is lower than that of the emerging countries where the share of manufacturing in total employment is between 15 to 30 per cent . 
The National Manufacturing Policy , 2011 has envisaged the creation of 100 million additional jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2025 . 
To make Indian Industry productive and competitive , we must enhance our capabilities on many fronts , primarily human skill , hardware technology , and knowledge base . 
Innovation is a key managerial strategy for growth . 
We must lay emphasis on its various dimensions such as process innovation , product innovation , business model innovation and new technology innovation . 
Strong capabilities in designing and building machine tools are particularly critical . 
Industry must also develop close partnerships with universities and research institutions to take this aspiration forward . 
A sustainable development model is not only an imperative today but is also opening new opportunities for the industrial sector . 
Indian Industry should focus on reducing carbon footprint and devising green technologies . 
Solar energy and other renewable energy markets are expected to grow strongly . 
Opportunities in green products such as green buildings , bio fuels , and green technologies such as nanotechnology and artificial intelligence should be explored . 
The Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSME ) sector has come to occupy an important position in our economy . 
It contributes about 45 per cent of the manufacturing output and about 40 per cent of total exports of our country . 
In over 29 million MSME units , about 69 million persons are employed . 
A dynamic entrepreneurship is providing a new energy and drive to the MSME sector . 
We need to strongly support engineering MSME units which are seedbeds of innovation . 
Their rising participation in the engineering value chain would impart a new dynamism to the engineering sector . 
I am told that the IETF has dedicated platforms for showcasing technologies and advances in these sectors . 
I look forward to seeing some of the exciting new technologies and products on display . 
Let me conclude by again congratulating CII for organizing this event , bringing the engineering world together with the Indian industry . 
I wish you all a very productive participation . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee delivering The First N . K . P Salve Memorial Lecture on " Constitution and Governance " 
It is indeed a matter of pleasure to join you for the first memorial lecture of Late Shri . Salve who was a multi - dimensional personality . 
I am happy to be here to deliver the First Memorial Lecture of Late N . K . P . Salve on Constitution and Governance . 
The defining feature of any democracy is that it replaces the rule of men by the rule of law and achieves this by creating institutions of governance and processes for their functioning . 
The challenges of governance are always enormous . 
It is more so , in a country that has 17 . 5 % of the world ' s population but only 2 . 4 per cent of land resources and 4 . 2 % of world ' s natural resources with a society which is multi - cultural , multi - lingual and multi religious . 
The challenges are compounded by development issues faced by around 355 million people living in poverty line . 
From the time of its birth , India has continued to face the challenges of poverty and development . 
To meet these challenges , the institutions have to adapt and adopt new strategies and must redefine themselves from time to time . 
There is therefore a need for discussion and debate about the functioning of our Constitutional institutions , to measure their growth and to judge their performance with a view to strengthening them . 
By our Constitution , we resolved to give to ourselves a Republic . 
Our Constitution recognized individual rights and community rights and gave them primacy by calling them fundamental rights , making them enforceable and giving power to our courts to act as a bulwark against any attempt to restrict or curb them . 
Our founding fathers were not unaware of the potential conflict between the Judiciary and Executive and Legislature or either one , but they had faith in the power of public opinion - the ultimate symbol of political sovereignty . 
They knew that the different wings of government would learn to co - exist and work together for the benefit of the nation and its people . 
Our Constitution spells out the aspirations of the founding fathers . 
The guidance for the government , in the form of Directive Principles of the State Policy , is contained in Part - IV of the Constitution . 
The relationship between these principles of state policy and the fundamental rights of citizens was fashioned upon an article of faith of the founding fathers - - that even the most desirable ends should only be achieved through permissible means . 
Our Constitution created three wings of the state : the legislature to make the laws and hold the executive to account ; the executive to govern this vast nation ; and the judiciary to ensure that all institutions stayed within their constitutional remit and to ensure that none tramples upon the constitutional rights guaranteed to the people . 
A written instrument even as elaborate and lengthy as the Indian Constitution is never exhaustive . 
A constitution is a charter for the governance of a nation and its jurisprudence is dynamic and constantly evolving . 
The notion of what is good governance must be defined by the need of the times and enriched by the experience of the decades . 
Yet , it enshrines certain timeless values that can never be compromised . 
It is our duty to identify these values and to measure our performance on the touchstone of these values . 
The Preamble records the resolve of the people of India to be secular . 
It records the resolve to secure to all citizens justice , liberty , equality and fraternity . 
How far have we achieved these and what is the task ahead ? 
It can be said with some sense of satisfaction that despite the challenges we have faced , India continues to remain firmly rooted to secularism . 
The idea of what are the contours of secularism at its fringes is debated - as it must be in any vibrant society - but the basic principles of equality of all religions , the right to freedom of thought and conscience and the right to practice and profess religion and to establish institutions of choice have been steadfastly observed in this country . 
There have been aberrations and every communal conflict , irrespective of its magnitude , scars the conscience of our nation . 
The problem is now exacerbated by terrorism that professes religious underpinnings . 
The challenge of any democracy is to adhere to basic values of civilized behavior and respect human rights and civil liberties in the face of provocation . 
Justice - social , economic and political - is in the life of any nation , a journey more than a destination . 
There have been measures of social justice which over the decades have slowly but surely shown results . 
Abolition of untouchability is one such measure . 
However , much needs to be done to achieve greater social justice , particularly gender justice . 
To achieve social justice requires not mere governance but the transformation of social ethos , a recasting of mindsets and that is the job not just of the legislature , the executive or the courts , but of each one of us . 
Political justice is one of the fronts in which we can look back with a degree of satisfaction . 
Political justice is one of the fronts in which we can look back with a degree of satisfaction . 
The ultimate goal of any democracy is the empowerment of the individual , irrespective of his economic , religious or social standing
This may appear to be a utopian dream for many , but the strength of a system lies in its capacity to ceaselessly work for its accomplishment . 
We owe ourselves to create a system in which access to politics is not limited to a privileged few but an average Indian also feels empowered enough to contribute . 
We have achieved this in some measure though . 
Some of our finest public figures have had humble beginnings and demonstrate how perseverance and determination triumph adversity . 
Economic development is vital to good governance . 
We cannot distribute the wealth which we do not possess and therefore production of wealth must necessarily be one of the predominant objectives of state policy . 
However , this again must be imbued with the principle of equality with which there can be no compromise . 
An egalitarian society can only be created when growth is inclusive . 
It is important to ensure that there is justice and equality of opportunity and the state does not create conditions in which the privileged few gain at the cost of the multitudes who suffer endemic poverty . 
A sustainable society can only be based on the principles of egalitarianism . 
The wisdom of the founding fathers in creating a quasi - federal structure despite providing for Westminster form of democracy requires to be recognized . 
We have achieved a significant degree of federalism , the living proof of this success being the political reality that aspirations of regional parties are finding a due place in government formation at the Centre . 
The Constitutional machinery of dispute resolution is a measure of last resort . 
Adjudicative resolution of complex federal problems is never satisfactory . 
There is no substitute for statesmanship and good sense . 
Problems of governance reflected in disputes of these kinds must be resolved by rising above partisan political interest in a spirit of nationalism and in true adherence to the principles that democracy is about sharing and sharing alike . 
India is not high on the world governance index . 
Though today India is the third largest economy in PPP terms , it is ranked very low in Regulatory Quality and Control of Corruption index . 
This would need to change . We cannot achieve true progress unless the governance improves . 
Not one section is responsible for the ills . 
The society on the whole has to reset its moral compass . 
Amongst the institutions which occupy in public perception a pride of place , is the Indian judiciary . 
True to the dream of the founding fathers , the judiciary is fiercely independent and has always acted as a check upon any Constitutional aberration . 
Of late , the judiciary has been perceived to have assumed an expanded role . 
Some of this is the inevitable consequence of the innovative interpretation of rights , civil and political , enshrined in the Constitution . 
As is inevitable , the Courts at times are perceived as having strayed into areas which are best left to the executive government or to the policy makers in the legislature . 
The separation of powers is a Constitutional feature over which there has never been any doubt , and should be respected at all times . 
We are having this liberty in order to reform our social system , which is full of inequality , discrimination and other things , which conflict with our fundamental rights . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of The Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace , Disarmament and Development for 2011 to Ms . Ela Ramesh Bhatt of Sewa
I consider it a great privilege to present the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace , Disarmament and Development for the year 2011 to Ms . Ela Ramesh Bhatt . 
Whose exemplary work towards emancipation of poor rural women in India has become a model for making grass root democracy possible . 
This prize , instituted in the name of our former Prime Minister , Late Shrimati Indira Gandhi , celebrates the values that she stood and fought for in the service of our nation and its people . 
She was a true leader of the people , who championed the cause of the poor and the deprived and who tirelessly pursued peace and universal disarmament for the betterment of human society . 
Every year , we recognize serious , creative efforts by individual or an entity for working towards the ideals that Shrimati Indira Gandhi embodied . 
Shrimati Indira Gandhi believed that human beings have a collective destiny , and hence , it is their duty to work jointly to establish and maintain peace in the world . 
She adhered to a positive notion of peace that entailed a strong conviction to human welfare . 
Peace and development are intrinsically linked to one another . 
Unless progress touches all sections of society , peace will not only be fragile but also lead to tensions that result inevitably in dangerous manifestations . 
Shrimati Gandhi was unflinching in her concern for the poor and the disadvantaged . 
The call for ‘Growth with Social Justice’ underlined her dedication to create systems and institutions to enable the benefits of development reach all sections of the society equitably . 
Rural backwardness , can be addressed only through concerted efforts to create equality in access and unearth the potentialities hidden in people . 
Ms . Ela Bhatt’s work has underscored this approach to socio - economic upliftment . 
Ms . Bhatt created the Self Employed Women’s Association ( SEWA ) in 1972 , which has a membership in excess of 1 . 3 million . 
She also founded the SEWA Cooperative Bank in 1974 , which has an outreach of 3 million women . 
These simple figures speak volumes of the dedicated efforts of Ms . Bhatt and her team in successfully bringing women out of poverty into a life of self - confidence and esteem . 
If women are under represented in the productive efforts of our economy , it is not only injudicious but also detrimental to the cause of social progress . 
Due to the untiring efforts of Ms . Bhatt , SEWA has become an effective vehicle for promotion of self employment and self reliance amongst women . 
To realize these goals , the organization has been providing support services in the areas of savings and credit , health care , child care , legal aid , insurance , capacity building and communication . 
It has become a multi - dimensional entity - a labour collective , a co - operative and a women’s movement . 
Ms . Bhatt’s work extends beyond the shores of the country . 
She is credited with playing an important role in the formation of several international initiatives aimed at collective progress through social mobilization . 
She has founded and chaired the Women’s World Banking , International Alliance of Home - based Workers , International Alliance of Street Vendors and a global network aimed at improving the status of poor working women , called ‘Women in Informal Employment : Globalizing , Organizing’ . 
Women comprise 48 . 5 per cent of our total population . 
Though the overall sex ratio has increased by 7 during the decade 2001 to 2011 , the ratio of 940 females per 1000 male population in 2011 is disappointing figure and reflects the distance that remains in achieving true equality . 
The literacy rate amongst women has increased from 53 . 7 per cent in 2001 to 65 . 5 per cent in 2011 . 
However female literacy still lags behind male literacy by 16 . 7 per cent . 
Surveys have indicated that the female hourly wage rates in agriculture also vary from 50 to 75 per cent of the male wage rates . 
The gender disparity in our country can be covered only through pro - active intervention in areas such as economic empowerment of women , building of adequate social and physical infrastructure and improving women’s role in governance . 
Empowerment of women is the key to not only meeting the objective of gender equality but also to elicit full participation from all our citizens in nation - building . 
We must strengthen the systems and processes that facilitate women to take control and claim ownership of their lives . 
To lend true meaning to empowerment , we have to expand their freedom of choice . 
As poor women are often incapacitated to act individually , social mobilization for their economic redemption is a critical necessity . 
Participatory institution building through self - help groups has been found to be one of the most effective tools for the empowerment of women in developing countries . 
As on 31st March 2012 , there were around 63 lakh all - women self - help groups in India that had combined bank savings of more than Rs . 5 , 100 crore . 
The number of such self - help groups is increasing , with a growth rate of 9 . 2 , 14 . 8 and 3 . 3 per cent during 2009 - 10 , 2010 - 11 and 2011 - 12 respectively . 
The micro - finance initiatives based on mutual or self - help method is conducive for women empowerment , as by emphasizing on group ownership , control and management and collective decision making , women also become prepared for participation in local governance structures . 
I am happy that India is a proud repository of such initiatives best exemplified by model organizations like SEWA . 
Ms . Bhatt has been recognized both nationally and internationally for empowering women in our country and enabling them lead a life of dignity and independence . 
Ms . Bhatt’s life and work is truly reflective of the philosophy and ideals espoused by our Late Prime Minister , Shrimati Indira Gandhi . 
The prize bestowed upon Ms . Bhatt today is a tribute to her unflinching zeal towards the betterment of women in society and progress of humanity . 
I am convinced that Ms . Bhatt’s example will spur many more initiatives in our country and elsewhere , aimed at renewal of society and all - round development of people . 
I urge SEWA to continue to expand the outstanding work it does aimed at promotion of entrepreneurship amongst poor women . 
I wish Ms . Bhatt and SEWA every success in her future efforts . 
Address by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee to Parliament
I welcome you to this session as I address this joint sitting of the two Houses for the first time as President . 
I hope this session will be productive and useful . 
As I speak to you , I am aware that an aspirational India is emerging , an India that demands more opportunities , greater choices , better infrastructure , and enhanced safety and security . 
Our youth , our greatest national asset , are a confident and courageous lot . 
I have no doubt that their passion , energy and enterprise will take India to new heights . 
Amidst these aspirations , we are also burdened by gathering anxieties about economic slowdown , job security and employment prospects . 
People are concerned about the security of our women and children . 
They are also anxious about timely delivery of their entitlements and about persisting social and economic inequality . 
The past year has been a very difficult one for the global economy . 
Europe is in recession . 
Most emerging markets are growing very slowly . 
It has been a difficult year for India also . 
Both global and domestic factors have affected our growth . 
We need to address the impact of both . 
My Government has responded to the situation by taking several measures to revive investment activity and investor sentiment . 
An important initiative that my Government has taken recently is the rollout of the Direct Benefits Transfer system . 
This would enable Government sponsored benefits such as scholarships , pensions and maternity benefits to flow directly into the accounts of beneficiaries , who can access them using their Aadhaar number . 
In due course , the Direct Benefits Transfer System will also cover wages and subsidies on food and LPG . 
This system will help cut down leakages , bring millions of people into the financial system and lead to better targeting of beneficiaries
It will be a trend - setter in the use of modern technology to bring benefits to our poorest citizens , especially in rural areas . 
However , the Direct Benefits Transfer System will not be a substitute for public services and will be complementary to the Public Distribution System . 
The average annual growth rate of GDP in the 11th Plan , which concluded last year , was 8 % . 
A notable feature of the Plan was the progress towards achieving inclusiveness with a faster decline in poverty than in the previous decade . 
The National Development Council has recently adopted the 12th Five Year Plan , which further sharpens the focus on faster , more inclusive and sustainable growth . 
The 12th Plan recognises that growth outcomes will depend upon the extent to which we are able to take some difficult decisions . 
The Plan proposes to consolidate Centrally Sponsored Schemes into a smaller number and increase their flexibility . 
This will give States the much - needed freedom to experiment and innovate . 
The Indian economy is currently experiencing slower growth . Real GDP grew by 5 . 4 % in the first half of the current fiscal year . 
This is significantly lower than the average of around 8 % in the last decade . 
Our slower growth is the consequence of a combination of global and domestic factors . 
My Government is taking steps to deal with the factors responsible for the slowdown . 
Inflation is easing gradually but is still a problem . 
In recent months , there have been positive developments too . 
There has been a moderation in core inflation and recovery in growth is likely . 
Policy measures announced during the year have also restored optimism at home and abroad . 
My Government has announced a roadmap for fiscal consolidation by containing the current year’s fiscal deficit at 5 . 3 % of the GDP . 
The Government is also working with State Governments to reach a consensus on the Goods and Services Tax . 
There is reason for cheer on the agricultural front . 
The growth in agriculture and allied sectors during the 11th plan was 3 . 7 % compared to 2 . 4 % in the 10th Plan . 
I am proud to mention that relentless efforts of farmers coupled with conducive policies of the Government , have resulted in record foodgrain production for two consecutive years with last year achieving a peak of 260 million tons
This year , despite erratic and deficient rainfall , it is projected that we will produce more than 250 million tons of foodgrains . 
Our foodgrains position is , therefore , comfortable . 
The total stock of foodgrains with the public sector agencies was 662 lakh tons on 1st February 2013 , including 307 lakh tons of wheat and over 353 lakh tons of rice .

On behalf of my Government , I appeal to all of you to support our endeavours in marching ahead as a proud nation . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of 2nd South East Asia Implant Conference - ' Implant Esthetics , 2013 ' 
It is a pleasure for me to be here on the occasion of this inaugural ceremony . 
I congratulate the International Congress of Oral Implantologists for their initiative in hosting the 2nd South East Asia Implant Symposium on " Implant Esthetics . 
I am indeed happy to see that the participants in the symposium include delegates from our immediate neighbourhood - who will directly benefit from our country ' s progress in this field . 
I also appreciate the presence of participants from across the oceans - from nations that are our close partners and collaborators - including Korea , Taiwan , West Indies , the Gulf , Iran and the U . K . 
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen , it is a good development that oral health care , as a science , has grown in popularity and there is , today , a greater awareness of dentistry as a profession in our country . 
I am particularly pleased at the awareness that this conference will generate - at a time when there is still a deficiency of oral health care facilities in many cities and towns of India . 
The presence , at this Conference of Dentists and other professionals from as far as Kerala and Karnataka and smaller towns in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat is a good sign - indicating that not only urban populations but societies located deeper in the heartland of India are working together to bring their people better access to dental health facilities . 
In this context , dental implants are a specialized category - an option available , till today , to only a privileged few - those able to afford it . 
While the Indus Valley civilisation used bow drills 7000 years ago and Egyptians practiced oral surgery from as early as 2500 BC , the Mayan civilization is said to have used the earliest known examples of implants embedded into bone dating back to about 600 A . D . They were found to have used tooth shaped shells . 
From the time that the first modern implant was placed in 1952 , modern medicine has developed rapidly and now titanium is used to build ' posts ' that function as ' roots ' for implants . 
Today dental implants are said to have a success rate of about 75 % . Techniques and technologies are continuously being improved and refined every day . 
The conceptualization of economically viable dental implants that are available , affordable and accessible to all sections of society is a noteworthy milestone indeed . 
The Indian Dental Association , in working towards this , is making an important contribution to our society . 
I understand that dental implants today constitute the single largest growing dental specialty . 
It is recognized as an important and popular subject of specialization and there is every justification for the science of implantology to be incorporated into dental education and given due priority in the curriculum of dental institutions throughout our country . 
I am told that the Army Dental Corps , together with the DRDO are presently developing indigenous technology that can make implants all the more efficacious and readily available to our armed forces and civilian population . 
I also gather that dental tourism as a concept has caught the imagination of foreign visitors who would like to take advantage of the high quality of implant services and related treatments that are more affordable in India . 
I am glad to learn that the Dental Council of India proposes to take up the study of the epidemiology of oral diseases including dental caries , periodontal diseases and oral cancer . 
I certainly subscribe to the view that preventive measures are as important as clinical intervention . 
Although oral health should always be an inseparable companion of general health care , modern dentistry has evolved slowly in India . 
It would therefore , be an invaluable service if the medical and dental community were to organize community health programmes - based on their evaluation of the changing priorities of the community and taking into account the technology and solutions available . 
A continuous assessment of ethical , socio - economical and legal implications should be taken up as a matter of course by our institutions and they must be accountable for the healthcare solutions adopted by them . 
Every new methodology which successfully passes the mandatory trials and testing is , eventually and in each case , another success story , a welcome step forward by our scientific community . 
I am sure that this symposium will have far reaching outcomes and also succeed in promoting co - operation among the participating students and professionals in the field of dental implantation . 
I offer my felicitations to the Dental Council of India and their associates and all the participants in today ' s conference and wish them every success in their individual and collective efforts and future initiatives . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Launch of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle ( PSLV ) - C20 Saral Mission
I was delighted to witness the remarkable launch of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle ( PSLV ) C20 SARAL Mission , along with six more satellites today . 
It is a pleasure to be in the midst of distinguished scientists and technologists who have gathered here to celebrate the culmination of the meticulously executed chain of events and rigourous pre - launch preparations for the Mission . 
I congratulate the Indian Space Research Organization ( ISRO ) for successfully executing this Mission . 
I am confident that the SARAL spacecraft launched today would function as planned and perform as designed and serve the intended applications in Ocean Topography , Coastal Altimetry , Ocean currents monitoring and Animal migration studies worldwide . 
The PSLV has become a household name in our country and this mission would only reaffirm this position through its efficacy , accuracy and reliability of this launch vehicle . 
An important manifestation of India ' s bilateral cooperation with foreign countries is in the field of Space technology . 
I congratulate the French space agency , Centre National d ' etudes Spatiales ( CNES ) , for whole - heartedly participating in this collaborative mission . 
This mission epitomizes the spirit of the Indo - French partnership , which the two nations have shared for decades . 
Curiosity is mankind ' s second nature and human beings have always sought to unearth the mysteries that lie beyond our Mother Earth . 
The desire to know the unknown has driven us to inculcate a scientific temper for inquiry . 
India ' s space programme is about half a century old though our rich legacy of astronomy dates back to Aryabhatta and Bhaskara . 
Due to the genius of our space scientists led by stalwarts such as Dr . Vikram Sarabhai , Dr . Satish Dhawan , Prof . U . R . Rao , Prof . Kasturirangan and others , our space programme has over the years become successful in delivering to our country indigenous capability in design and development of satellites , launch vehicles and space applications . 
It is heartening to note that in the road towards self - reliance , ISRO has played a vital role in the enhancement of technology levels and indigenization of strategic materials . 
The Indian National Satellite System is today a proud repository of the largest group of communication satellites in the Asia Pacific region . 
Our launch capabilities have been duly acknowledged the world over , with ISRO increasingly launching satellites of other countries . 
Challenges to our country ' s progress are many and they cannot be successfully countered without technology playing a pivotal role in the effort . 
This is true whether it is for ushering in a sustainable development paradigm , establish a strong agricultural sector , respond to climate change , building the rural sector amongst others . 
Our space programme has all along been an application - oriented initiative , and hence , been an able partner in our development process . 
Our first Prime Minister , Late Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru had once said and I quote : 
" It is science alone that can solve the problems of hunger and poverty , of insanitation and illiteracy , of superstition and deadening custom and tradition , of vast resources running to waste , of a rich country inhabited by starving people . . . 
Who indeed could afford to ignore science today ? 
At every turn we have to seek its aid . . . the future belongs to science and those who make friends with science . 
Our scientific progress has been built on this philosophy . 
We have used space applications to bring government closer to people , particularly those who are far removed from urban centers and reside in remote areas of the country . 
Space - based applications like tele - education and tele - medicine have enabled greater access to our rural population to these basic needs . 
The telemedicine project has made it possible for health care centres in remote locations to connect with super specialty hospitals in towns and cities through INSAT satellites for provision of health care facility to the needy and under - served population . 
I am told that 1 . 5 lakh people are availing of the telemedicine facility annually . 
The EDUSAT satellite has brought about a change in the way education is delivered in our schools , colleges and universities , including the non - formal education system . 
Interactive education has made it possible to bring education closer to our students , particularly those located in under - served areas . 
The Village Resource Centre initiative , which connects resource centres like Agricultural Universities , Skill Development Institutes and Hospitals for training of people in diverse fields such as agriculture , horticulture , fisheries , livestock , water resources , computer literacy , micro finance and vocational training , is commendable . 
Over five lakh people have availed of this facility and I am sure many more will do so in the future . 
Our farmers have hugely benefitted from weather forecasting as also tele - agriculture initiatives that educate them about different methods and techniques of farming . 
Management of our natural resources has greatly relied on our remote sensing capabilities . 
Such socially relevant uses of technology that meet our country ' s development goals are imperative to address the demands of our population . 
Our endeavour must be to lower the cost of access to space through greater innovation and drive towards technology refinement . 
ISRO enjoys tremendous trust amongst our countrymen . 
This faith and confidence puts the onus back on the organization to raise the bar of its performance , scale greater heights and explore newer frontiers . 
Over the past three years , ISRO has successfully accomplished an impressive array of 15 missions including CARTOSAT - 2B , MEGHATROPIQUES , RISAT - 1 and a number of PSLV launches . 
The entire nation is eagerly looking forward for the successful flight of the Geo - Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle ( GSLV ) , with the Indigenous Cryogenic Stage . 
The planned experimental mission of GSLV Mark 3 is a huge step forward in the development of heavy - lift space transportation system in the country . 
Our Chandrayaan - 1 mission made the country proud . 
I am also confident of the first Indian inter - planetary venture , The Mars Orbiter Mission , targeted for this year , to be successful and to place India into the ranks of the few Nations that have attempted such a feat . 
For India to occupy its rightful place in the comity of nation , we must promote innovation and technological advancement . 
ISRO should be in the forefront of such a movement . 
I am certain that ISRO , with its team of able , energetic and committed professionals , will meet the future scientific and technological challenges and continue to be a nerve centre of innovation and creativity . 
I wish ISRO every success in the missions to come . Let me conclude by saying that India ' s tryst with space will continue to evoke awe amongst many . 
Convocation address and acceptance speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the ceremony conference The Doctor of Laws Honoris Causa on Him by The University of Dhaka
I am delighted to be here today in your midst at this historic venue . 
You have given me an extraordinary welcome . 
I am overwhelmed by the love and affection you have showered on me , and by this magnificent reception . 
Bangladesh is the first country that I am visiting as President of India . 
The last visit by an Indian President to Bangladesh was almost forty years ago by President V . V . Giri in 1974 . 
For me personally , this is an emotional journey . 
I have my roots in the soil of Bengal , and have imbibed its language , traditions and culture . 
My wife was born in Narail and started her education here . 
I have grown up reading the compositions of the same poets as you , listening to the same songs which both our people love and walked along the banks of the same rivers which inspire the songs that make us all similarly wistful . 
When I was a child I never dreamt that one day I would come here as the President of my country . 
I was overwhelmed by the spontaneous outpouring of support and goodwill that I received from the people of Bangladesh when I became the President of India . 
I received many congratulatory messages from people from all walks of life and all parts of this country . 
I take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the people of Bangladesh for their good wishes on that day . 
Today , I stand on hallowed ground at this great University of Dhaka which will soon celebrate its centenary . 
It has been a century of accomplishment and on this occasion of its convocation ceremony , I felicitate all the students of this University who have successfully graduated in their respective academic disciplines . Dhaka University is the oldest and largest public University in Bangladesh . 
Today , as we recall its old reputation as the " Oxford of the East” , we note with pride its place among the top institutions of contemporary Asia . 
Students who graduate today are following in the footsteps of the great alumni who passed through these portals in the generations before you . 
The names of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , Tajuddin Ahmed , Satyendranath Bose , R . C . Majumdar , Humayun Ahmed , Buddhadeb Basu and Shamsur Rahman come to mind . 
They include many of the brightest minds of the last century – who distinguished themselves through their academic achievements . 
No one who comes here can forget how uniquely this University is identified with your nationhood . 
The halls of this great institution were the crucible and the ‘Karmabhoomi’ of the creation of Bangladesh . 
Numberless architects of the Liberation War sacrificed their lives in this campus and before them there were the pioneers . 
Who can forget the day of February 21 , 1952 when the students of Dhaka University defied the banning of public rallies by the then Government ? 
The sacrifices made by the martyrs of the language movement have now been recognized by the United Nations , which has declared February 21 as the " International Mother Language Day . 
It was again the students of Dhaka University who heroically resisted the brutal attack on the night of March 25 , 1971 that killed more than three hundred of their colleagues , faculty members and intelligentsia . 
They along with many others had been a bulwark against the intolerance and hatred which had descended on this land – and who , in the years after Liberation , took forward the socio - political transformation of the country . 
Today , when Bangladesh is free and liberated and is happily engaged in its own development , the sacrifices of its martyrs are vindicated . 
It is because of them that the youth of Bangladesh are today able to call this land their own . 
Young men and women like you are the engine of socio - economic development of our region . 
You should know that you have a past which is steeped in glory , and a future that is full of promise . 
I have been deeply impressed by the maturity , awareness and involvement of the youth of Bangladesh in the task of nation building . 
It is a labour of love - that is how the Father of this nation – Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman described his inspiration : 
As a man , what concerns mankind concerns me . 
As a Bengalee I am deeply involved in all that concerns Bengalees . 
This abiding involvement is born and nourished by love , enduring love , which gives meaning to my politics and to my very being . 
It is this extraordinary spirit of humanity and confidence that has been instrumental in the advancement of Bangladesh by leaps and bounds . 
Bangladesh has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in South Asia . 
This is laudable . I would compliment the government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the people of Bangladesh for their achievements in all aspects of human development . 
In many social indicators , Bangladesh has acquitted itself in an exemplary manner . 
It is seen that the literacy rate amongst youth in Bangladesh - in the age bracket of 15 to 24 years – is now 77 percent while life expectancy at birth is now about 69 years . 
You have made good progress and set new benchmarks in the amelioration of poverty , eradication of hunger and universalization of education . 
The school text book programme of Bangladesh is known to be one of the largest in the world – and the gross enrollment ratio at the secondary school level is now about 51 percent . 
While the poverty ratio in Bangladesh is about 31 percent , you have world class achievements on which the edifice of a prosperous and developed Bangladesh will be built . 
I am sure that you , the youth of Bangladesh , will carry forward this great task with dedication . 
If , today , Bangladesh has embraced democracy , it is largely due to the values and principles which its people held dear when they fought for their independence in 1971 . 
You , better than anyone else , know that democracy means the ability to respect differences and allow the will of the people to prevail for the common good . 
You know that it means respect for the rule of law and building of strong institutions along with free speech and a vibrant media . 
I am confident that democratic traditions in Bangladesh will grow stronger with time and that you will preserve democracy with your constant vigil . 
India and Bangladesh are interlinked like no other nations on earth . 
Our destinies are interwoven just like our history and our geography . 
Within our resources , India remains committed to supporting the comprehensive development of Bangladesh and the aspirations of its people . 
We believe that India and Bangladesh must develop and grow together , ensuring that our growth provides more opportunities to both our peoples . 
We both face common challenges and , as Her Excellency , Prime Minister , Sheikh Hasina has said , we have the same enemy – poverty . 
We need to work together to maximize the potential of our economic cooperation . 
Bangladesh is uniquely placed to exploit its natural and human resources to emerge as a fast growing , modern economy . 
Apart from the potential of its resources on land and sea , the geographical location of Bangladesh is an advantage that must be fully explored and exploited . 
Bangladesh lies at the cross - roads of South and South - East Asia . The idea of South Asian regional cooperation was born in Bangladesh . 
Bangladesh has once again taken the leadership in moving towards sub - regional cooperation . 
This will lead to practical results in terms of better water management , more electricity and grid connectivity , more trade and more cross - country movement of goods and people . 
India and Bangladesh can lead the way towards greater integration within our region and beyond in South East Asia . 
Bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh have received a major boost following the visit of Her Excellency Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India in January 2010 and our Prime Minister’s visit to Bangladesh in September 2011 . 
We now have a " Framework Agreement on Cooperation for Development” that lays down the roadmap for our work together in the years to come . 
I am happy to note that both countries have made considerable progress in the implementation of the far - reaching decisions taken during these historic Visits . 
I assure you that India remains committed to implementing the decisions that have been taken . 
India and Bangladesh have vast opportunities to increase our bilateral trade and commerce . 
Government of India has taken the first step by removing quota and duty restrictions from all categories of imports from Bangladesh except twenty five tariff lines . 
. Bangladesh now has duty - free access to our large market . I invite Bangladesh’s industry to make full use of this opportunity . 
We are working with the Government of Bangladesh to remove the remaining non - tariff barriers , open more border haats and harmonise our respective standards . 
The recently signed Revised Travel Arrangements between India and Bangladesh will lead to the liberalisation of visa arrangements between our countries . 
These will particularly help businessmen , students , journalists , tourists and those travelling for medical treatment . 
Greater people - to - people contacts and exchanges are the best way to bring our two countries even closer together . 
I am happy with the progress made in the implementation of the Line of Credit extended by my Government to the Government of Bangladesh . 
Several development projects , especially those pertaining to the railways sector , are now beginning to take off . 
I was happy to see double decker buses purchased under the Line of Credit plying on the roads . 
Many new Indian locomotives and wagons will soon be on the rail lines of Bangladesh . 
We have offered a grant of 200 million US Dollars to Bangladesh for utilization in projects of priority to Bangladesh . 
The first tranche - of 50 million US Dollars of this grant - was handed over a few weeks ago . 
Our countries have also made considerable progress in our co - operation in the power sector . 
The power grids of our countries will , for the first time in our post - independence history , be connected by the middle of this year . 
This will allow the flow of 500 MW of power from India to Bangladesh . 
The India - Bangladesh Friendship Power Company is setting up an ultra - modern super thermal 1320 MW power station at Rampal near Mongla to meet the energy needs of Bangladesh . 
My Government proposes to introduce a Constitutional Amendment Bill in Parliament to give effect to the provisions of the Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh and its 2011 Protocol . 
We are committed to working closely with Bangladesh to avoid any untoward incidents on our border . 
We can together make it a gateway of peace and mutually beneficial cooperation . 
The sharing of the waters of our common rivers is a high priority for us . 
We have successfully forged agreements in the past and are hopeful of arriving at an early accord on the sharing of the Teesta waters . 
Meanwhile , there are areas where we must substantially increase our cooperation , such as in information technology , skill development , agricultural research , environment protection , climate change , and in protecting the Sunderbans and harnessing energies , both traditional as well as new and renewable sources of energy . 
We must invest more in the field of education . 
There must be more exchanges of students , faculty , research scholars and academics between us . 
Government of India offers a large number of scholarships for students and professionals from Bangladesh . 
Many more students from Bangladesh are coming to India at their own cost to pursue higher studies . 
The Indian Council for Cultural Relations has established a Tagore Chair and a Hindi Chair at Dhaka University . 
These have contributed to greater academic exchanges between India and Bangladesh . 
I was delighted to meet a 100 - strong youth delegation , the first ever from Bangladesh , last year . 
Many of the students were from the Dhaka University . 
I am happy to note that a similar delegation will again visit India this year . 
There are few countries in the world where music , poetry , art and drama are as deeply ingrained in a nation’s conscience as in Bangladesh . 
There is a lot that we , in India , can learn from you . 
I have the pleasure to announce that the Visva Bharati University at Santi Niketan will provide land within its campus to Bangladesh for the construction of ‘Bangladesh Bhaban’ . 
This will serve as a focal point for research and documentation under the ‘Bangladesh Studies Programme’ of Visva Bharati . 
Looking at you , I am convinced that the future of Bangladesh is bright . 
I wish you all every success in making the dream of Sonar Bangla a reality . 
India will stand by your side as you shape the destiny of your country . 
He felt that religion should be a weapon for self transformation as well as transformation of the society . 
His Guru , Shri Ramakrishna Paramhansa , had taught him that service to man was service to God . 
Swamiji made this principle the basis of his social service programme . 
He imbibed the message of his Guru that anything which helps to realize God in this life should be accepted as conducive to the practice of religion and realization of the Highest Truth . 
Swamiji never thought of his Guru in relation to his own personal life but thought of him in relation to India and the rest of the world . 
Swamiji was undoubtedly a brilliant scholar and a profound thinker . 
He combined his wisdom with his concern for the nation and her suffering masses . 
He travelled extensively within the country to understand their problems . 
He was deeply troubled by the abject poverty of our masses and held that the country’s downfall was primarily due to suppression of the poor , who were also immersed in ignorance and superstition . 
He was deeply troubled by the abject poverty of our masses and held that the country’s downfall was primarily due to suppression of the poor , who were also immersed in ignorance and superstition . 
Swamiji believed that every human being is endowed with immense potentiality , but to realize it , people need self confidence
He used to say , " He is an atheist who does not believe in himself” . 
In his speeches and teachings , he boosted the confidence of people by saying that and I quote : " All power is within you ; you can do anything and everything ; believe in that , do not believe that you are weak” . 
Swamiji did not prescribe any abrupt change in society . 
He believed that socio - economic change can be brought about through education . 
He felt that people should be exposed to two kinds of education – secular education comprising knowledge about new techniques in agriculture and village industries that would help them to emancipate economically , and spiritual education to revive their sense of self - belief and worth and to give them hope for a better future . 
Swamiji established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897 to what he described as creating the ‘machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest’ . 
The Mission has since been at the service of the poor and needy , carrying out programmes in the field of health care and education , women welfare , youth welfare , relief and rehabilitation , and work towards regeneration of rural and tribal areas . 
It has inspired other noble initiatives to come forward and contribute to social development in a meaningful way . 
Swamiji attended the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893 as a true representative of his country and religion , and defined India’s standing as a great ancient civilization that offers the world a beautiful opportunity to learn from its living culture and philosophy . 
When I visited Chicago one year back , I had the privilege of unveiling a plaque at the place where Swamiji had delivered his famous address in 1893 . 
Through his speeches at Chicago , and his subsequent work in America and England , Swamiji showed the universal relevance and significance of India’s ancient philosophy and spiritual culture in solving many of the problems associated with modern living . 
Swami Vivekananda was a bridge between the East and the West . 
He taught our countrymen to adapt Indian ethos to the notions of Western humanism such as individual freedom , justice and respect for women . 
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose once said , Swamiji harmonized the East and the West , religion and science , past and present . 
Our countrymen have gained unprecedented self - respect , self - reliance and self - assertion from his teachings . 
Though Swamiji never gave any political message , many freedom fighters have derived inspiration and developed a sense of patriotism through his writings and speeches . 
Mahatma Gandhi had once said about Swamiji : " I have gone through his works thoroughly , and after having gone through them , the love that I had for my country became a thousand - fold” . 
He loved and treated all human beings as equal without any distinction of caste , religion , race , nationality or gender . 
He believed in egalitarian philosophy and wanted equal opportunities for all by not bringing down the higher , but raising the lower up to the level of the higher . 
Being a Universalist , Swami Vivekananda’s knowledge and understanding of spiritualism went beyond Hinduism . 
He was deeply familiar with the messages of other religions . 
Swamiji laid the foundation for harmony amongst religions and also harmony between religion and science . 
All through his life , Swamiji had spread his Guru’s message of harmony of religions : " Yato Mat , Tato Path” ( As many faiths , so many paths ) . 
Swamiji viewed religion as the ‘science of consciousness’ and believed that religion and modern science are complementary rather than contradictory . 
He portrayed religion as a universal concept and liberated it from the age - old scourges of superstitions , dogma and intolerance . 
To commemorate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Swami Vivekananda , a National Committee under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister and a National Implementation Committee , which I had chaired when I was the Finance Minister , was constituted . 
It is gratifying to note that under the guidance of these committees , several activities have been undertaken to mark this event such as printing of books on the life and teachings of Swamiji in different languages , production and circulation of audio visual material on Swamiji , propagation of his teachings through media , and conservation of monuments of different religions as a mark of respect to his views on religious harmony . 
The universality of Swamiji’s teachings holds great relevance in the modern world . 
Despite progress made by us , our society is confronted with issues challenging our ethics and morality . 
Swamiji’s teachings should be our guiding light in our path to the future . 
I hope that Swamiji’s 150th Birth Anniversary would be an occasion to awaken our minds to the great contributions and sacrifices made by him towards the welfare , progress and enlightenment of mankind . 
Let us rededicate ourselves to the causes for which Swamiji devoted his entire life . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Kumudini Welfare Trust Of Bangladesh
I am delighted to be here with you at Kumudini and the Bharateshwari Home for Girls . 
You have put up an extraordinary performance which combines beauty with elegance , discipline and physical fitness . 
I am truly impressed and overwhelmed by your talent and hard work . 
Looking at all of you I can see that Bangladesh has a very bright future . 
Each of you will one day go forth into the outside world . 
The training and education that you are receiving here will equip you to become proud and productive citizens of your motherland . 
You will be the makers of a new Bangladesh . 
To everybody you are the representatives of the youth who aspire to see a beautiful future . 
Our greetings to you , the youth of Bangladesh . 
In the last speech of my visit to this wonderful country , I am quoting a few verses from a poem by Gurudeb Rabindranath : 
Where the world is without fear and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up
By narrow domestic walls . . . . 
Bangladesh has taken rapid strides in the field of education and women’s empowerment . 
A growing number of girls are now attending school . 
I congratulate the Government of Bangladesh for taking far reaching initiatives in the field of education such as compulsory primary education , free education for girls up to class ten , stipends for female students and distribution of free text books . 
Women’s education is an essential pre - requisite for building a healthy and safe society . 
This however cannot be done by governments alone , and I am therefore glad that the Kumudini Trust has joined the national effort to impart quality education to girls in Bangladesh . 
I take this opportunity to remember , with profound respect , Shri Ranada Prasad Shaha , one of the greatest philanthropists of this country . 
He and his family had dedicated themselves to the service of the suffering and the needy . 
One of Shri Ranada Prasad’s priorities was to establish a hospital for the poor so that they , especially women , could receive free treatment . 
To spread female education , he established schools that were dedicated to girls , giving them a well - rounded education and moulding them into socially responsible women . 
It is sad that not only Shri Ranada Prasad Shaha but also his family suffered considerably in the days before the creation of Bangladesh . 
We respect them for their bravery and pay homage to their memory . 
It is a tribute to him that the Kumudini Trust and its affiliated bodies have grown from strength to strength , and have served the nation so well . 
The Kumudini hospital and medical college have been carrying out charitable work for the most needy and destitute . 
You are fortunate to be studying in an institution which symbolizes the highest values of selfless service . 
As a small token of support of the Government of India for your efforts , I am happy to announce that we will fund the upgradation of the sewerage system of your Complex which , I understand , has been a long pending need . 
In addition , we will also fund the construction of an advanced waste water treatment plant system . 
I am happy to be informed that the project will significantly change the landscape of the Complex and that the land saved from the installation of the waste water treatment system will be gainfully used for agriculture and other productive purposes . 
I recall that some of you had met me as part of a Youth Delegation that visited Delhi last year . 
Today , I am happy to be here to meet you and to see , for myself , this remarkable institution . 
I am deeply impressed by what I have seen and have no doubt that you will be outstanding citizens of Bangladesh . 
I wish each one of you the best of success and a bright future . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of The Seventh Biennial Grassroots Innovation Awards adn Inauguration of Innovation Exhibition
It is indeed a privilege for me to be present on this occasion and to participate in this programme of National Innovation Foundation , which is being celebrated to recognize the achievements of grassroots innovators . 
At the outset , I compliment the National Innovation Foundation . 
The India story of social transformation is slowly unfolding . 
In this decade of innovation , every sector needs prudent solutions to persistent problems . 
The achievements of the National Innovation Foundation ( NIF ) over the last decade , based on the voluntary contribution of thousands of Honey Bee Network members are creditable . 
Reaching out to different villages through Shodh Yatras , a new idiom of social connectivity has been achieved at the grassroots level . 
Recognizing creative people at their doorsteps sends a message that the country cares for the rich knowledge of otherwise less - known people . 
I am particularly happy that in the 7th Biennial Awards there are innovators from all parts of the country . 
There are children and there are also older people . 
Obviously , innovative solutions can be found at any age . 
But if we start early , we can make a much bigger impact over a life - time . 
I suggest that NIF organizes workshops for creative children who are awarded every year to help them understand and meet the social challenges in their lives . 
Their creativity and inquisitiveness has to be harnessed for larger social good . 
School and college textbooks should also have a few lessons based on the life of grassroots innovators and innovative children . 
Among the various weak links in the value chain around grassroots innovations , the absence of community fabrication workshops and laboratories is a major gap . 
The effort by NIF to provide basic fabrication facilities to grassroots innovators in the form of 27 community workshops in 13 States , including one in Jammu and Kashmir and seven in the North - Eastern States , is laudable . 
Conversion of an idea into a prototype is an important stage in any incubation cycle . 
Such fabrication support near an innovator’s place would reduce his transaction costs considerably and help the transformation of an idea into reality . 
There are many examples of innovations being recognized this year , which demonstrate an ability of grassroots innovators to develop robust , frugal and efficient solutions to local problems such as bamboo processing machines , and multipurpose herbal processing machine for fruits and herbs . 
They not only trigger entrepreneurial opportunities for the innovators but also generate sustainable livelihood options for the users . Various developmental programmes should encourage field trials of such innovations to expand livelihood opportunities in the country . 
NIF should take up innovative and socially useful technologies under the Grassroots Technological Innovation Acquisition Fund and get them licensed at low cost or no cost to entrepreneurs in different parts of the country . 
It must be ensured that the benefits reach the masses as early as possible . 
The social media tools can also be leveraged to spread the reach of socially useful technologies at no additional cost . 
I realize that unless financial support is available at an early stage of risky innovative ventures , the aspirations of thousands of creative people will remain unfilled . 
We have to collectively ensure that no idea remains unattended for want of sufficient support . 
Unless NIF begins with the incubation of two to three thousand ideas , it will not get those few hundred potentially viable leads which may eventually generate twenty to thirty breakthroughs in the market place . 
We need to work collectively to ensure that all potential ideas are exploited in the larger national interest . 
Recently , while interacting with the Vice Chancellors of Central Universities , I advised them to have a chapter of the National Innovation Club in every University . 
These clubs should search and spread innovations , sense and identify the problems and celebrate the outstanding achievements in the hinterland . 
The academic institutions should pay closer attention to the creative potential of our society and try to add value to the grassroots innovations to enable commercial or social diffusion . 
Such partnerships have to play a crucial role in mobilizing the energy of youth and their faculty guides for making India a truly inclusive society . 
This link between the formal and informal science will not only help these grassroots technologies to graduate into viable products but also trigger experimental ethic amongst others . 
Universities can also establish co - creation labs where young students and innovators work together . 
A small exhibition of various creative ideas from the hinterland will provide a daily spur to young minds and thus challenge their inertia . 
I am happy that various labs of Indian Council of Medical Research , Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and Indian Council of Agricultural Research are actively supporting the grassroots innovation movement . 
I call upon the private sector to also take steps in supporting this inclusive innovation movement . 
The knowledge of women is very crucial in making our society inclusive . 
We have to recognize , identify and enhance their ability to solve social problems with the support of the formal system . 
The agricultural growth needs to be accelerated to improve the living conditions of vast majority of people dependent on it . 
I notice that a large number of innovations recognized by NIF are from this sector . 
If the departments of agriculture at the central and state level share these ideas , many more farmers , artisans , fishermen and women will be encouraged to experiment . 
Incentives for scientists , extension workers , public administrators to help in spreading and spawning creative ideas of people for mass or niche applications are essential . 
Those who help spread the innovations deserve no less recognition than those who develop them . 
I am told that NIF is also including such officials in the list of partnership awards to create a healthy , synergistic and mutually supportive innovation eco - system in the country . 
India is perhaps the only country where grassroots innovations are a part of National Innovation System . 
We have to now institutionalize the culture of innovation at all levels of public administration so that tales of persistent neglect of Indian genius become a matter of past . 
In future , no creative voice should remain unheard , no innovative mind should remain unengaged and no story of institutional transformation should remain untold to our young generation . 
In the 150th year of Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary , I appeal to the youth to rededicate themselves to make India a creative , collaborative and compassionate society . 
There are many problems , which have remained unsolved despite all the gains in science and technology . 
Be it transplantation of paddy , picking of tealeaves , the tools of cobblers , the drudgery of manual head loaders . 
I am happy that NIF has announced attractive awards to those who can offer innovative and extremely affordable solutions for the purpose . 
I wish innovators all the success in their future endeavours and hope that they will continue striving for reducing drudgery , improving efficiency , and enhancing the quality of life of the masses without impairing their environment . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of The First Tagore Award on Cultural Harmony to Late Pandit Ravi Shankar
I feel honoured to present the first Tagore Award for Cultural Harmony for the year 2012 to Late Pandit Ravi Shankar , the great Indian Sitar Maestro whose renditions had and will continue to enthrall the world . 
Though Pandit Ravi Shankar is no more with us in his physical form , his music will always remain with us and remind us of the profound contributions he made towards internationalization of Indian classical music . 
I am glad that his wife , Shrimati Sukanya Shankar , and his daughter , Ms . Anoushka Shankar , are here today to accept the award . 
As part of the commemoration of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore , this award was instituted to promote values of universal brotherhood . 
In May 2012 , in the closing ceremony of the Tagore commemoration , I had the privilege of announcing the name of Pandit Ravi Shankar as the recipient of the first Tagore Award . 
Rabindranath Tagore was a literary icon who was fascinated by the idea of interaction between civilizations through the exchange of knowledge about their cultures and literatures . 
This versatile genius , being a poet , an author , a composer , a painter , a philosopher and an educationist , was the perfect ambassador of our country for cultural exchange with the world outside . 
The literature , history and culture of different nations reflect the universal values of humanity . 
In a world still fettered by race , creed and colour , Rabindranath Tagore promoted internationalism for a new world order based on diversity , open - mindedness , tolerance , and co - existence of many cultures . 
This bard of India made the world his home . 
The Visva Bharati University , which he established in 1921 , was set up on the ideal of " Yatra Visvam Bhavati eka needam” ( " where the world makes its home in a single nest " ) . 
He visualized a cosmopolitan place of learning where students from different cultures would meet and learn from one another . 
When Rabindranath Tagore was born in 1861 , the collective consciousness of our people was afflicted by feelings of inferiority . 
By the year 1941 when he breathed his last , these ideas were no longer prevalent . 
Tagore was among the pioneers in bringing this sea change in attitude . 
He preached the religion of Truth and Harmony , and of Love and Sympathy . 
As we celebrate the centenary of the first Asian to be awarded the Nobel Prize , it is befitting that we confer the award instituted in his name to an equally loved son of India , Pandit Ravi Shankar . 
Late Pandit Ravi Shankar was India’s most esteemed musical Ambassador and a singular phenomenon in the world of classical music . 
As a composer , performer , teacher and writer , he rendered invaluable service to Indian music and culture . 
After years of dedicated training under his illustrious Guru , Baba Allaudin Khan , and establishing himself in the world of classical music in India , he embarked on a journey to the West to spread the beauty of Indian classical music . 
He is acclaimed for his pioneering work in bringing Indian classical music to the West and popularizing it . 
He studied the Sitar for seven years , eighteen hours a day , and became a master of the instrument which was then unknown in most of the world . 
He collaborated with renowned international figures in music to bring the Sitar to a position of prominence in the global music arena . 
He did the groundwork for other Indian musicians to follow , in performing Indian classical music across the world . 
The world is now permeated with the acceptance of Indian music , which is largely due to the vision of Pandit Ravi Shankar . 
The Sitar in the hands of Pandit Ravi Shankar was more than a musical instrument . 
Drawing on our own traditions , he made music a universal language . 
He was foremost in reaching out to the young , making sure Hindustani classical music found a place in their hearts and lives . 
It was Pandit Ravi Shankar who as a living legend deeply influenced many key Western artistes and musicians . 
He worked with artistes from different parts of the globe to bring before the world audience the idea of a composite culture as ancient as our land but as radiant as the ‘ragas’ he brought to life . 
His work with the great Yehudi Menuhin transcended faiths , regions and cultures . 
He has been recognized widely for his contribution to music and for bringing cultural harmony through music . 
He was bestowed the Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1962 , Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1992 , France’s highest civilian honour , the Knight of the Legion of Honour , besides a host of other important honours including Grammy Awards in his long and illustrious career . 
He was a recipient of the Bharat Ratna in 1999 . 
Pandit Ravi Shankar was a musical genius but he remained a humble human being throughout his life . 
In his Autobiography titled Raga Mala , he says : 
People ask me always what I want to be remembered by , and I would like it to be not for my mistakes , but for the things that I was able to achieve – those that have touched the hearts of the people in my own country and beyond . God has been kind to me and I have been very lucky indeed to have gained recognition and appreciation almost all over the world . 
It has been my good fortune that there have never been any problems with communicating the greatness of our music . 
His passing away from our midst has been a great loss to India and the world . 
His legacy , however , lives on and will continue to illuminate the world of music . 
With the conferment of the first Tagore Award for Cultural Harmony , we pay a tribute to Late Pandit Ravi Shankar for his enormous contribution to cultural harmony . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the presentation of The Stree Shakti Puraskar for the year 2012 on International Women ' s Day
It gives me immense pleasure to join you in the celebration of International Women’s Day . 
I take this opportunity to extend warm greetings to women in all parts of our country . 
I take this opportunity to extend warm greetings to women in all parts of our country . 
I am happy that on this occasion we are recognising the exemplary service of the outstanding women who have been conferred the Stree Shakti Awards today
We are paying tribute not only to them but to all women who have worked and contributed directly or indirectly to social development in our country . 
I am particularly happy that the Rani Lakshmi Bai Award has been given to " the spirit of Nirbhaya” and was received by the mother of the brave heart from Delhi . 
Nirbhaya as she is now known was a brave and courageous girl who fought till the very last minute for her dignity and her life . 
She is a true hero and symbolises the best in Indian youth and women . 
Her sad demise should not be in vain . We must do everything possible to ensure that such an incident never happens again . 
I will also like to felicitate and express my deep appreciation to other Awardees of Stree Shakti Puraskar namely Mrs . Pranita Talukdar of Assam , Ms . Sonika Agarwal of Delhi , Smt . Guramma H Sankina of Karnataka , Mrs . Omana T . K . of Kerala and Smt Olga D’Mello of Maharashtra for their invaluable contributions to the empowerment of women . 
On this International Women’s Day , let us resolve to redouble efforts for the protection of women and their welfare . 
We must strive to ensure that women feel safe and secure at all times in our country . 
We must inculcate in every member of our society the highest of respect for women . 
We as a society must work towards changing negative perceptions about women . 
Women should be provided a safe , secure and congenial environment in which their talents can flower and they can contribute their full share in the building of our nation . Our history , traditions , religions and cultural values as well as the Constitution demand nothing less . 
Women comprise 48 . 5 per cent of our total population and although the overall sex ratio has increased by 7 points during the decade 2001 to 2011 , the declining child sex ratio for children of 0 - 6 years of age , is disturbing . 
The figure for female literacy is also 16 . 7 percent below male literacy . 
Surveys have indicated that female hourly wage rates in agriculture also vary from 50 to 75 per cent of the male wage rates . 
More disturbing is the increase in the incidence of violence against women . 
Although the new millennium has witnessed a significant attitudinal shift in our approach to gender equality and women’s emancipation , we still carry forward the ingrained complexities of patriarchy . 
India ranks 134 in 2011 among 187 countries in terms of the UNDP Human Development Index ( HDI ) and Gender Inequality Index ( GII ) . 
This is indefensible - especially as the Founding Fathers of our Constitution had been unambiguous in their commitment to the equality of women . 
The principle of gender equality is enshrined in our Preamble , Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles . 
There is no room for complacency . 
To ensure a safe and secure environment for women in their workplaces , the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace ( Prevention , Prohibition and Redressal ) Bill , 2013 has been passed by Parliament . 
The Government also intends to constitute a Rs . 1000 crore fund called the " Nirbhaya Fund” to support initiatives for the protection of women in all spheres of life . 
On the recommendations of the Justice J . S . Verma Committee , the Government has promulgated an ordinance , amending the criminal law to provide for stringent punishment for heinous sexual offences against women . 
However , legislation will become effective only if they are supported by efficient enforcement mechanisms . 
Reforms in police and judiciary need to be taken up on a continuing basis and in all earnest , so that women get fair and prompt justice . 
These measures need to be further backed by efforts aimed at empowerment of women and improvement of their health , education and employment opportunities . 
Disparities in gender that persist in our society can be demolished only through pro - active intervention in the building of adequate social and physical infrastructure and improving women’s participation in governance at all levels . 
I would like to remember , in this context , the words of Gandhiji who said , " Woman is the companion of man , gifted with equal mental capacities . 
She has the right to participate in the minutest details in the activities of man , and she has equal right to liberty of freedom and liberty with him . 
We , as a nation should be guided by these words . 
We should consciously invest in the future of the women of India . 
Women achievers have continuously left their footprints on the sands of time in our country . 
From the days of our freedom struggle and especially today , an impressive number of women have inspired many others by their achievements - borne of their courage and determination to succeed . 
Rural women have scripted their success stories by participating in Panchayat elections , far exceeding their 33 % quota . 
They have taken advantage of micro - finance initiatives - implemented in self - help groups . 
It is heartening to see that there has been an upward trend in control and management and in the collective decision - making in these Groups . 
India will also have its first Bank dedicated only to women . 
Empowerment of women must be regarded as not only an element of our efforts towards gender equality but also a critical step for stimulating their full participation in nation building . 
Swami Vivekananda was of the view that the best barometer of the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women . 
He said , all nations have attained greatness by paying proper respect to women . 
That country and that nation which do not respect women have never become great , nor will ever be in future . 
I call upon all citizens of India to persevere , in their respective spheres , for the comprehensive implementation , in letter and in spirit , of the constitutional rights guaranteed to every woman in India . 
I compliment all the award winners for the excellent work done by them and the Ministry of Women and Child Development for organizing this event . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The State Banquet hosted by The Prime Minister of The Republic of Mauritius , H . E . Dr . Navinchandra Ramgoolam
Distinguished Guests , Friends , Ladies and Gentlemen , it is a singular honour and privilege to address this distinguished gathering on the eve of the 45th Anniversary of the Independence of Mauritius . 
I extend to the Government and the people of Mauritius , warm greetings and good wishes on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of India . 
I would also like to convey my sincere gratitude for the exceptionally warm welcome and hospitality accorded to me and to my delegation today . 
I thank you for your kind words and agree with your remarks that India and Mauritius share a unique relationship . 
I am also very happy to see that we stand in a hall named after Swami Vivekananda , whose message of tolerance , compassion and understanding remains universally relevant today . 
There are few events in a nation ' s history that compel greater remembrance , tribute , solemnity , introspection and indeed more celebration than the commemoration of its Independence . 
My thoughts go to the period when India won her freedom in 1947 after a prolonged valiant struggle and courageous sacrifice . 
Our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had gloriously remarked in Parliament " A moment comes , which comes but rarely in history , when we step out from the old to the new , when an age ends , and when the soul of a nation , long suppressed , finds utterance " . 
Mauritius had her own architects of freedom , outstanding men and women ; steeled by moral conviction and unfazed by the odds that they were up against . 
Among them , none stood taller than Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam , the Father of the Mauritian nation . 
Chacha Ramgoolam seized the essence of the struggle of his countrymen and women when he said - 
The natural evolution of a people cannot be thwarted . 
That will be accomplished naturally as day follows night . 
The indelible mark of Chacha Ramgoolam ' s vision can be seen today in the impressive progress achieved by this country over the last 45 years , most visibly in the crucial areas of education and health which are the cornerstones of a stable and prosperous society . 
The contribution of visionary Mauritian leaders have transformed this nation ' s destiny in a relatively short period of time . 
On a historic occasion as this , it is incumbent upon us to pay tribute to the legacy of those whose sacrifices paved the road to the freedom that is enjoyed here today . 
Ladies and Gentlemen For India , Mauritius symbolises the very triumph of its own civilisational ethos and character . 
The remarkable socio - economic progress attained by Mauritius exemplifies the victory of the principles that India holds dear to her soul - democracy , rule of law , freedom of expression , tolerance , social harmony and human enterprise . 
The people of India appreciate the tribute paid by the people of Mauritius to the Father of the Indian Nation , Mahatma Gandhi in selecting March 12 - the day Mahatma Gandhi began his iconic Dandi March - as the Independence Day of Mauritius . 
Both our peoples are drawn largely from the same historical , cultural and spiritual provenance . 
Both nations have abiding faith in the ideals of democracy and secularism and both nations intuitively advocate a rule - based architecture of global governance as a bulwark against common challenges such as the threat of terrorism , tackling poverty , human rights abuse , and addressing climate change . 
It is thus no wonder that the relationship between India and Mauritius has an unwavering vitality . 
Forged in the resilience of the thousands of brave men and women who were brought here to toil on sugarcane fields , and drawing inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi ' s epochal and transformative stopover in 1901 , our partnership has grown in spirit and substance with each passing year . 
Regular high - level political interaction has been a hallmark of the Indo - Mauritian bilateral relationship . 
From the days of Seewoosagur Ramgoolam and Smt . Indira Gandhi , regular bilateral contact at the highest level have nourished and guided this partnership well into the 21st century . 
Our cooperation encompasses diverse areas of mutual interest including Trade and Investment , Education , ICT , Renewable Energy , Textiles , Science and Technology , Mutual Legal Assistance , Cultural Exchanges , etc . 
Tomorrow we will discuss how to further enhance this vibrant and mutually beneficial cooperation . Myriad people - to - people contacts are the lifeblood of our friendship . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , For several millennia , the Indian Ocean has been a key arbiter of the subcontinent ' s fortunes . 
You are the proverbial Star and Key of the Indian Ocean . Naturally we have a convergence of interests as the Indian ocean straddles Asia and Africa . 
Let me assure you that India will remain a steadfast partner of Mauritius . 
Mr . Prime Minister , we are grateful to Mauritius for standing by us on issues of great importance to India . 
Mauritius has been steadfast in its support of India ' s principled , moral and consistent stand on the issue of terrorism . 
We are grateful for your support for India ' s rightful claim to Permanent Membership of the United Nations Security Council . 
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen , our bilateral economic and commercial relations have grown in recent years but there still remain areas of untapped potential
India and Mauritius must to explore new avenues and opportunities to enhance and enrich our engagement even further for our mutual benefit . 
To the communities of Indian origin I extend my felicitations and say to them that India is blessed with a diaspora that mirrors India ' s own rich diversity . 
Enriched by diverse linguistic , cultural and religious identities of India you have contributed immensely to the nation - building process of this land , too , making India equally proud of you and your achievements as citizens of this great country . 
Excellency , I thank you once again for the honour you have accorded me by inviting me to be Chief Guest at your Independence Day celebrations . 
I speak for all Indians when I say that we cherish our close ties with Mauritius . 
We see in you a trusted partner in realising our shared vision of stability , peace and prosperity in this region and the world . 
We look forward to working together with you to achieve the full potential of our partnership . 
I truly believe that there can be no limit to our success in every sphere . 
Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen , may I request you to join me in raising a toast : 
- to the health and happiness of Dr . Navinchandra Ramgoolam , Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius and Mrs . Ramgoolam ; 
- to the continued success , prosperity and well - being of the Mauritian people ; and
- to the enduring , successful partnership between India and the friendly Republic of Mauritius . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The Ceremony Conferring Honorary Degree of Doctor of Civil Law by The University of Mauritius
I am delighted to be here among you . 
I have been in your country for nearly two days now . 
I have been mesmerised by the natural beauty of this island which is rivalled only by the warmth and friendliness of its people . 
I have been touched by the gracious hospitality accorded to me . 
I am , above all , struck by the profound awareness that this island ' s success is vested , in large part , in the education of its citizens . 
Mahatma Gandhi ' s brief stopover in 1901 had set the stage for a peaceful revolution in the area of education in Mauritius . 
Nurtured by the efforts of Barrister Manilall Doctor and other stalwarts , the seeds of social transformation continued to grow after Independence , thanks to the visionary leadership of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam , who was deeply aware of the power of education . 
He had said and I quote " In the modern world , education has a vital role to play in the life of a nation , particularly in developing countries , where people are becoming more and more conscious of their duties and responsibilities in shaping the future of their countries " - words which ring true even today . 
Investment in education continues to reap rich dividends for Mauritius and has been one of the reasons for the praiseworthy level of development that we see in Mauritius today . 
Excellency , Sir Ramesh Jeewoolall , Chancellor of the University of Mauritius , it is indeed a privilege to receive the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Civil Law from your esteemed University . 
I thank you for this high honour . 
This University has a rich tradition of providing quality education that responds responding to the contemporary needs of Mauritian society . 
I wish all its distinguished faculty members , scholars and students every success in their academic pursuits . 
May you achieve , with distinction , your motto of " bridging knowledge across continents through excellence and intellectual creativity " . 
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen , I am especially happy to be here as Chief Guest for the 45th Anniversary of the Independence Day of Mauritius . 
On this occasion , I extend to all Mauritians the good wishes of the Government and the people of India . 
While enjoying last evening ' s colourful and dignified ceremony at the Anjalay stadium , I could not help marvelling at the long way that Mauritius has come - since its independence in 1968 . 
Every Mauritian , regardless of his ethnic or religious background should be proud of the remarkable achievements of this country . 
Not only has Mauritius triumphed in the realisation of its democratic and secular ideals , but it has also registered a commendable rate of economic growth , and established for its citizens the strong institutions that make Mauritius a well integrated and progressive people . 
Today Mauritius figures high in economic and social development indicators in Africa and has become a role model to many countries because of its economic success story . 
During my visit to your country , I have had the opportunity to review the entire canvas of our bilateral co - operation with President Purryag , Prime Minister Ramgoolam and other distinguished leaders . 
All of us place great value on the unique bilateral relationship between India and Mauritius and agree that the friendship and trust between our governments and our people is based on enduring ties of kinship and brotherhood , our common history and culture and our shared vision for the future . 
In recent years , we have been able to leverage these linkages to evolve a modern , dynamic and mutually beneficial partnership , guided by close and frequent high - level political interaction - and strengthened by robust people - to - people contacts . 
The abiding strength of our bilateral partnership is amply reflected in close and strong engagement at various levels . 
I am happy to note that several agreements have been signed during my visit in key sectors of our respective economies including tourism , health and medicine , co - operation in the addressing the issues related to senior citizens and disabilities . 
These agreements reflect the diversity of our engagement and will definitely benefit the people of both countries . 
India has the third largest higher education system in the world with hundreds of universities , thousands of tertiary education institutions and millions of students studying in colleges and universities . 
We have a highly developed curriculum , globally reputed for its high quality - particularly in engineering , medicine , management , material science and technology , nanoscience , remote sensing , environmental studies , renewable energy and space science to name a few . 
With over 600 million Indians below the age of 25 , we have prioritised the education and training of our youth over the next two decades to carry forward our development agenda . 
Needless to say , India is committing huge resources to towards this end . 
Distinguished Ladies and gentlemen , cooperation in the field of education has always been an important dimension of our bilateral relations . 
Nearly 100 scholarships are offered annually to Mauritian students to pursue under - graduate , post - graduate and research studies in various streams in India . 
This is in addition to 290 slots for short term courses under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation ( ITEC ) programme . 
In recent years , we have seen an upswing in the number of Mauritian students availing of these scholarships . 
Many Mauritian students also enrol themselves in Indian universities on a self - financing basis . 
We welcome them in India . As the next generation , young people should have a say in determining our responses to the variety of challenges that our developing nations face today . 
I recall the words of Gandhiji who said , about living and learning , " Live as if you were to die tomorrow . Learn as if you were to live forever . ”
I hope these words inspire you too . 
I once again thank the University of Mauritius once for receiving me and I wish you all great success in the future . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of the colors presentation to The Air Force Central Medical Establishment and No . 3 Base Repair Depot
I am happy to be present here today at this premiere Maintenance Depot of the Indian Air Force to award Colours to Air Force Central Medical Establishment and 3 Base Repair Depot . 
Both these establishments have distinguished themselves in the service of the nation . 
They have a rich history of professional excellence and have served the nation with honour and distinction . 
For their devotion , professionalism and exceptional service , the nation honours them today , by awarding them Colours . 
This is an expression of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional services they have rendered the nation . 
I compliment the fraternity of Air Force Central Medical Establishment and 3 Base Repair Depot for this recognition . 
As the proud guardian of our sovereign skies , the Indian Air Force has been discharging its duty with fortitude . 
The brave air warriors have been engaged in undertaking a whole range of crucial missions for the nation . 
They range from disaster relief operations to supporting counter - insurgency operations . 
As our country moves ahead on the path of economic progress . 
It is essential to preserve peace for which we need to maintain an effective deterrence and a strong defence capability . 
As a nation , we are fully committed to maintaining peace and we are steadfast in our belief that the resolution of disputes should be through discussion . 
But at the same time , we would need to be prepared to face any aggression and safeguard our territorial integrity with all our might , and the Indian Air Force has a critical role to play in this effort . 
They have in the past risen admirably in defence of our nation with valour , courage , devotion and fearlessness . 
The men and women , who stand before me today , are the proud sons and daughters of mother India . 
They have vowed to lay down their lives for the defence of our motherland and thus symbolize patriotism of the most noble kind . 
They uphold the highest standards of the defence forces and I congratulate them for their devotion and discipline . 
I also take this opportunity to congratulate the air warriors on parade today , for the exemplary impeccable drill , turnout and discipline . 
The Air Force Central Medical Establishment is a premier medical establishment of the Indian Air Force . 
The unit was first established by the Royal Air Force as the Central Medical Board at Lahore in 1940 . 
The creation of the establishment was a recognition of a necessity for standardized procedures for selection and subsequent medical assessment of aircrew . 
The primary role of the organization is to provide comprehensive medical assessment of aircrew of the armed forces , paramilitary services and the civil aviation industry . 
The unit personnel , both past and present , have relentlessly pursued excellence and have set standards that are worthy of emulation . 
I am happy to note that in 2005 , the unit achieved the rare distinction of becoming the first unit in the Armed Forces medical services to acquire an ISO 9001 : 2000 certification . 
The unit has achieved excellence in providing quality aero - medical care and continues to set higher benchmarks through perseverance and hard work . 
I am confident that the unit will continue to serve the nation selflessly in the years to come . 
No . 3 Base Repair Depot has completed fifty glorious years of service to the nation . 
I am happy to know that ever since its inception in 1962 , the Depot has discharged its duty zealously and functioned as a major repair and maintenance support unit of the Indian Air Force . 
The role that they play in the defence preparedness of nation cannot be exaggerated . 
Nations may have the most sophisticated platforms , but their effective deployment will hinge on the quality of repairs and maintenance of aircraft and their various equipment . 
With increasing sophistication of aircraft and their avionics , the role of repair and support organizations has become more critical than ever . 
er . The aircraft that we can deploy and their lethality will depend on the efficiency of such organizations . 
The No . 3 BRD has distinguished themselves in playing this crucial role in 1965 and 1971 when the nation was compelled to defend itself . 
Besides playing the crucial role of repair and support , the 3BRD has several other achievements to its credit . 
The BRD has undertaken successfully the difficult task of life revision of aero engines without involving the original manufacturer relying on indigenous technology . 
Many contemporary technologies have been utilized on helicopters and aero engines for the first time in the country at 3 BRD , and this has substantially contributed towards minimizing our dependency on foreign sources . 
The Depot continues to strive to attain complete self - reliance in helicopter maintenance and provide quality maintenance support to the field units . 
I have been informed that the Depot is presently handling the induction of newly acquired state - of - the - art Mi - 17 V5 helicopters and has also been designated as its major overhaul agency , a task which I am confident it will execute with remarkable professionalism and commitment . 
In acknowledgement and recognition of the outstanding performance , I am pleased to award Colours to Air Force Central Medical Establishment and 3 Base Repair Depot . 
On this occasion , I take the opportunity to acknowledge and compliment the contribution and sacrifice of all the personnel and their families , past and present , of the two establishments , for their dedication , devotion and service to the nation . 
The nation is indeed proud of you . 
I wish you and your families the very best and a glorious future . 
We are indeed proud of you and your achievements . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of The 33rd Annual Convocation of The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research
I am happy to be here at the 33rd Annual Convocation of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research at Chandigarh . 
The last time that I had the opportunity to attend the Annual Convocation of PGI was in 2008 , when I was the Union Minister of External Affairs . 
I am delighted to be back once again after 5 years , on the Golden Jubilee Anniversary of the foundation of PGI . 
The PGIMER came into existence in 1962 thanks to the wisdom and foresight of Sardar Partap Singh Kairon , the then Chief Minister of Punjab and the hospital was inaugurated by Pandit Nehru . 
This Institute was established as a center of excellence to develop postgraduate medical education in as many branches as possible and produce specialists in several disciplines of medicine . 
The basic idea was that these specialists would spread out across the country to various medical colleges and institutions and in turn , set up a nucleus of excellence in each of these institutions . 
It is a matter of pride that PGI alumni can be found today in all parts of the country and the institution is known for its comprehensive facilities for teaching , research and patient care . 
I compliment all those who have been associated with the establishment and growth of this great institution . 
PGI’s Mission Speech " Service to the community , care of the needy and research for the good of all” sums up the important role that the Institute is playing in the Health Care Sector in India . 
The mission of PGIMER and similar institutes of excellence would remain incomplete unless the interests of the common man is taken care of . 
It is only when the life of the villager living in the remote districts of India is touched by your research and the most underprivileged child in your ward goes back home satisfied with your care , that you will know that your mission has been truly accomplished . 
Good health of its people is the very foundation of a nation . 
A person who is not healthy is unable to access opportunities for learning , growth and productive work . 
In India , a number of rights are guaranteed to its citizens but none of these can be utilized or enforced by persons who are sick , enfeebled and spend their entire energy on treatment and medical care . 
At the national level , according to a WHO study , the estimated economic loss for India due to deaths caused by all the diseases in 2005 was 1 . 3 % of its GDP . 
With an increase in the number of non - communicable diseases , this loss is apprehended to increase to 5 % of GDP by 2015 if it is not checked . 
Our medical healthcare system has to be developed to cater to medical requirements of all sections of society , both in rural and urban areas . 
A good healthcare system would need to be country - specific , and therefore , India would need to look at achieving universal health coverage based on its own perspective and requirements , while bearing in mind the lessons that can be drawn from the experiences of others . 
Medicines account for 72 % of private expenditure of health . 
India has taken a major decision on distribution of free generic drugs to patients seeking healthcare in public facilities . 
This will bring down out - of - pocket expenditure and provide affordable access to medicine , particularly for the poor and disadvantaged . 
Implementing this requires funds as also efficient management systems . 
In today ' s era technology based initiatives including telemedicine can be employed to broaden the reach of healthcare . 
The Government is looking at scaling up expenditure of health from the current level to 2 . 5 % of GDP by 2017 i . e the end of 12th Plan and 3 % by 2022 i . e end of 13th Plan . 
The Government , singularly , cannot be a provider of healthcare . 
While the aim is to strengthen the public healthcare sector , we should look at ways to encourage cooperation between the public and private sectors in achieving the health goals
All stakeholders have to be a part of the effort to provide universal healthcare . 
From the pharmacists to the doctors , from industry to drug manufacturers , from medical insurance to management of hospitals and running of primary health centres , all have a role in the success of the health system . 
The potential of India as centre for medical research and innovation given its academic , scientific , technical and industrial capabilities should be fully explored . 
It will be incorrect if we were to look at health coverage only in terms of curative and interventionist approach . 
Preventive healthcare is equally important particularly in India where the number of those suffering from diabetes and cardio - vascular diseases is on the rise . 
Our health system , therefore , will need to treat people and , at the same time , advise and guide them about how to deal with and prevent some of these medical conditions . 
Hygiene and sanitation are basic for preventing diseases . 
In these efforts , participation at the local level particularly at the village level through Panchayati Raj Institutions can ensure effective implementation . 
The transformation of India ' s health system to be able to provide universal health coverage is a process that will span a period of time . 
A major re - engineering process began with National Rural Health Mission , launched in 2005 . 
It sought to extend healthcare services to every village in the country and to strengthen healthcare infrastructure through sub - centres , primary health centres and community health centres . 
The aim now is to extend the coverage to urban areas also . 
There should be necessary standards of care observed at every level of healthcare . 
A network of healthcare centres has to be established . 
This can be sustained only with adequate number of doctors and other paramedical supporting staff . 
Merely constructing hospitals is not enough . 
It needs the human resources to make them functional and effective . 
Medical colleges , nursing institutions , and training schools for paramedical professions would need to be augmented substantially . 
Shortage of trained medical personnel can be a major constraint for providing universal healthcare . 
Progress in the health sector is key to India ' s future prominence in the world . A nation ' s productivity depends on the health and well - being of its citizens . 
Economic growth that does not go hand in hand with reduction in avoidable mortality and ill health is neither sustainable nor desirable . 
Provision of universal health care is therefore a matter of faith for the Government . 
For this , the public health system must be greatly expanded and strengthened across the Nation . 
We need many more nurses , doctors , paramedics and health workers . 
We need to decentralize planning and implementation of healthcare to the district and sub - district levels . 
We need to take health services closer to the homes of the families - even a primary health centre is too far by today ' s standard and need . 
We need out of the box managerial and administrative reforms in the health departments at the state and central level . 
We need public health professionals to spearhead public health programs . 
We need to develop effective models of healthcare for the ever - increasing urban population . 
India ' s national health system must be a strong , sensitive and efficient public health system . 
I call upon all stakeholders to join hands to build a solid consensus for a historic transformation of India ' s health sector in the coming years . 
The PGI is a living tribute to the faculty , staff and students who have , over the years , worked selflessly to bring the Institute to its present position of pre - eminence . 
The PGI must rise to be one of the top medical universities in the world within a specific period of time . 
This target is ambitious but I am confident the faculty , the students and the staff can together achieve this . 
We must develop world class centres of excellence focused not only on traditional specialties but also on cross - cutting themes such as infectious diseases , vaccine development and regenerative sciences . 
I call upon the faculty and scholars of PGI to step forward and become leaders in the world of medicine . 
The government will support you in this endeavour in every possible way . 
I wish all the graduating students and awardees the very best in their future endeavours . 
I urge you to dedicate yourselves to the service of the nation and your countrymen . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inauguration of The Golden Jubilee Celebrations of The government T . D . Medical College
It gives me great pleasure to be present here today to inaugurate the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the Government T . D . Medical College . 
This Medical College is located in the town of Alappuzha known as the ‘Venice of the East’ . 
During the five decades of its existence , this College has been instrumental in providing quality medical education in Kerala . 
The T . D . Medical College has produced over 4 , 200 doctors , who are in the service of needy patients in India and abroad . 
It is a matter of pride that the alumni of this College have excelled in various fields of medical education , patient care and research , both nationally and internationally . 
I am happy to note that a series of academic , health awareness and patient care programmes have been planned for this Golden Jubilee year , to reach out to the needy and to provide them with free medical care . 
This Medical College is also the main agency through which various health and family welfare schemes of the Government are implemented in this district . 
I am told that an initiative has been launched to make Alappuzha the first self - sufficient district in Kerala in the field of health care . 
The high standard of public health in Kerala is known to all . 
The State has always been proactive in implementing national programmes for control and eradication of diseases . 
The family welfare programme , universal immunization programme and maternal and child health activities have helped the State reach global benchmarks in the health status of its citizens . 
The infant mortality rate is 12 per 1000 live births , while the maternal mortality rate is 81 per 1 lakh live births , which are much below the national average . 
Kerala is a big contributor to the pool of health care professionals , particularly doctors and nurses , in the country . 
It is a leader amongst Indian states in terms of human development , with the highest literacy rate of around 94 per cent and highest sex ratio of 1 , 084 females per 1 , 000 males in the country . 
The Kerala model of social development , where the Government initiatives are matched by active civic participation , is indeed laudable . 
The well being of a nation is dependent on the well being of its people . 
Unless the health of the population is secured , the productive potential of the country cannot be realized to the full extent . 
A sound health care system depends on the three pillars of availability , quality and affordability . 
The National Rural Health Mission was launched in 2005 to address these parameters in our health sector . 
I am happy to note that a new National Health Mission , combining the rural mission and a new urban mission , is being launched with an outlay of over Rs . 21 , 000 crore for 2013 - 14 . 
Despite the progress made in our health care system , we still have great distance to cover . 
The public sector health service in our country is limited by its reach . 
Many in our population are dependent on the private sector for delivery of health services . 
It is burdensome for poor people to access expensive medical treatment , and many fall into the trap of poverty on account of that . 
The quality of health care delivery by some of the health service providers also leave much to be desired . 
We must correct this situation by expanding good quality affordable public sector health care facilities . 
Our public expenditure on health care was 1 . 04 per cent of GDP during the Eleventh Five Year Plan period . 
This should rise to 2 . 5 per cent of GDP by the end of the Twelfth Plan period if we are to augment public health care in the country in a big way . 
Augmenting public resources will by itself not automatically translate into expansion of health care infrastructure unless there is adequate number of competent health care professionals to serve this sector . 
There were about 241 medical professionals – physicians , dentists , nurses , pharmacists and other professionals – per one lakh population in 2011 - 12 . 
It is envisaged that this density of medical professionals will increase to 354 by the end of the Twelfth Five Year Plan period . 
There is urgent need for more institutes of learning for imparting medical education . 
It is gratifying to note that six AIIMS like institutions are to be set up soon . 
It is also necessary to increase the capacity of our existing medical schools and nursing colleges and enhance the standard of education in them . 
I am confident that our public sector medical colleges will meet the twin challenge of greater quantity and better quality . 
No one should be denied specialty medical treatment due to high costs . 
We must strengthen the mechanism of health insurance . 
he Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana that gives beneficiaries cash less in - patient treatment should provide access to comprehensive primary , secondary and tertiary medical care . 
The benefits of this scheme should touch every one below the poverty line . 
Most new initiatives are now driven by technology . India is a global leader in information and communication technology . 
Taking advantage of this , we must build an efficient health information system for universal registration of births and deaths , nutritional surveillance and disease surveillance . 
A sound data base should come handy for our policy makers to make timely interventions . 
Satellite - based technology has made it possible for health care to reach the remotest parts of our country . 
The tele - medicine project has enabled remotely - located health care centres to interact with super specialty hospitals in urban centres for provision of health care consultation to the needy and under - served population . 
We have envisaged infant mortality rate to reduce from 44 per 1000 live births to 25 by the end of the Twelfth Plan period , and the maternal mortality rate to reduce from 212 per one lakh live births to 100 during this period . 
These targets are within our reach but for that comprehensive efforts are essential . 
A sustainable model of health care with the participation of all stakeholders is the need of the hour . 
I hope the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the T . D . Medical College will be a platform for exchange of ideas on the issues I have outlined above . 
I am confident the T . D . Medical college will continue to render outstanding service to society and that your efforts will touch and transform the lives of many people . 
I wish the year - long celebrations organized by the College all the success . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of 125th Anniversary Celebration of The Malayala Manorama
It gives me great pleasure to be in Kottayam to inaugurate the 125th Anniversary celebrations of Malayala Manorama , one of the great newspapers of India . 
I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to Shri Mammen Mathew and all members of the Malayala Manorama Group on attaining this major milestone in its journey . 
In the last 125 years , the Manorama has reported on colonialism giving way to independence , self - sufficiency replacing hunger and deprivation , political emancipation evolving into a strong , mature democracy and the emergence of India as a major political and economic force in the world . 
Over the years , the Manorama has not just chronicled India’s amazing journey , it has also been an active participant in the process of bringing significant change in our country . 
I am happy to know that the Malayala Manorama which started with less than a thousand copies is now published from 18 centres including 2 centres abroad and has a circulation of 21 . 29 lakhs with around 97 . 52 lakh readers . 
Started in 1888 , in this small town of Kottayam , Malayala Manorama is now an international media brand with a notable presence in the cyber world and electronic media . 
Manorama now reaches the drawing room of Malayalam readers across the world and Manorama publications come out in various languages including I believe the YEAR BOOK which has a Bengali version . 
Kerala has been a pioneer and a path - breaker in many fields . 
Near universal literacy and enrolment in schools has been achieved . 
Fertility rate of its people has declined below replacement level . 
The overall sex ratio is in favour of women and women enjoy higher life expectancy than men . Infant and maternal morality is low . 
All these together have been described as the ‘Kerala Model’ and the Malayala Manorama has not just reported on the emergence of this phenomenon , it has also directly contributed to the extraordinary success of the state in the field of human development by spreading literacy , inculcating a passion for reading and launching various social movements under its auspices . 
In fact , the social commitment and vision of Malayala Manorama is evident from the fact that its first editorial was on the demand for education of ‘Pulayas’ , a community of untouchables , who were not allowed to walk on public roads in those days . 
Manorama has always stood for the people and with the people in the battle against injustice and for freedom and equality . 
It is praiseworthy that in 45 days Manorama readers contributed Rs . 2 . 39 crores for rebuilding of Banegaon village in Latur after the earthquake . 
I believe this is the largest collection for relief work initiated by a newspaper in India . 
This shows that Manorama ' s care for the society is not limited to Kerala alone but extends to whole of India . 
The Malayalam language owes a great deal to the crusading zeal of Malayala Manorama . 
Along with other newspapers , the Manorama led the way in developing a common script for printing and dissemination of the language . 
The Newspaper and its distinguished sister publication , Bhashaposhini have been a nursery for great thinkers and poets of Kerala . 
I am also delighted to know that it was the Malayala Manorama , which first published the poems of my illustrious predecessor Dr . K . R . Narayanan during his student days . 
The Manorama played a stellar role in our freedom movement , for which it suffered at the hands of then rulers . 
The newspaper was shut down for nine years but its management and staff refused to bow down or compromise on their ideals . 
Through its silent sacrifice , the newspaper became a symbol of our nations’ struggle for freedom and basic liberties . 
In our country , freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution and the influence , credibility and quality of our media is well recognized . 
However , freedom of expression can not be guaranteed only by legal rights and enactment . 
A conducive atmosphere must be created for the purpose and this can be done if we remember Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore’s words " where knowledge is free " and " where words come out from the depths of truth " . 
The media has an important role to play in cleansing public life . 
However , to undertake this role the conduct of the media itself should be above board . 
It must be always kept in mind that ends and means are both important . 
The highest standards of ethics must be maintained at all times . 
Sensationalism should never become a substitute for objective assessment and truthful reporting . Gossip and speculation should not replace hard facts . 
Every effort should be made to ensure that political or commercial interests are not passed off as legitimate and independent opinion . 
Integrity and independence are two sides of the same coin and both must be equally important for our media and for every one of us . 
There should be recognition that the media is accountable to its readers and viewers at large and through them to the entire nation . 
Newspapers like Malayala Manorama , which had the benefit of leadership from several generations of luminaries like Kandathil Varghese Mapillai , K . C . Mammen Mapillai , K . M . Cherian and K . M . Mathew play a major role in shaping the values in journalism and of our society . 
In his Sacred Trust , Shri Mammen Mapillai told his sons and the entire Malayala Manorama family : 
Manorama is a sacred public trust or an institution God has bestowed upon us to be used without fear or favour from anyone . 
You should always work with this in mind . God has placed in our hands a mighty weapon . 
To use it for our personal , vindictive and vitriolic ends will be an unpardonable and immoral act injurious to the faith bestowed on us by a large number of people . 
God does not want that . And hence our eternal vow should be to tirelessly work for the success of fairness , justice and morality . 
If these words were true then , it is true now and will remain true in future . 
There can be no better mission for a news organization than what Shri Mapillai said more than half a century ago . 
Today Malayala Manorama stands as an outstanding example of quality and principled journalism . 
I am confident that the present leadership and the whole family of Malayala Manorama will continue to discharge this sacred Trust in letter and spirit . 
While both the Manorama and the people of Kerala have much to be proud about , there is little room for complacency . 
Society in Kerala continues to face a number of challenges . 
There is need for industrialization and rapid creation of jobs . 
Kerala’s infrastructure requires to be significantly improved . 
The remittance revenue from non - resident Keralites has to be channelized into long term development activities . 
The public need to be educated on how to avoid life style diseases like diabetes , mental illness , depression etc . 
Adequate provision needs to be made for the care of the elderly , whose numbers are rapidly growing . 
Issues of urbanization such as waste management and disposal need to be addressed with a sense of urgency . 
Atrocities against women needs to be tackled with a stern hand . 
There is need to find innovative solutions and new methods of mobilizing society for collective welfare as Kerala prepares to address these new challenges . 
I am confident the Manorama Group will play its due role in this regard . 
I once again congratulate Malayala Manorama for its 125 years of public service , and wish the organization every success in the future
May you continue to serve the people of India with strength , vigour and dedication . 
May your columns give voice to the voiceless and unorganized sectors . 
May you stand tall as a pillar that supports our democratic political system and be a guiding light for the society and leadership . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the first convocation of The Indian Institute of Management ( IIM ) , Kashipur
It is indeed a pleasant and privileged occasion for me to join you on the occasion of the first Convocation of the Indian Institute of Management ( IIM ) , Kashipur , which was founded three years back . 
As the first batch of 37 Post Graduate Programme students complete their management degree course today , the Institute should pride itself on crossing a major milestone since its inception . 
I congratulate the management and faculty whose undivided attention and profound dedication towards nursing this Institute in its nascent stage has been crucial for the management programmes to commence and gain momentum . 
I am very happy that IIM Lucknow played the role of a mentoring institution and I compliment the team from IIM Lucknow which was involved in the setting up of IIM Kashipur . 
As the youngest of IIMs , IIM Kashipur should strive to build a unique image for itself , while maintaining the high quality that IIMs are known for . 
I am happy to know that IIM Kashipur is considering the setting up two Centres of Excellence , on Sustainable Development and on Competitiveness . 
I am sure these Centres will stimulate new thinking , research and practice in their focus area . 
Many have felt the need for a renewed focus by our management institutions towards courses on entrepreneurship . 
At a time when IIM Kashipur is consolidating its course structure , it should leverage this opportunity and design management programmes in a manner that will become a model for others to follow . 
The unique geography of your Institute’s location , in an industrial belt surrendered by a predominantly rural area , provides you the opportunity to develop ‘extension education’ courses . 
Students should be encouraged as part of their academic curriculum to contribute to positive social development by helping people of the region learn better ways of running their farms , small businesses and other community ventures . 
This will instill in the students a sense of obligation to society , which they carry with them throughout their professional lives . 
I am confident of your Institute becoming a premier source for highly trained managers , a catalyst of entrepreneurship , and a resource hub for socio - economic development . 
We need a strategy to make the Indian Industry compete successfully with the best in the world . 
Skilled manpower has to play a key role in this strategy . A healthy growth of Indian business will be greatly facilitated by the availability of a competent cadre of management professionals . 
The pool of such professionals in our country is unfortunately not enough to meet the needs of our industry . 
The annual enrolment in commerce and management streams has increased from around 23 lakh in 2006 - 07 to around 34 lakh in 2011 - 12 . 
The need for graduates and post - graduates from these streams will be much higher in the future and we must be ready to meet the demand . 
According to an international ranking of universities , no Indian university figures among the top 200 universities of the world . 
Our efforts must be aimed at taking Indian universities into the top - league . Innovation is also an important driver for growth . 
Unfortunately , we also lag behind our major competitors in this aspect . 
A culture of innovation must be encouraged in our country and for that , we must create more opportunities for collaborative research , set up industry incubation parks in educational institutions and provide more research fellowships . 
Technology - based learning has great potential to increase the reach of education on the one hand and deepen the learning experience of students on the other . 
Benefit to students would accrue from knowledge and information sharing enabled by collaboration with other institutes through e - classrooms . 
I am confident IIM Kashipur will be in the forefront of management education in the country . 
I have every confidence in your commitment and devotion and your ability to deliver quality management education . 
India today stands at the cusp of greatness - while there are many challenges ahead , there are also boundless opportunities . 
We are passing through a phase of unprecedented demographic change which is likely to contribute to a substantially increased labour force . 
The bulk of this increase is likely to take place in the relatively younger age group of 20 - 35 years which would make India one of the youngest nations in the world . 
In 2020 , the average Indian will be only 29 years old as compared to an average age of 37 for China and the US , 45 for West Europe and 48 for Japan . 
It is clear that the youth of India , who are the leaders of tomorrow , shall aspire for higher standards of living , better service delivery and increased transparency and accountability . 
For India’s political and economic stability , it is important that we have truly " inclusive” growth - growth that benefits each and every citizen of the country especially those who are at the margins of society and at the base of the socio - economic pyramid . 
The challenges being large and diverse , India needs grass - root leaders who place people and their problems at the centre of the social , economic and political discourse . 
It is only when we work together and each Indian feels empowered to contribute to the task of nation building that we shall be able to combat poverty , malnutrition , hunger and disease . 
I call upon the faculty and students of IIM Kashipur to focus on the problems of the bottom of the pyramid and develop innovative solutions to address their concerns . 
On the eve of India’s 66th Independence Day on August 14th last year , I had observed that the glass of modern India is more than half - full . 
I had said that we are equal children before our mother ; and India asks each one of us , in whatever role we play in the complex drama of nation building , to do our duty with integrity , commitment and unflinching loyalty to the values enshrined in our Constitution . 
If each of us follows this principle , I am confident that India will become a more vibrant , dynamic and prosperous nation . 
Dear students , the role played by alumni in the growth of leading universities across the world is well acknowledged . 
Alumni are active participants in the affairs of top universities in the US including Harvard . 
I hope that the students , who are passing out of this Institute today , and the others to follow in the future , will associate with their alma mater and contribute to its development in a meaningful and significant way . 
As you step into the professional world , you must remember that the potential for learning is never exhausted . 
Education is a life - long process . 
I hope that your studies here would have inspired you to seek knowledge at every stage in your career . 
I wish you good luck in your endeavours and the management and faculty of IIM Kashipur every success in the years to come . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of The Presentation of The National Tourism Awards
It is indeed a pleasure to join you in recognizing those who have made an outstanding contribution to the promotion of India as a tourist destination . 
Today , our tourism industry has commendably expanded its operations and range of offerings . 
India has welcomed about 6 . 65 million foreign tourists last year . 
This denotes a growth of 5 . 4 % in such arrivals over the previous year . 
oreign exchange earnings in this segment of our economy are estimated to be about Rs . 94 , 500 crores for 2012 . 
This , too , is a significant - 21 . 8 % increase over the previous year . 
It is also interesting to see how India’s domestic demand for tourism has developed . 
The increase in disposable incomes of Indian citizens have given them an increasing capacity for leisure travel . 
There is also an abundance of attractive offers , new and improved air and rail connections and a general expansion of the tourism infrastructure in all States of India . 
Its multiplier effect has been strong and has led to creation of jobs in the primary , secondary and tertiary sectors . 
For this , a great amount of the credit is due to the initiatives of the Union Government and the State Governments to invigorate our tourism infrastructure and improve the facilities offered to the foreign and domestic tourist . 
The " Incredible India” campaign was , by all standards , a well - conceived and concerted effort in brand promotion . 
The diverse and unique aspects of all that is offered by the different States of India have been projected in a single , successful campaign . 
New categories of awards will promote India as a year - round destination . 
They will encourage States and Union Territories to develop effective mechanisms for maintaining cleanliness and safeguarding heritage spots . 
I take this opportunity to stress the importance of a highly specialized and motivated work force . 
It is important for Government and private sector to collectively generate adequate manpower – both in terms of quantity and quality . 
One of the most attractive assets that India can offer is our cuisine . 
There is no parallel to the range of local specialties that a traveller can savour as he travels through India . 
Due attention to safety and quality standards would instill more confidence in the foreign as well as domestic tourists . 
I am informed that Government will soon open an institute of excellence for culinary specialization and research . 
I wish them all success in this endeavour . 
I would also stress the need to ensure that every aspect of our infrastructure responds to the expectations of the best traveled tourists . 
A visit to a world renowned heritage site can be marred by poor approach roads or the absence of public facilities en route or by unpleasant sights and odours . 
The campaign , " Clean India” launched by the Ministry of Tourism to promote cleanliness and hygiene and the " Atithidevo Bhava” campaign are good initiatives . 
I would also like to stress the importance of sustainable , " green” tourism . 
To this end , I call upon host communities to be more conscious and proactive with regard to tourist destinations in their respective areas . 
Hotels , museums and monuments should consciously reduce their use of energy and water . 
They should consciously try to reduce generation of waste . 
Transportation , heating , cooling , washing and lighting could be made ‘greener’ . 
Visitors themselves should be reminded to be more mindful . 
They should be encouraged and assisted in safeguarding the facilities that they use for future travellers . 
Co - operation , rather than competition , between organizations in the tourism industry could help to develop socially responsible products . 
I have no doubt , whatsoever , that we are generally on the right path , but we need to update and upgrade constantly . 
With these words , I commend those who have succeeded in identifying opportunities and swiftly realizing their tourism potential . 
I congratulate the Ministry of Tourism for instituting the National Tourism Awards , and those who have received these awards . 
I take this opportunity to wish each of you great success in your daily efforts and your future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of The 90th Convocation of The University of Delhi
It is indeed a privilege for me to be present here to deliver the 90th Convocation of the University of Delhi . 
I feel honoured to be at this Convocation , for which , in the past , some of India’s tallest leaders such as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Dr . S . Radhakrishnan have been Chief Guests . 
Delhi University is today a premier educational body of our country . 
Beginning with a small number of 250 students in 1922 , Delhi University has grown in status and eminence . 
It is now recognised both at home and abroad as a premier imparter of higher education catering to about 5 lakh students . 
By pursuing quality education , Delhi University has become a treasure house of knowledge . 
It is a reflection of its increasing eminence that it has had the privilege of honouring many eminent personalities of the likes of Madame Curie , Lord Mountbatten and Dr . Zakir Husain , a few among the many . 
On this 90th Convocation , I congratulate the University of Delhi for marking one more year of success in delivering meaningful , quality education . 
I have been informed that 400 doctoral , 6 , 500 post graduate and 65 , 000 graduate degrees will be awarded today to students in a variety of disciplines ranging from medicine to fine arts . 
I congratulate all the students on their achievements , and the University for providing them the opportunity to pursue their academic goals . 
I hardly need to emphasise that education plays a fundamental role in the development of a nation . 
True empowerment comes only with knowledge . 
If our country has to continue on its path of higher growth , then the relentless pursuit of higher educational standards is an indispensable requirement for its achievement . 
If we look at the statistics , the nation has been able to make remarkable progress in this direction . 
During the Eleventh Five Year Plan period , 65 new Central Institutions , including 21 Central Universities , were started and the number of Central Institutions increased by about 75 per cent . 
Except for one State , today there is now at least one Central University in every state of our country . 
But the question that we should now ask ourselves is whether we are satisfied with the progress that we are making in the educational sector . 
An honest answer would reveal that we have miles and miles to go before we can say that we have arrived . 
The education sector is today confronted by problems relating to both quantity and quality . 
It may be heartening that the density of educational institutions in India has increased from 10 to 14 institutions per 1 , 000 square kilometres during the Eleventh Plan period . 
But it is disheartening that many places in our country do not have a higher educational institution that are within the practical reach of aspiring students . 
Realising that it is time for us to make innovative changes in the educational sector , we had organised a conference of the Vice Chancellors of the Central Universities in Rashtrapati Bhavan in February of this year . 
During the meeting , we had arrived at some conclusions on the immediate , short - term and medium - term measures that need to be taken to bring in the necessary changes in our education system to address the nation’s requirements . 
The Prime Minster , the Human Resource Development Minister and the Vice Chancellors were agreed on the urgent need to address the challenges that we are facing in the sector . 
I am happy to note that the Ministry of Human Resource Development has started the implementation of the decisions taken in right earnest . 
We hope to show substantial progress by the time we hold the next conference in February 2014 . 
India has the second largest higher education system in the world , but the gross enrolment in the country in 2010 was only about 19 per cent , which is much below the world average of 29 per cent . 
Adding to the woes is the low enrolment rate of the disadvantaged sections which is much below the national average . 
To make education accessible to more students , our efforts must be directed at bringing higher education closer to our population to particularly those in remote corners of the country . 
We must remove the imbalances in the reach of higher education across states , regions and sections of society . 
Open and Distance Learning can aid in enhancing the reach of higher education . 
The enrolment in such programmes in our country increased from 27 lakh to 42 lakh during the Eleventh Plan period . 
The time is now ripe to deploy innovative technologies for greater coverage and for improvising modules that can enable better learning . 
Inclusivity in higher education should be based on affordability as well . 
Various student aid programmes such as scholarships , education loans and self - help schemes should be appropriately structured into the academic system . 
Affiliated colleges are the core of our higher education system as they enrol about 87 per cent of all students . 
But affiliation alone would not suffice . 
The affiliating universities must be particularly careful in guiding these colleges to ensure high standards in the curricula and evaluation systems . 
Particularly , the Central Universities which are seen as the centres of excellence , should promote high standards and act as centres of inspiration to other institutes of learning . 
If we are to redefine the way education is imparted by our educational institutions , the time is now . 
According to an international ranking of universities , no Indian university finds a place amongst the global top 200 universities . 
This you would agree , is simply unacceptable . 
We must develop our universities into global leaders , and for that , the best practices in other countries should be carefully studied and adopted with necessary changes to suit our conditions . 
Shortage of faculty and low standards of instruction are at the core of our concerns . 
In Central Universities , close to 51 per cent of posts of professor are lying vacant . 
While we take urgent steps to fill the vacancies , new ways of employing technology - based learning and collaborative information and communication sharing should be evolved . 
Lectures by eminent professors could be transmitted to educational institutions situated away from the main towns and cities using the facilities offered by the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology ( NMEICT ) . 
Refresher courses for teachers conducted by the Academic Staff Colleges can also be similarly transmitted . 
Every university should identify a group of 10 to 20 ‘inspired teachers’ who can ignite the minds of the students to learn beyond the text books . 
If such teachers interact with each other as well as with the students , the quality of teaching could be enhanced . 
Their lectures could also be relayed to remote educational institutions through NMEICT Networks . 
Innovation holds the key to future progress . 
India’s record in innovation is not very encouraging . 
The number of patent applications filed in India in 2011 was around 42 , 000 . 
This is far below the 5 lakh plus applications that China and the US each filed in 2011 . 
With 17 percent of the world population India’s share in the number of patent applications filed world - wide is only about 2 per cent . 
The thrust on research and innovation in our higher educational institutions is lacking . 
Out of the 260 lakh students who were enrolled at the under - graduate level and above in 2011 - 12 , only one lakh or 0 . 4 per cent had registered for PhD . 
Therefore , innovation has to be aggressively promoted by our institutes of higher learning , apart from research and development centres . 
We must set up industry incubation parks , increase the number of research fellowships , promote inter - disciplinary research through inter - university and intra - university collaboration , and adequately empower our centres of excellence . 
Our academic and research positions in important institutions of higher learning suffer from talent deficiency . 
Our systems are not conducive to retaining talents , and hence , lose many of them to organizations within and outside the country . 
By an adequate system of incentivization , we should be able to discourage this outflow of intellectual capital and at the same time encourage scholars of Indian origin working abroad to return to the country for determined periods of time . 
Such a policy could yield higher results in the form of transmission of ideas and new methods of teaching and research . 
There are many grass - root - level innovators in our country whose ideas could be developed into marketable products through technological and commercial support . 
These innovators need mentoring and our universities , as the fountain head of knowledge , should take the lead . 
I am happy to note that the University of Delhi has established an inter - disciplinary platform called ‘Cluster Innovation Centre’ . 
I hope the students undertaking hands - on projects find the journey from the grassroots to the classroom worthwhile and are able to focus their education to the needs of the country more effectively . 
The founder of post - Apartheid South Africa , Nelson Mandela , had once observed : 
" Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” . 
I am delighted to learn about the initiative of the University of Delhi to use the challenges faced by our country as a core theme in creating new syllabi . 
It would also be necessary to promote a culture of excellence in our universities . 
A beginning in this direction could be made by identifying at least one centre in each of the universities . 
The Ministry of Human Resource Development , the University Grants Commission and each university could join hands for creating such centres within one or two years . 
Topics such as water , environment , health , education and urbanization require in - depth data collection , analysis and research . 
The University’s efforts at providing an academic framework to these issues would significantly contribute to the understanding of our policy makers and the formulation of effective schemes . 
Experience from around the world has shown that the alumni interest and involvement in the development of their alma mater has shown great results . 
I am confident that this University’s alumni would be encouraged to actively participate in this effort . 
I wish all the students the very best in their lives and careers and strongly urge you to follow the advice of Mahatma Gandhi who said : 
Live as if you were to die tomorrow . 
Learn as if you were to live forever . 
I also wish the management and faculty of this University every success in their future endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the banquet in honour of The President of The Arab Republic of Egypt , H . E . Dr . Mohamed Morsy
It gives me great pleasure to extend a warm welcome to you , Excellency , and the distinguished members of your delegation on your first State Visit to India . 
Your presence here today , as the democratically elected President of Egypt is particularly significant . 
It has been now more than 2 years since the historic events at Tahrir Square . 
We , in India , watched with admiration and respect as the young crowds in Cairo chanted Selmiyya Selmiyya ( peacefully , peacefully ) and echoed the words of the Father of our Nation , Mahatma Gandhi . 
Gandhi himself , during India ' s long freedom struggle , had drawn upon the Egyptian experience in fighting colonialism , and held in high esteem leaders such as Saad Zaghloul . 
While returning from a Conference in London in 1931 , he was prevented from disembarking at Port Said by colonial authorities . 
He instead issued a message to the Egyptian people wishing them all success in their struggle . 
As your Excellency is well aware , our historical ties go back much further . 
Even prior to the Common Era , Emperor Ashoka ' s edicts record contact with Egypt under Ptolemy II . 
Traders , artisans and philosophers have crossed the seas time and again to enrich each other ' s composite cultures . 
It is really no surprise , that commercial and cultural interactions continue to be at the forefront of our relations . 
I am happy to note that bilateral trade has increased steadily in the last 5 years , crossing $ 5 billion , despite the global economic slowdown , Indian companies across diverse sectors continue to invest in Egypt
During your visit a number of agreements have been signed , indicating our extensive cooperation in a variety of fields . 
Excellency , the future will be determined by the youth of our nations . 
India and Egypt may be ancient cultures , but our people are young , and their aspirations , hopes and grievances will determine our progress . 
As we strive to provide greater economic opportunities , and channelize the energies of our youth towards nation building , we recognize that it cannot be business as usual . 
We must find new ways of engagement within our societies and between our countries . 
Democracy is incomplete without equity . 
The yearning for ' bread , social justice and equality ' is universal . 
At the international level , Egypt and India have worked together closely , recognizing that in our inter - connected world , threats and opportunities , whether it be climate change , terrorism or trade are truly transnational issues . 
We are confident of your support and participation in revitalizing South - South cooperation , particularly in the Non - Aligned Movement and in the Group of 77 . 
We seek your active cooperation in building a genuinely representative global order . 
In the year 1926 , the Indian poet and humanist Rabindranath Tagore arrived in Cairo to deliver a lecture . 
He was hosted at the house of the most celebrated of Arab poets , Ahmed Shawki , where to his surprise , many of the political leaders turned up to greet him , postponing the Parliament session by an hour . 
Tagore would write of the event in his diary " This was a novel way to show me their respect , a homage paid to knowledge by politics . 
This was possible only in the East . 
Tagore was referring to Egypt as a symbol of the East , where under the glory and might of the Arab and Islamic civilization , knowledge and scholarship were celebrated , and freedom of thought and individual rights were respected . 
Excellency , we are confident that these same values inspire your thought and your action in Egypt , as well as in the larger politics of West Asia , where your sage counsel is so critically needed . 
We stand with you in our unequivocal support for the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people , and look forward to working closely with you in realizing that goal . 
Excellency , two years ago , the people of Egypt chose to walk the long and difficult path of democracy . 
I use the metaphor of the road deliberately , since we in India know today , 65 years after independence , that democracy is neither a destination nor an absolute principle . 
It is more in the nature of a journey , with the steady creation of independent institutions and the careful accretion of compromises , all the while remaining faithful to the essential values of human dignity and freedom . 
And as much as any journey is made more fulfilling by the presence of companions , we in India stand ready to walk with your great nation . 
I am confident that your visit will be the beginning of a new era of enhanced cooperation and closer ties between our two great nations . 
Please also accept , Excellency , our best wishes for your personal well - being and the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of the Arab Republic of Egyp
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the conference on " The Future of Indian Universities : Comparative Perspectives on Higher Education Reforms for a Knowledge Society " at O . P . Jindal Global University
It is indeed a privilege for me to be present on the inauguration of the conference on " The Future of Indian Universities : Comparative Perspectives on Higher Education Reforms for a Knowledge Society” being hosted by O . P . Jindal Global University . 
I am thankful to O . P . Jindal Global University for organising this conference . 
This Conference , I believe , could not have been organised at a more appropriate time . 
The need to make critical reforms in our educational system is more compelling now , in many ways , than at any time before . 
There is an urgent need to raise the quality of teaching , faculty and research in our universities . 
There could be no second opinion on the critical role that education plays in the development of a nation . 
It is the most powerful tool that can spawn societal changes and transform the economic fortunes of a country . 
In the words of Benjamin Franklin , " an investment in knowledge pays the best interest” . 
I compliment O . P . Jindal Global University for choosing a subject of such topical relevance and importance for the country for this conference that is being held today . 
I take this opportunity also of paying homage to Late Shri O . P . Jindal , a leading industrialist of this country in whose fond memory this university is established . 
There are several important reasons why we need to focus our attention on the educational sector . 
I hardly need to emphasize that we have a young population and the demographic profile of our country can be a boon . 
It would be a boon if we are able to harness their potential . 
But our failure to do so and channelize their productive energies may visit us with terrible negative consequences . 
These challenges can be daunting . By the year 2020 , the average age of an India will be 29 years , which will be much lower than average age of 40 years in the US , 46 years in Japan and 47 years in Europe . Over two - third Indians will be of working age by 2025 . 
These statistics make it imperative for us to focus on the educational needs of our young population . 
We must recognize that the demographic dividend can only be reaped if the young population is provided higher education and training in vocational skills . 
At the end of the Eleventh Five Year Plan period , India had 659 degree awarding institutions and 33 , 023 colleges
hese numbers are indeed impressive but many more would have to be established . 
They are required to meet the growing demands for higher education , especially in the rural areas in the country . 
There are several areas in the country far removed from any college or university
This has led to the low rate of enrolment in higher education . 
Only around 7 per cent of those aged between 18 - 24 years join higher education in India , while it is 21 per cent in Germany and 34 per cent in the US . 
Increased access would not only help expand the base of the educational pyramid , but also promote inclusiveness . 
It can also be promoted by making education affordable to the marginalized sections of the society . 
Student aid programmes like scholarships , education loans and self - help schemes should therefore be liberalized for deserving students . 
We lack universities that can provide quality education that meet global benchmarks . 
It is a matter of concern that there is not a single Indian university in the top 200 universities in the world as per an international survey of universities . 
This position is not at all acceptable . This calls for serious introspection . 
With educational standards that fall short of international benchmarks , India would be grievously handicapped in this competitive world . 
The National Knowledge Commission in its Report in 2006 described the falling standards of higher education in the country as a ‘quiet crisis that runs deep’ . 
We cannot wait any longer before we take remedial action . 
We do not have the luxury of time . 
We must promote a culture of excellence in our educational system . 
I can suggest a concrete step in this direction which would be to identify one department in every university and transform into a Centre of Excellence . 
To achieve this , the Ministry of Human Resource Development , the University Grants Commission and the Universities would have to work together in close collabration . 
Amongst the academic challenges that we face , is the large number of vacancies in the Universities . 
In Central Universities alone , the vacancy of teachers is around an unacceptable level of 38 per cent . 
This has to change . We cannot expect to impart quality education without qualified teachers who are most equipped to provide guidance to students and encourage research . 
There are several steps that we may need to take to achieve qualitative improvement in our educational system , to make it as good as the best in the world . 
For this , the Ministry of Human Resource Development , the University Grants Commission and Universities and all stakeholders should work out a common approach . 
The focus should be on quality , affordability and accessibility , the three cornerstones of higher education . 
The private sector should be encouraged to play a larger role in our educational system . 
Some of the top universities of the world have been built on the initiative of the private sector . 
In India , the private sector has left its mark in several key sectors like health , transport and financial services . 
I see no reason why the Indian private sector cannot replicate its efforts in the higher education sector as well . 
But , care should be taken to ensure that there is no dilution in educational standards . Here again I take this opportunity of congratulating the O . P . Jindal Global University to take the lead . 
Affiliated colleges enroll about 87 per cent of all students and are at the core of our higher education system . 
The affiliating universities should , however , exercise due diligence to ensure that adequate curricula and evaluation systems are adopted by such colleges . 
We should also be able to harness the power of technology to promote education . 
Classroom teaching in one university could be transmitted for the benefit of a wider student population in other universities using modern technology . 
For instance , lectures of eminent professors could be transmitted to educational institutions situated away from the main towns and cities using the facilities offered by the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology . 
National Knowledge Network , which aims at the connection of knowledge generating institutions through high speed broad band network has made substantial progress . 
We have been able to link 955 out of the 1 , 500 institutions to this Network . 
. The balance one - third institutions should be connected on priority basis to bring its benefits to remote areas . 
Our universities would also benefit immensely by fully utilizing the services of ‘inspired teachers’ . 
About 10 to 20 such teachers who can spark the student minds to seek knowledge beyond the text book could be identified . 
When such teachers interact with their peers and with students , it will result in the qualitative improvement in the capacity to impart and absorb knowledge . 
The progress of nations will be determined in large measure by their capacity to innovate . 
India’s performance indicators in this segment are discouraging in comparison to her major competitors . 
Though Indians represent about 17 per cent of the global population , only 2 per cent of the patent applications in the world in 2011 were filed in India . 
In the same year , the number of patent applications filed in India was around 42 , 000 . 
In comparison , 5 lakh plus patent applications were each filed in China and the US . 
Universities and Research Centres should become fertile grounds for innovation . 
Setting up industry incubation parks , enhancing the coverage of research students by fellowships , promoting inter - disciplinary research through inter - university and intra - university collaboration , and empowering our centres of excellence would be important steps in this direction . 
We should erect innovative structures to encourage and retain intellectual resources in our academic and research centres . 
Indian scholars working overseas in important research and teaching positions should also be encouraged to take up short - term assignments in Indian Universities . 
This would facilitate dissemination of knowledge and cross - fertilization of ideas . 
In our country , there are many innovations that take place at the grass - root levels . 
But for the nation to derive benefit from them , we need to make them commercially marketable . 
Our universities should be equipped to encourage grass - root innovators and play the role of a mentor . 
With a view to evolving a time - bound action plan and make innovative changes in the higher education sector , a conference of the Vice Chancellors of the Central Universities was organized in the Rashtrapati Bhavan in February of this year . 
The Conference identified certain immediate , short - term and medium - term measures that would need to be taken to reform the education system . 
The changes are being worked upon by the Ministry of Human Resource Development . 
I hope to see substantial progress in the implementation of the measures by the time we hold the next conference in February 2014 . 
I had stated in my Address to the Nation on the eve of the last Republic Day that it is high time for us , for the nation as a whole , to reset its moral compass . 
Our universities and other institutes of higher learning should aid in this process . 
A beginning may be made by introducing value education that would supplement the academic curricula , thereby preparing students to face the test of career and life with equanimity . 
I once again congratulate the O . P . Jindal Global University for taking the initiative and providing a platform to facilitate a greater understanding of the challenges of the higher education sector by all stakeholders . 
I am confident that this Conference would throw up new ideas and thoughts . 
I wish the organizers every success in the conduct of this Conference . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the meeting with The Recipients of Inspire Awards
First of all my greetings to all the young and budding scientists and INSPIRE Awardees who have come here from various parts of the country . 
Dear young students , I see the future of India in you , it is for sure that the shape of India to come would be determined by youth of the nation . 
Science and Technology and Innovation will form the new grammar of development . 
My dear children , what has differentiated the post - industrial world from the previous centuries is Science and Technology . 
The way we live on earth has been significantly transformed by Science and Technology . 
In Twenty - first century , those nations which use Science and Technology are likely to emerge as global powers . 
Knowledge is also likely to emerge as the next driver of change in the world . 
Many of you will be driver of change , which will happen in India and the World . 
India with a strong scientific and technical manpower has an opportunity to become a major knowledge power in the years to come . 
To make this dream a reality , we have to invest in research and development . 
Best investment that a Nation could make is in her youth power . 
To capitalize the advantages of large demographic dividend and huge scientific talent pool , we have announced the Science , Technology and Innovation Policy 2013 . 
The INSPIRE scheme will act as a catalyst in implementation of the newly announced policy . 
My dear children , you are the future of India . 
Therefore , nation has chosen to invest into you . Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research ( INSPIRE ) is one of the significant investments of India into the youth of the nation
I congratulate the Ministry for taking the initiative . 
I am told that all of you who have assembled here today are selected from a group of over 5 . 2 lakh children who received INSPIRE Awards . 
I am particularly happy to note that about 48 % of the INSPIRE awardees are girls out of the total 8 lakh awards sanctioned since inception . 
I am informed that , you all have participated in the National Level Project Exhibition Competition and selected for State , Regional and National level prizes . 
You all have crossed many levels to reach at this stage . 
I congratulate each one of you individually and also as a group of young people , who are likely to write a new destiny for this nation . 
I have been told that some of your project entries are so amazing that the Department is processing a few of them for patenting . You have demonstrated interesting potentials . 
Some of you could become scientists , engineers , doctors and professional researchers . 
You could discover new facets of science , the way C . V . Raman , J . C . Bose , S . N . Bose and Srinivasa Ramanujan did . 
Discovery processes in Science would remain one of the most celebrated activities of human kind . 
India is a developing country and we need solutions to some of the most challenging problems of the society . 
We need to find new technologies for meeting our food , energy , water and healthcare requirements . 
India would need a new brand of solutions designers and this is where you all can contribute . 
Let us take the example of Edison . 
He invented a new way to make electrical bulb which would give light . 
His invention has changed the lives of people all over the world and today we cannot think of life without electricity . 
We can list innumerable number of inventions which have transformed , the way we work and live in the modern society . 
INSPIRE aims to help the youth of this country to become scientists and researchers . 
India has started to invest significantly into Research and Development as well as education sectors . 
Several new academic and research institutions have been established during the last ten years . 
There will be new opportunities for talented youth to become researchers . 
Our industrial and agriculture sectors also have started to invest more into research and development . 
World over , Indian talent pool is respected . Several Multi National Companies have established their global R & D centers in India . 
In a way , R & D capability of India is just opening up for planned investments . 
These developments open up new opportunities and challenges to those who can dream , and sky is the limit for achievement . 
Sir C . V . Raman won the Nobel Prize in Science for his work done in India . 
There have been people like S . Chandrasekhar , Har Gobind Khorana and more recently Venki Ramakrishnan , who have won Nobel Prizes for their work done abroad . 
India is a country of billion plus minds with billion plus innovative ideas . 
If we can ignite these minds and convert few of them in reality , it will bring glory to individuals as well as to the nation as a whole . 
I am sure that the young scientists present here will transform India into a league of nations , which proudly owns patents of new discoveries and products and in the process , making India emerge as a knowledge economy with its own solutions to its necessities . 
Scientific creativity blooms early in life . 
I am happy to note that you all have started on your creative projects at the right age . 
You will be happy to know that our own C . V . Raman wrote his first paper when he was 18 , Ramanujan started his own research by the time he was 17 and Astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar ' s Nobel Prize winning work was done when he was 19 or 20 years old . 
The list is long , but the trend is very clear . You all have shown the potential of a scientist . 
It is the responsibility of the society and all of us to ensure that we as a nation capitalize on your scientific capabilities . 
I am happy that the Ministry of Science and Technology , in collaboration with the schools spread all over the country , is engaged in this task which will be further streamlined with the e - management of INSPIRE Awards scheme . 
This is only one way of engaging the creative minds of the society . 
We have to find many more ways to ensure that no creative idea in this country is left without being nurtured . 
This will ensure that we as a country are self reliant for our scientific and technological requirements and in the process we emerge as exporter of knowledge based products . 
In the recently concluded Conference of Vice Chancellors of Central Universities at Rashtrapati Bhavan , I have asked for setting up the National Innovation Clubs and linking up the grassroots innovators to the Central Universities . 
This is for converting grassroots innovations into value added technologies . 
During my visits to these Central Universities I will have the opportunity of meeting the regional innovators to see that the linkages between the innovators and the Central Universities are well established for the benefit of the society and the nation as a whole . 
Once again I would like to congratulate the INSPIRE awardees for their talent , hard work and devotion towards science . 
I am sure with your dedication and hard work , you can achieve what you aspire to have . 
I would also like to compliment the Ministry of Science and Technology and all associated schools in helping the young scientists to realize their potential . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of The Presentation of National Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises Awards
It is indeed a pleasant occasion for me to be here today for the presentation of the National Awards for Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSMEs ) , which is an important event in the calendar of business awards in India . 
These Awards , instituted 30 years back , denote excellence in entrepreneurship by recognizing outstanding performers in the MSME sector , including khadi and village industries , as well as banks that have encouraged its development . 
I applaud the efforts of the Ministry of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises for having provided fillip to greater entrepreneurial effort , culture of innovation , and continuous improvement in product quality in this important industrial sector . 
I congratulate all the winners of this year’s National MSME Awards , who have set benchmarks of excellence for other entrepreneurs . 
The micro , small and medium enterprises is perhaps the most crucial link between India’s economic growth and socio - economic transformation . 
This sector contributes about 8 per cent of the country’s GDP , 45 per cent of the manufactured output and 40 per cent of the total exports . 
his is a key driver of our country’s industrial growth as it comprises about 36 million enterprises that generate over 6 , 000 products and employ over 80 million persons . 
The MSME sector is characterized by its heterogeneity . 
It is diverse in terms of size , technology level , location , and product range that spans from grass - root village industries to sophisticated units producing auto components , micro - processors , electronic components and electro - medical devices . 
As MSME units have a high degree of geographic dispersion , their development assumes great significance for an equitable and inclusive growth which is the ultimate objective of our economy . 
The challenges to the MSME sector in India are many . 
This sector has great potential to be a true agent of socio - economic change . 
But for that , we must direct our efforts at increasing the competitiveness of this sector by enhancing the availability of institutional credit , promoting innovation and technology , providing adequate industrial infrastructure , meeting the demands for skill development and capacity building , and strengthening market support . 
To extend an enabling infrastructure for MSME units , reliance on industrial clusters has been found prudent in many countries . 
By providing shared access to amenities like testing centres , utilities , roads , security , effluent treatment , training of workers , and marketing , clusters can provide substantial benefits in terms of technology absorption , efficiency enhancement and growth for these units . 
I am told that the Cluster Development Programme of the Government has been active in building capacity , upgrading infrastructure and setting up common facility centres . 
I am confident of this scheme fulfilling its objective of bringing sustainable growth to this sector . 
The National Manufacturing Policy , 2011 has envisaged the setting up of dedicated National Investment and Manufacturing Zones to bring together modern infrastructure , technology , skill development centres , and state - of - the - art connectivity to become the nuclei of manufacturing growth . 
I expect the manufacturing MSME units to take full advantage of this initiative . 
The growth potential of the MSME units should not be impeded by lack of access to financial resources . 
There is a need to increase the reach and coverage of financial institutions by expanding branch network to locations near industrial clusters . 
Our Capital Market is an important resource - raising medium for our business . 
The Small and Medium Enterprises Exchange platform launched by the National Stock Exchange and the BSE would allow small and medium enterprises to access the capital market to raise necessary resources . 
This will also help diversify risk in these enterprises by widening the investor base . 
The potential of knowledge - based industries in India is very high . 
To facilitate their growth , increased access to alternative sources of capital like private equity , venture capital and angel funds should be made possible . 
It is gratifying to note that our efforts at easing the flow of credit to the MSME sector have continued unabated . 
The Union Budget 2013 - 14 has envisaged doubling the refinance capacity of the Small Industries Development Bank of India to Rs . 10 , 000 crore per year , and setting up a Rs . 500 crore corpus with the Bank to facilitate up - scaling of factoring services . 
I am also happy to note that the India Microfinance Equity Fund , which was set up in 2011 - 12 with a budgetary support of Rs . 100 crore to assist micro finance institutions by provision of equity , is being allocated an additional amount of Rs . 100 crore . 
Our future progress will be determined largely by the level of technology that will drive our economy . 
Innovation and technology provides the competitive edge that our industrial sector at large and the MSME sector in particular should not be deprived of . 
We must aim at developing relevant technologies to re - engineer manufacturing processes , reduce costs , improve turnaround time and enhance product quality . 
For that , the industry and academic and research institutions should collaborate to identify and find solutions to existing technology gaps . 
Tool Rooms and Technology Development Centres have been found useful in providing technology and design support to MSME units . 
There is a need to replicate such efforts . I am therefore pleased to note that 15 such centres are being set up during the Twelfth Plan period at a cost of Rs . 2 , 200 crore . 
This decade is the decade of innovation . Our drive towards innovation must benefit the bottom of the socio - economic pyramid . 
There are many cutting edge innovations that , due to lack of technological and commercial support , remain denied of development into marketable products . 
Institutional mentoring of grass root innovators would go a long way in taking the benefits of technology closer to the people . 
I am hopeful that the ‘India Inclusive Innovation Fund’ being envisaged would create a new class of entrepreneurs by building an economic model around the needs and problems of the poor . 
The demographic profile of our nation is likely to change in the times to come . 
By 2025 , two - third Indians will be in the working age bracket . This is both a challenge and an opportunity . 
We have to gainfully employ our working population to ensure that their contribution to national progress is unearthed to the fullest extent . 
To stimulate employment creation , healthy industrial relations and capacity building mechanisms are a must . 
Our strategies must focus on up - gradation of our technical institutes , both in terms of quality and quantity , setting up of more technical institutes to cater to the increasing demand , and skill development of our manpower to equip them with the relevant expertise and knowhow . 
The legal entitlements for our country’s workforce must be aimed at greater employment generation . 
Our labour laws should be able to address the contemporary business models and reflect the pragmatic rights and obligations of the employer and the employee . 
Our MSME units can prosper only if there is a concerted effort at widening the market for their products . 
On account of the scale of operation , most of these units are not capable of individual initiative in marketing , brand building and promotion . 
The Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises 2012 , which mandates Central Government Ministries and Public Sector Undertakings to procure at least 20 per cent of their annual purchases from the micro and small enterprises , would address the marketing concerns of this sector to a great extent . 
But more importantly , market development assistance - trade fairs , packaging technology , bar coding and standardization - should be strengthened through the joint efforts of the Government and industry associations . 
Close to 95 per cent of the MSME units are micro enterprises that employ around 69 per cent of the total MSME workforce . 
Most of the micro enterprises operate in the unorganized sector and require substantive support for their growth . 
The categorization of MSME units on the single criteria of investment in plant and machinery or equipment – ceiling of Rs . 10 crore , Rs . 5 crore and Rs . 25 lakh for medium , small and micro enterprises respectively in manufacturing sector and Rs . 5 crore , Rs . 2 crore and Rs . 10 lakh for these classes of units in services sector - is perhaps necessary to channelize the requisite dose of incentives
But we must be watchful that this does not disincentivize firms from growing beyond the threshold . 
Growth of firms is best achieved if allowed to grow unfettered . 
Perhaps , a calibrated approach to the growth of our MSME units may be prudent for the long term . 
The private sector must be active participants in the process of rejuvenating the MSME sector . 
Their partnership in creating a friendly business environment , especially by skill development , product promotion , and technology development , will pave the way for our MSME units to compete successfully with the best in the world . 
I once again take this opportunity of congratulating all the award winners and hope that their success would inspire millions of small entrepreneurs working diligently through the length and breadth of the country . 
I conclude by reminding of the famous observation that Abraham Lincoln once made : " Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any one thing . ”
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at The 14th D . P . Kohli Memorial Lecture organised by The Central Bureau of Investigation
It is indeed a privilege for me to be present amidst you all for the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) . 
I am especially delighted at the opportunity to deliver the 14th Memorial Lecture of Late Dharmanath Prasad Kohli , a visionary who was the founder Director of CBI . 
Late Shri Kohli , an illustrious member of Indian Civil Service , played a definitive role in shaping the character and identity of the organization . 
He instilled the core values of this organization , the three I’s i . e . industry , impartiality and integrity in the organization . 
The stature that CBI has gained over the decades is an eloquent testimony to the distinguished services rendered by him and all the directors who succeeded him and made their own contribution in building up this unique organization . 
The CBI has aptly chosen " Good Governance” as the topic for the 14th D . P . Kohli Memorial Lecture . 
I could not have thought of a more appropriate subject . 
The term , Good Governance , appeared in the development lexicon about two decades back . 
The concept has today gained greater importance and relevance than ever before because of the increasing recognition of its inseparable link to social welfare and public good . 
It has become the key concept in development philosophy . 
Countries too are evaluated on the basis of the quality of governance that they may have succeeded in establishing . 
The concept of Police State long ago was replaced by the concept of Welfare State . 
Lack of good governance has been identified as the root cause of many of the serious deficiencies in society . 
It robs the citizenry of their security , and their social and economic rights . 
Though there is no exhaustive definition of the term good governance , its underlying import and idea is wide . 
It encompasses virtually all aspects of human interaction . 
It is equally relevant at the local and national level as it is at the international level . 
Every organisation within a society has a decisive role in promoting good governance . 
These roles may vary depending on the form of structure and institutions that each society may have evolved . 
Good governance is critically dependent on the existence of some fundamental pre - requisites . 
At the core is the inviolable adherence to rule of law . From it would emanate critical need for participatory decision - making structure , transparency , responsiveness , accountability , equity and inclusiveness . 
In brief , good governance means the existence of an elaborate architecture that has the good of the people as their only focus . Good governance should create a conducive and enabling environment for the people to pursue their happiness . 
As emphasized by Kautiliya in the ancient treatise " Arthashastra” , and I quote : 
The happiness of the people is the happiness of the king ; 
Their good alone is his , his personal good is not his true good ; the only true good being that of his people : 
Therefore let the King be active in working for the prosperity and welfare of his people . 
Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of a strong and prosperous India or full implementation of Purna Swaraj has the essentials of Good Governance forming its base . 
Echoing its universal relevance , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had said : 
" Mahatma by his stress on the underprivileged and poverty stricken forced all of us to think in terms of social justice”
These basic principles of good governance were incorporated in the Constitution by our founding fathers . 
The objective of establishing a welfare state found expression in it . 
Our Constitution outlines the values that should be fundamental in the governance in our country . 
How do we measure up in terms of governance after 66 years of our independence ? 
There is little doubt that we have made great strides in almost all major areas of development . 
From 3 . 5 per cent growth rate per annum during the First Five Year Plan period , we achieved 8 per cent per annum during the Eleventh Five Year Plan period . 
The Green Revolution in the 1960s made our country self - sufficient in food grains . We have also reduced the incidence of poverty . 
Today India is the third largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms . 
We can certainly be proud of these achievements . 
But it is equally true that much more remains to be done . 
The challenges to our governance systems are reflected in some important international analyses which are mainly dependent on the social index . 
India’s ranking in key governance indicators like Voice and Accountability , Political Stability and Absence of Violence , Government Effectiveness , Regulatory Quality , Rule of Law and Control of Corruption are lower than countries such as Brazil , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , UK and US . 
We are at the cross roads of transformation and cannot afford to lose the momentum of change . 
There are several challenges we face and we should face them with determination and conviction . 
And , at the root of them is the issue of governance . 
We have achieved remarkable progress in several of the grids that constitute good governance . 
In some , our achievements have been greater than others . 
There is still immense scope to better our participatory decision making structure , improve the application of rule of law , enhance transparency , increase accountability , promote greater equity and inclusiveness and improve consensus based approach . 
For the sake of brevity , I will elaborate on some of the few grids . 
The incidence of poverty is still around 30 per cent and it is not something that we can live with . 
Statistics of economic progress will count for nothing if we are not able to uplift the marginalised sections of the society . 
Our growth , therefore must have to be inclusive and sustainable . 
Inclusiveness calls for equity in access to basic needs like education and healthcare . 
Our efforts should be directed at making the entire population literate . 
I am confident that the flagship schemes in the education sector , such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan , Mid - Day Meal Scheme and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan would be addressing many of our problems . 
Affordable healthcare should be our priority . 
Many people in this country are forced into poverty due to high costs of medical treatment . 
It is gratifying to note that building on the success of the National Rural Health Mission , a new National Health Mission combining the rural mission and a new urban mission is being envisaged with a budget outlay of over Rs . 21 , 000 crore in 2013 - 14 . 
A healthy population holds the potential to make greater contribution to nation - building . 
Another important aspect in changing our development paradigm is to be noticed today . 
The new terminology is empowerment through entitlement which is backed by legal enactments . 
We have adopted a rights - based approach to our development process . 
The Rights to Education , Employment and Food Security are the core of this development strategy . 
I wish this development strategy should be implemented fully . 
To help empower our marginalized sections , we gave them the right to employment and education . 
We piloted legislations such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act , 2005 and the Right to Education Act , 2009 . 
The process of enacting a law to provide food security to people is also in the process of completion . 
The ‘Aadhaar’ project , would provide every resident with a unique identification number . 
It would help our citizens , especially the poor and needy , to easily access several benefits and services more efficiently . 
The ‘Direct Benefit Transfer’ scheme , launched in January 2013 , too would leverage the Aadhaar system helping the achievement of greater transparency and reduction in transaction costs . 
Our delivery systems need mending and only good governance can provide an answer to the problem . 
If what is meant for the poor does not reach them in the proportion it is meant to , then corruption and inefficiency are its two main causes . 
Corruption is a threat to the democratic fabric of our country . 
It would frustrate the efforts to bring equity to all its citizens . 
I am happy to note that in the recent past , several steps have been taken to reaffirm our commitment to bringing more transparency in governance . 
Some of the steps taken include the ratification of the United Nations Convention against Corruption in 2011 , membership of the Financial Action Task Force since 2010 , introduction of the Prevention of Bribery of Foreign Public Officials and Officials of Public International Organizations Bill 2011 , and initiation of a proposal to make bribery in private sector a criminal offence by bringing an amendment in the Indian Penal Code . 
At the root of poor governance is our lethargy for change , whether it is in the implementation of schemes or adherence to values . 
I do not have to remind you how grievously hurt the nation was when a young woman , the symbol of an aspiring nation , lost her life in the brutal assault in India in December last year . 
As I had said earlier , I repeat and I do believe that it is time to reset our moral compass . 
The police and investigative organisations can play a crucial role in creating conditions that could engender societal changes . 
An alert police force and investigative agency can ensure that no crime goes unpunished . 
It is important to ensure speedy and thorough investigation of allegations . 
The prosecution should also be speedy so that the guilty are punished without delay . 
This would enhance the deterrent value of punishment . 
It would improve responsiveness , one of the most important features of good governance . 
To conclude , let me reiterate that good governance should be our unwavering goal . 
It holds the key to sustainable development , inclusiveness and economic progress . 
Let us , therefore , rededicate ourselves to the achievement of this noble objective . 
I congratulate all the medal winners and their family members who I am confident will continue to serve this nation with devotion , professionalism and foresight . 
I also wish the CBI every success in their future endeavours . 
I congratulate all the past and present officers and staff of CBI whose untiring efforts and single - minded devotion have made it not only the premier investigating agency in the country but perhaps the most sought after agency for investigation by every section of the society . 
That speaks of the credibility of the organization . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the occasion of Ceremonial Reception of INSV Mhadei
It is a proud moment for all us . At the outset , I would like to congratulate the Indian Navy and the skipper of Mhadei on successful completion of Sagar Parikrama - II , the Non - stop Solo Circumnavigation of the Globe . 
To sustain a long voyage of 151 days at sea , solo , non stop unassisted and sailing through some of the most treacherous oceans of the world , is a remarkable feat . 
This rare achievement – the first by an Indian seafarer – showcases the spirit of determination , resolve and courage of both the individual and the organization he represents . 
Solo Circum - navigation , apart from being a physically arduous task also requires very high standards of knowledge of navigation meteorology and boat maintenance . 
The circum - navigator not only gets tossed around by the rough seas but also has to fight solitude and the imponderables of life at Sea , away from civilization , away from fellow humans . 
Battling wave heights of 9 - 10 meters and wind speeds in excess of 100 kmph coupled with Antarctic chills can be an extreme test of human endurance . 
The solitude factor alone is such that being thousands of kms away from the nearest land , there would be very little chance of help or rescue , if something went wrong . 
To undertake crossing of the three Capes , i . e . Cape Leeuwin , Cape Horn and Cape of Good Hope alone require courage , determination and grit of the highest order . 
I am sure that this achievement of Lieutenant Commander Abhilash Tomy will continue to be a source of inspiration for future generations of young seafarers . 
His epic voyage has placed our nation into the ranks of a few select countries whose citizens have been successful and less than 100 individuals in braving such an arduous voyage . 
I would also like to felicitate parents of Lt Cdr Abhilash Tomy and , the mentor of the project VAdm ( Retd ) MP Awati . 
I would also like to congratulate Mr Ratnakar Dandekar who has built this wonderful boat in India . 
I am told that the expedition has generated enormous media attention and created fervour amongst the youth for seafaring and Oceanic adventures . 
I am also given to understand that the internet postings of the Skipper on his blog and Facebook pages have been keenly followed by admirers from all age groups . 
A nation’s social and economic well - being is intricately linked to the seas , not only for trade , but also how it faces threats to its security that develop across the seas . 
Sponsorship of terrorism through non - state actors , and across the seas , is a matter of deep concern to the entire nation . 
Historically , India has always stood for peace . 
Our commitment to peaceful co - existence stems not from weakness but is based on a mature understanding that peace alone can help a nation achieve its objectives of social and economic development . 
Peace can , however , be sought only from a position of strength – strength sufficient to safeguard our territorial sovereignty and maritime interests , both economic and strategic . 
Our resolve to achieve sustained high growth can be realized only if our maritime frontiers and assets are safe , stable and act as enablers . 
The Indian Navy , as the primary element of India’s maritime power , has the challenging task of safeguarding the country’s maritime interests . 
Our country’s security situation predicates that the Navy plays a leadership role . 
It is indeed a matter of great pride that the Indian Navy continues to discharge its responsibilities with professional excellence and élan , whilst simultaneously building bridges of friendship and goodwill across the oceans . 
In this regard , the selfless service , dedication and professionalism of our men and women in white are indeed praiseworthy . 
I extend my good wishes to all uniformed men , women , their families and civilian personnel of the Indian Navy , and wish them continued success in all endeavours . 
Speech by The President of India , Shri Pranab Mukherjee at the inaugural function of The India Water Week
I am delighted to join you for the inauguration of the India Water Week 2013 being organized by the Ministry of Water Resources . 
It is a privilege to be a part of this august gathering comprising renowned public figures , policy makers , experts and professionals . 
The theme for this year , " Efficient Water Management - Challenges and Opportunities” , holds significance in today’s context . 
The severe drought in some parts of our country , particularly Maharashtra , is a matter of grave concern . 
The increasing occurrence of droughts and floods in India has underlined the need to find solutions to improve the management of water resources . 
Our endowment of water resource is disproportionately less than our population . 
India is home to 17 per cent of the world population but possess only 4 per cent of its renewable water resource . 
Due to population expansion , increasing urbanization and the necessity of high economic growth through rapid industrialization , availability of water resource is conspicuous by its competing demands . 
The per capita availability of water has reduced significantly from 1 , 816 cubic meter in 2001 to 1 , 545 cubic meter in 2011 . 
The available water must be managed judiciously to meet the twin burden of population growth and economic development . 
Conservation , balanced distribution and reclamation of used water are essential cogs in the wheel of water management . संरक्षण , 
The influence of climate change on water system is known to all . 
Various studies have indicated the adverse impact of climate change on the hydrologic cycle leading to variations in precipitation . 
This has often resulted in occurrence of flood in some areas and drought in others . 
Climate change also has the potential to affect ground water by reducing its table and quality . 
As part of the National Action Plan on Climate Change , the National Water Mission was launched in 2011 with the objectives of water conservation , minimization of wastage and equitable distribution . 
Our efforts must be directed at mitigating the regional imbalance in water availability . 
. Equitable allocation of water across the country could be made possible by inter - basin water transfer . 
But for that , the environmental and socio - economic impact should be studied before such an initiative is envisaged . 
We must also strive to achieve equity in the allocation of water between urban and rural areas . 
This would negate the potential for any social conflict . Our cities and industrial townships should devise measures for minimal waste of water . 
Losses due to transportation and leakage should be minimized by developing sources of water in close proximity to the point of demand . 
Water conservation should be accorded the high priority that it deserves . 
I am happy to note that the Birth Anniversary of our former Prime Minister , Late Shrimati Indira Gandhi , was also observed as the Water Conservation Day last year . This is a good initiative .

The Bank has prescribed that the valuation of gold jewellery for arriving at the Loan - To - Value ( LTV ) shall be done at the average of the closing price of 22 carat gold for the preceding 30 days as quoted by the Bombay Bullion Association Ltd . ( BBA ) . 
On a review , it has been decided that NBFCs may also use the historical spot gold price data publicly disseminated by a commodity exchange regulated by the Forward Markets Commission .

Lending Against Security of Single Product – Gold Jewellery
Please refer to circular DNBS . CC . PD . No . 356 / 03 . 10 . 01 / 2013 - 14 dated September 16 , 2013 ( ‘the circular’ ) issued in line with the recommendations of the Working Group to Study the Issues Related to Gold Imports and Gold Loan NBFCs in India ( K U B Rao Working Group ) . 
Reference is also drawn to circular DNBS . CC . PD . No . 265 / 03 . 10 . 01 / 2011 - 12 dated March 21 , 2012 wherein NBFCs were required to maintain a Loan - to - Value ( LTV ) Ratio not exceeding 60 percent for loans granted against the collateral of gold jewellery . 
We have received certain representations from NBFCs in the matter . 
These have been examined and it has been decided as under : 
Loan - To - Value ( LTV ) Ratio
In terms of para 2 . 1 of circular DNBS . CC . PD . No . 265 / 03 . 10 . 01 / 2011 - 12 dated March 21 , 2012 , NBFCs were required to maintain LTV ratio not exceeding 60 percent for loans granted against the collateral of gold jewellery . 
It may be recalled that to facilitate monetising of idle gold as far as possible through the organised sector , the KUB Rao Working Group had recommended that the LTV ratio may be increased from 60 percent to 75 percent once the business levels of the gold loan NBFCs come to a level considered appropriate . 
The Working Group had also recommended standardisation of the methodology of determining the value of gold . 
In view of the moderation in the growth of gold loan portfolios of NBFCs in the recent past , and also taking into consideration the experience so far , it has been decided to raise the LTV ratio to upto 75 percent for loans against the collateral of gold jewellery from the present limit of 60 percent with immediate effect . 
In this context , it is understood that some NBFCs are adding making charges etc . to the value of the gold jewellery determined in terms of paragraph 2 ( iii ) of ‘the circular’ . 
It is clarified that the value of the jewellery for the purpose of determining the maximum permissible loan amount will be only the intrinsic value of the gold content therein and no other cost elements should be added thereto . 
The intrinsic value will continue to be arrived at as detailed in ‘the circular’ . 
Standardization of Value of Gold in arriving at LTV Ratio
As per para 2 ( iii ) of ‘the circular’ , NBFCs were required to give in writing to the borrower the purity ( in terms of carats ) and weight of gold . 
NBFCs have raised apprehensions on certifying the purity of the gold jewellery accepted as collateral on grounds that under the current practices it was possible only to arrive at the proximate purity of the gold and that such a certification could lead to dispute with the borrowers . 
It is clarified that the need to give a certificate on the purity of gold cannot be dispensed with . 
The certified purity shall be applied for determining the maximum permissible loan and the reserve price for auction . 
The NBFCs can , however , include suitable caveats to protect themselves against disputes on redemption . 
Verification of the Ownership of Gold
In terms of para 2 . iv of ‘the circular’ , NBFCs were required to keep a record of verification of ownership of the jewellery where the gold jewellery pledged by a borrower at any one time or cumulatively on loan outstanding is more than 20 grams . 
Also the method of establishing ownership should be laid down in the overall loan policy of the NBFC approved by its Board . In view of the fact that it may not be possible for borrowers to produce receipts establishing ownership , especially when the jewellery has been inherited , it is clarified that the ownership verification need not necessarily be through original receipts for the jewellery pledged but a suitable document may be prepared to explain how the ownership was determined , particularly in each and every case where the gold jewellery pledged by a borrower at any one time or cumulatively on loan outstanding is more than 20 grams . 
NBFCs are directed to have an explicit policy in this regard in their overall loan policy . 
Auction Process and Procedures
In terms of para 2 . v of ‘the circular’ , NBFCs were directed to conduct the auction in the same town or taluk in which the branch that had extended the loan is located . 
Representations have been received seeking permission to conduct auction in the district rather than the taluk . 
It has not been found feasible to accept this request and as such the current instructions remain unchanged . 
Other Instructions
In terms of para 2 . vi ( ii ) of ‘the circular’ , NBFCs were directed to disburse high value loans of ` one lakh and above , only through cheque . NBFCs had represented that payment by issue of cheques would lead to delay in the borrower getting access to the funds and the delays could be accentuated where disbursements happen during weekends . 
It is observed that a majority of the loans in the portfolio of NBFCs is below ` one lakh . 
It has therefore been decided to retain the current instructions in this regard . 
Please find enclosed Notifications amending the Non - Banking Financial ( Deposit Accepting or Holding ) Companies Prudential Norms ( Reserve Bank ) Directions , 2007 contained in Notification No . DNBS . 192 / DG ( VL ) - 2007 dated February 22 , 2007 and the Non - Banking Financial ( Non - Deposit Accepting or Holding ) Companies Prudential Norms ( Reserve Bank ) Directions , contained in Notification No .

DNBS . 192 / DG ( VL ) - 2007 dated February 22 , 2007 , in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 45JA of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 ( 2 of 1934 ) and of all the powers enabling it in this behalf , hereby directs that the said Directions shall be amended with immediate effect as follows , namely - 
Sub clause ( i ) of clause ( a ) of Paragraph 17A shall be replaced with the following - 
“ ( i ) maintain a Loan - to - Value ( LTV ) Ratio not exceeding 75 per cent for loans granted against the collateral of gold jewellery” ; 
Provided that the value of gold jewellery for the purpose of determining the maximum permissible loan amount shall be the intrinsic value of the gold content therein and no other cost elements shall be added thereto . 
The intrinsic value of the gold jewellery shall be arrived at as detailed in paragraph 17C ( 1 ) of the Directions . ’’
The last sentence in Paragraph ( 17B ) shall be replaced with the following - 
“The ownership verification need not necessarily be through original receipts for the jewellery pledged but a suitable document may be prepared to explain how the ownership was determined , particularly in each and every case where the gold jewellery pledged by a borrower at any one time or cumulatively on loan outstanding is more than 20 grams . 
NBFCs shall have an explicit policy in this regard as approved by the Board in their overall loan policy . ”
The following shall be inserted in the clause ( iii ) of sub - para ( 1 ) of Paragraph 17 C , after the last sentence
“NBFCs may have suitable caveats to protect themselves against disputes during redemption , but the certified purity shall be applied both for determining the maximum permissible loan and the reserve price for auction . ”

Master Circular on SHG - Bank Linkage Programme
The Reserve Bank of India has , from time to time , issued a number of guidelines / instructions to banks on SHG - Bank Linkage Programme . 
In order to enable the banks to have instructions at one place , a Master Circular incorporating the existing guidelines / instructions on the subject has been updated and enclosed . 
This Master Circular consolidates and updates the circulars issued by Reserve Bank on the subject up to June 30 , 2014 as indicated in the Appendix . 
Despite the vast expansion of the formal credit system in the country , the dependence of the rural poor on moneylenders somehow continued in many areas , especially for meeting emergent requirements . 
Such dependence was pronounced in the case of marginal farmers , landless labourers , petty traders and rural artisans belonging to socially and economically backward classes and tribes whose propensity to save is limited or too small to be mopped up by the banks . 
For various reasons , credit to these sections of the population had not been institutionalized . 
The studies conducted by NABARD , APRACA and ILO on the informal groups promoted by Non - Governmental Organizations ( NGOs ) brought out that Self - Help Savings and Credit Groups had the potential to bring together the formal banking structure and the rural poor for mutual benefit and that their working had been encouraging . 
Accordingly , NABARD launched a pilot project to cover Self - Help Groups ( SHGs ) promoted by Non - Governmental Organizations , banks and other agencies under the pilot project and supported it by way of refinance . 
The quick studies conducted by NABARD in a few states to assess the impact of the linkage project brought out encouraging and positive features like increase in loan volume of the SHGs , definite shift in the loaning pattern of the members from non - income generating activities to production activities , nearly 100 % recovery performance , significant reduction in the transaction costs for both the banks and the borrowers etc , besides leading to gradual increase in the income level of the SHG members . 
Another significant feature observed in the linkage project was that about 85 % of the groups linked with the banks were formed exclusively by women . 
With a view to studying the functioning of SHGs and NGOs for expanding their activities and deepening their role in the rural sector , in November 1994 , RBI constituted a working Group comprising eminent NGO functionaries , academicians , consultants and bankers under the Chairmanship of Shri S . K . Kalia , the then Managing Director , NABARD . 
The Working Group was of the view that the linking of SHGs with the banks is a cost effective , transparent and flexible approach to improve the accessibility of credit from the formal banking system to the unreached rural poor , which is expected to offer the much needed solution to the twin problems being faced by the banks , viz recovery of loans in the rural areas and the high transaction cost in dealing with small borrowers at frequent intervals . 
The Group , therefore , felt that the thrust of the policy should be to encourage the formation of SHGs and their linking with the banks and in this regard , the banks have a major role to play . 
The Working Group had recommended that the banks should treat the linkage programme as a business opportunity and they may design area specific and group specific loan packages taking into account inter alia the potential , local needs , available talent / skills etc . 
The Reserve Bank constituted four informal groups in October 2002 to examine various issues concerning micro - finance delivery . 
Linking of SHGs with banks have been emphasized in the Monetary policy of Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget announcements from time to time and various guidelines have been issued to banks in this regard . 
To scale up the SHGs linkage programme and make it sustainable , banks were advised that they may consider lending to SHGs as part of their mainstream credit operations both at policy and implementation level . 
They may include SHG linkage in their corporate strategy / plan , training curriculum of their officers and staff and implement it as a regular business activity and monitor and review it periodically . 
Separate Segment under priority sector : 
In order to enable the banks to report their SHG lending without difficulty , it was decided that the banks should report their lending to SHGs and / or to NGOs for on - lending to SHGs / members of SHGs under the new segment , viz . ' Advances to SHGs ' irrespective of the purposes for which the members of SHGs have been disbursed loans . 
Lending to SHGs should be included by the banks as part of their lending to the weaker sections . 
Opening of Savings Bank A / c : 
The SHGs registered or unregistered which are engaged in promoting savings habits among their members would be eligible to open savings bank accounts with banks . 
These SHGs need not necessarily have already availed of credit facilities from banks before opening savings bank accounts . 
KYC verification of all the members of SHG need not be done while opening the savings bank account of the SHG as KYC verification of all the office bearers would suffice . 
Further , it is clarified that since KYC would have already been verified while opening the savings bank account and the account continues to be in operation and is being used for credit linkage , no separate KYC verification of the members or office bearers is necessary at the time of credit linking of SHGs , 
SHG lending to be a part of planning process : 
Bank lending to SHGs should be included in branch credit plan , block credit plan , district credit plan and state credit plan of each bank . 
While no target is being prescribed under SHG bank linkage programme , utmost priority should be accorded to the sector in preparation of these plans . 
It should also form an integral part of the bank’s corporate credit plan . 
Margin and Security Norms : 
As per operational guidelines of NABARD , SHGs may be sanctioned savings linked loans by banks ( varying from a saving to loan ratio of 1 : 1 to 1 : 4 ) . 
Experience showed that group dynamics and peer pressure brought in excellent recovery from members of the SHGS . 
The flexibility allowed to the banks in respect of margin , security norms , etc . under the pilot project continues to be operational under the linkage programme even beyond the pilot phase . 
Documentation : A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation is a precondition for augmenting flow of credit to SHGs . 
Keeping in view the nature of lending and status of borrowers , banks should strive to remove all operational irritants and make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and disburse credit by delegating adequate sanctioning powers to branch managers . 
The loan application forms , procedures and documents should be made simple . 
It would help in providing prompt and hassle - free credit . 
Presence of defaulters in SHGs : 
The defaults by a few members of SHGs and / or their family members to the financing bank should not ordinarily come in the way of financing SHGs per se by banks provided the SHG is not in default to it . 
However , the bank loan may not be utilized by the SHG for financing a defaulter member to the bank . 
Capacity Building and Training : 
An important step in the Linkage Programme would be the training of the field level officials and sensitization of the controlling and other senior officials of the bank . 
Considering the need and magnitude of training requirements of bank officers / staff both at field level and controlling office level , the banks may initiate suitable steps to internalize the SHGs linkage project and organize exclusive short duration programmes for the field level functionaries . 
In addition , suitable awareness / sensitization programmes may be conducted for their middle level controlling officers as well as senior officers . 
Monitoring and Review of SHG Lending : 
Having regard to the potential of the SHGs , banks may have to closely monitor the progress regularly at various levels . 
In order to give a boost to the ongoing SHG bank linkage programme for credit flow to the unorganized sector , banks were advised in January 2004 that monitoring of SHG bank linkage programme may be made a regular item on the agenda for discussion at the SLBC and DCC meetings . 
It should be reviewed at the highest corporate level on a quarterly basis . Further the progress of the programme may be reviewed by the banks at regular intervals . 
A progress report may be sent to NABARD ( Micro Credit Innovations Department ) , Mumbai , on a half - yearly basis , as on 30 September and 31 March each year so as to reach within 30 days of the half - year to which the report relates . 
Encourage SHG Linkage : 
Banks should provide adequate incentives to their branches in financing the Self Help Groups ( SHGs ) and establish linkages with them , making the procedures absolutely simple and easy while providing for total flexibility in such procedures to suit local conditions . 
The group dynamics of working of the SHGs may be left to themselves and need neither be regulated nor formal structures imposed or insisted upon . 
The approach to financing of SHGs should be totally hassle - free and may include consumption expenditures . 
Interest rates : The interest rate applicable to loans given by banks to Self Help Groups / member beneficiaries would be left to their discretion . 
Total Financial Inclusion and Credit Requirement of SHGs : 
Banks have been advised to meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members , as envisaged in the Paragraph 93 of the Union Budget announcement made by the Honourable Finance Minister for the year 2008 - 09 where in it was stated as under : 
Banks will be encouraged to embrace the concept of Total Financial Inclusion . 
Government will request all scheduled commercial banks to follow the example set by some public sector banks and meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members , namely , ( a ) income generation activities , ( b ) social needs like housing , education , marriage , etc . and ( c ) debt swapping .

Know Your Customer ( KYC ) norms / Anti - Money Laundering ( AML ) Standards / Combating of Financing of Terrorism ( CFT ) / Obligation of banks under Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) , 2002 - Simplifying norms for Self Help Groups
Please refer to our circular DBOD . AML . BC . No . 65 / 14 . 01 . 001 / 2012 - 13 dated December 10 , 2012 on simplification of Know Your Customer ( KYC ) norms / Anti - Money Laundering ( AML ) Standards / Combating of Financing of Terrorism ( CFT ) / Obligation of banks under PMLA , 2002 . 
In order to address the difficulties faced by Self Help Groups ( SHGs ) in complying with KYC norms while opening savings bank accounts and credit linking of their accounts , it has been decided to simplify certain norms for SHGs . 
Accordingly , KYC verification of all the members of SHG need not be done while opening the savings bank account of the SHG and KYC verification of all the office bearers would suffice . 
As regards KYC verification at the time of credit linking of SHGs , it is clarified that since KYC would have already been verified while opening the savings bank account and the account continues to be in operation and is to be used for credit linkage , no separate KYC verification of the members or office bearers is necessary . 
Banks may revise their KYC policy in the light of the above instructions and ensure strict adherence to the same . 
Please refer to the Master Circular DBOD . AML . BC . No . 11 / 14 . 01 . 001 / 2012 - 13 dated July 02 , 2012 on Know Your Customer ( KYC ) norms / Anti - Money Laundering ( AML ) Standards / Combating of Financing of Terrorism ( CFT ) / Obligation of banks under PMLA , 2002 . 
The KYC guidelines were formulated to protect the financial system against threat of money laundering / terror financing and frauds . 
However , it has been brought to the notice of Reserve Bank that some of the provisions made in this regard or their implementation by banks have led to avoidable inconvenience to public and also hindered the efforts at financial inclusion . 
In this connection , we invite your attention to para 101 ( extract enclosed ) of the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2012 - 13 announced on October 30 , 2012 , proposing to review the existing KYC norms for simplifying them within the provisions of PML Act / Rules and international standards . 
Accordingly , it has been decided to effect the following modifications in the existing provisions : 
Opening of new accounts – Proof of identity and address - 
An indicative list of the nature and type of documents / information that may be relied upon for customer identification is given in Annex I of the aforesaid Master Circular . Paras 2 . 4 ( h ) and 2 . 4 ( i ) of the Master Circular clearly state that the said list is only indicative and not exhaustive . 
For accounts of individuals , separate sets of indicative documents have been listed for identity and for address verification in Annex I . 
Consequently , banks have been calling for separate documents for verification of identity and address even though the documents for identity proof ( Passport , Drivers’ Licence etc . ) also carry the address of the individual concerned . 
In view of this , customers frequently complain about the requirement of producing two sets of documents , one each for identity and address proof . 
To ease the burden on the prospective customers in complying with KYC requirements for opening new accounts , it has now been decided that : 
If the address on the document submitted for identity proof by the prospective customer is same as that declared by him / her in the account opening form , the document may be accepted as a valid proof of both identity and address . 
If the address indicated on the document submitted for identity proof differs from the current address mentioned in the account opening form , a separate proof of address should be obtained . 
For this purpose , apart from the indicative documents listed in Annex I of the Master Circular , a rent agreement indicating the address of the customer duly registered with State Government or similar registration authority may also be accepted as a proof of address . 
Introduction not Mandatory for opening accounts - 
Before implementation of the system of document - based verification of identity , as laid down in PML Act / Rules , introduction from an existing customer of the bank was considered necessary for opening of bank accounts . 
In many banks , obtaining of introduction for opening of accounts is still a mandatory part of customer acceptance policy even though documents of identity and address as required under our instructions are provided . 
This poses difficulties for prospective customers in opening accounts as they find it difficult to obtain introduction from an existing account holder . 
Since introduction is not necessary for opening of accounts under PML Act and Rules or Reserve Bank’s extant KYC instructions , banks should not insist on introduction for opening bank accounts of customers . 
Acceptance of Aadhaar letter for KYC purposes - 
Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) has advised Reserve Bank that banks are accepting Aadhaar letter issued by it as a proof of identity but not of address , for opening accounts . 
As indicated at para 2 ( i ) above , if the address provided by the account holder is the same as that on Aadhaar letter , it may be accepted as a proof of both identity and address . 
Acceptance of NREGA Job Card as KYC for normal accounts - In terms of para 2 . 7 ( B ) ( b ) of the Master Circular , accounts opened only on the basis of NREGA Job Card are subject to limitation applicable to ‘Small Accounts’ as prescribed in our circular DBOD . AML . No . 77 / 14 . 01 . 001 / 2010 - 11 dated January 27 , 2011 . 
This has caused inconvenience to customers , who are mostly from rural areas . 
In modification of instructions quoted above , banks are advised that they may now accept NREGA Job Card as an ‘officially valid document’ for opening of bank accounts without the limitations applicable to ‘Small Accounts’ . 
Accounts with Introduction –
The provisions for opening of bank accounts with restrictions on total credits and outstanding balance , with introduction from an existing account holder or other evidence of identity and address to the satisfaction of the bank , were made to help persons who were not able to provide ‘officially valid documents’ for opening accounts . 
In view of provisions for ' Small Accounts ' being included in the PML Rules , the extant instructions for opening of ' Accounts with Introduction ' as prescribed in our circular DBOD . No . AML . BC . 28 / 14 . 01 . 001 / 2005 - 06 dated August 23 , 2005 and in paragraph 2 . 6 of the Master Circular stand withdrawn . 
It has been brought to our notice that banks are not promoting opening of ‘Small Accounts’ for greater financial inclusion . 
Banks are , therefore , advised to open ‘Small Accounts’ for all persons who so desire . 
It is reiterated that all limitations applicable to ‘Small Accounts’ should be strictly observed . 
Banks should review their KYC policy in the light of the above instructions and ensure strict adherence to the same .

Calendar of Reviews
Please refer to our circular No . DBOD . BP . BC . 71 / 21 . 03 . 038 / 2007 - 08 dated April 22 , 2008 advising banks regarding Calendar of Reviews to be put up to the Board / Management Committee . 
RBI has prescribed comprehensive ‘Calendar of Reviews’ to be deliberated by the Boards of banks and has made significant additions to the same over the years . 
It has been observed that Calendar of Reviews uses considerable Board time and as a result the Board may not be in a position to give focused attention to matters of strategic and financial importance . 
In this connection , the Committee to Review Governance of Boards of Banks in India ( Chairman - Dr . P J Nayak ) had also recommended that discussions in the Boards of banks need to be upgraded and greater focus should be on strategic issues . 
Accordingly , in the first bi - monthly monetary policy statement 2015 - 16 , it was proposed to do away with the Calendar of Reviews and instead , replace it with the seven critical themes prescribed by the Nayak Committee namely , business strategy , financial reports and their integrity , risk , compliance , customer protection , financial inclusion and human resources ( as illustrated in Annex ) , and leave it to the banks’ Boards to determine other list of items to be deliberated and periodicity thereof . 
Banks are advised to determine the Board agenda items and the periodicity thereof , with the approval of their Boards , such that there is adequate focus on matters of strategic and financial importance , including the seven broad themes indicated above . 
This supersedes our circular No . DBOD . BP . BC . 71 / 21 . 03 . 038 / 2007 - 08 dated April 22 , 2008 . 
Critical themes in board deliberations

The Reserve Bank of India today advised banks to encourage large agricultural borrowers such as agricultural commodity processors , traders , millers , aggregators , etc . , to hedge their risks related to agricultural commodity prices . 
Banks provide a number of credit facilities to customers engaged in activities related to agriculture . 
Volatility in agricultural commodity prices may negatively impact such borrowers and the banks . 
Hence , hedging of agri - commodity price risk will be beneficial to both the borrowers and the banks . 
At present , a number of hedging tools , including derivatives , are available in the Indian market . 
However , these tools are not being used extensively due to lack of awareness of the products or due to perceived complexity of these products . 
The Reserve Bank has , therefore , advised banks to educate their customers about the suitability and appropriateness of using various hedging tools so that they can take an informed decision . 
This will also reduce the scope of mis - selling of derivatives . 
Banks have to keep the sophistication , understanding , scale of operation and requirements of their agri - borrowers in mind while advising them on the availability and use of these instruments . 
RBI proposes to introduce PPI for Mass Transit Systems ; seeks Comments on Draft Instructions
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website for comments and feedback the draft guidelines on Prepaid Payment Instruments ( PPI ) for Mass Transit System ( PPI - MTS ) . 
Comments may be e - mailed or sent by post to the Chief General Manager , Department of Payment and Settlement Systems , Reserve Bank of India , Central Office , 14th Floor , Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg , Mumbai - 400 001 on or before June 15 , 2015 . 
The Reserve Bank of India has been receiving requests from various segments , including providers of mass transit services , such as , metro train and road transport services , indicating the need for PPIs catering to the requirements of this segment to enhance commuter convenience . 
It was felt that a separate category of semi - closed PPI for mass transit systems which handle a large number of small value cash payments will facilitate the migration to electronic payments in line with the country’s vision of moving to a less - cash society . 
The PPI - MTS can be used within the mass transit systems and will have a minimum validity of six months from date of issue . 
Such PPIs will be reloadable instruments subject to an outstanding limit of ₹2 , 000 / - at any point of time .

In case of full subscription in the 14 - day term repo , there will be no 7 day term repo auction on the following Friday . 
Banks would be required to place their bids with the term repo rate that they are willing to pay to RBI for the tenor of the repo expressed in percentage terms up to two decimal places . 
Once the bidding time is over , all the bids would be arranged in descending order of the term repo rates quoted and the cut - off rate would be arrived at the rate corresponding to the notified amount of the auction . 
Successful bidders would be those who have placed their bids at or above the cut - off rate
All bids lower than the cut - off rate would be rejected . RBI will , however , reserve the right to ( i ) inject marginally higher amount than the notified amount due to rounding effects and ( ii ) inject less than the notified amount without assigning any reasons therefor . 
Need to make SLCCs More Active and Effective : RBI Governor
There is a need to make the State Level Coordination Committees ( SLCCs ) more active and effective even though the progress made by them was satisfactory in conduct of quarterly meetings
Gathering market intelligence through better coordination among various regulators and initiating quick follow up action was an important element in bringing to book , entities indulging in unauthorised and suspect businesses involving funds mobilisation from gullible public . 
Dr . Raghuram G . Rajan , Governor , Reserve Bank of India stated this in Mumbai today while inaugurating the Conference of the Chief Secretaries / Finance Secretaries and select Cooperation Secretaries of States . 
Shri U . K . Sinha , Chairman , Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) , Dr . Harsh Kumar Bhanwala , Chairman , NABARD also addressed the conference . 
Shri Harun R . Khan , Dr . Urjit R Patel and Shri S . S . Mundra , Deputy Governors , Comptroller General of Accounts ( CGA ) , senior officials of the Ministries of Finance and Corporate Affairs , NITI Aayog , the Reserve Bank and SEBI attended the conference . 
SLCCs have been recently reconstituted in each State to monitor unauthorised collection of deposits and they meet more frequently under the chairmanship of Chief Secretaries / Administrators of the concerned States / Union Territories ( UTs ) with participation of senior level officials of the States and the regulators . 
In his inaugural remarks , the Governor stated that while India’s macro economic parameters have improved , growth was still slow in picking up . 
Emphasising the importance of fiscal consolidation in terms of both , quantitative and qualitative dimensions , he added that the State Governments would have a critical role in improving the consolidated fiscal performance of the government sector as a whole . 
He highlighted the need for improvement in governance structure , capitalisation and resolution mechanism in the cooperative banking sector which plays a crucial role in credit flow to disadvantaged groups , especially in rural areas . 
He stated that without efficient governance , capital infusion would not benefit the sector , as it would function as a ‘leaky - bucket’ . 
He also emphasised the need for prompt corrective action and much stronger accountability in the co - operative banking sector . He suggested evolving of effective resolution mechanism , such as , the “good bank - bad bank” model in which good parts of the bank could be identified and segregated from the bad and the bad part could be dealt with appropriately . 
Earlier , while welcoming the participants , Shri Harun R . Khan , Deputy Governor , Reserve Bank of India highlighted the role played by this forum over the years in respect of improvements in the arrangement for borrowings by the State Governments , methodology for determining the ways and means advance to the States by the Reserve Bank of India , ceiling on guarantees issued by the State Governments , introduction of fiscal responsibility legislation by the States , etc . 
He sensitised the States about the challenges faced in resource raising given the increasing size of borrowings by the Central and State Governments , reduction in the SLR requirement and non - diversification of investor base . 
Despite these challenges , the weighted average spread of borrowings by the State Governments vis - à - vis the Central Government securities of corresponding maturity had come down to 38 bps last year as against 75 bps in the year before , he pointed out . 
He also referred to the implications of borrowings by the States following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission , in particular those relating to limiting of additional borrowing criterion to fiscal discipline for more capital expenditure and the carry forward of the unutilised borrowing limits to the following year . 
The Conference also discussed the roadmap of State Governments moving to the standard e - Receipt / Payment platform linked to the CBS ( e - Kuber ) of the Reserve Bank for safer and more efficient receipts and collections by all the State Governments over the next few months . 
Addressing the conference , Shri U . K . Sinha , Chairman , SEBI , informed the gathering about some recent amendments in the SEBI Act providing more clarity with regard to SEBI’s role in Collective Investment Schemes ( CISs ) . 
Now if a company not registered with any financial regulator collected an amount exceeding Rs . 100 crore can automatically be classified as CIS under the amended SEBI Act , he pointed out and added that SEBI had also been given power of recovery . 
After the inaugural session , the discussions were carried forward in a breakaway session chaired by Shri S . S Mundra , Deputy Governor . 
While addressing the group , Shri Mundra , highlighted the need to enact the Protection of Interest of Depositors’ ( PID ) Act in the States to ensure a tough legal environment for the fraudulent entities . 
He also emphasised the need to set up Economic Offences Wing and Cyber Cells in all the States / UTs for speedier action against the economic offences . 
The State governments were requested to periodically make available data on financial institutions falling under their regulatory purview . 
The data was required for a study to macro map shadow banking sector in India . 
In order to initiate the process of Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) monitoring exercise , the Reserve Bank was mandated to initiate a study to macro map shadow banking sector in India . 
In respect of the Urban Co - operative Banks ( UCBs ) , issues relating to appointment of professional directors on the boards of UCBs , delay in appointment of liquidators by Registrar of Cooperative Societies ( RCS ) in respect of UCBs whose licences were cancelled by the Reserve Bank , delay in supersession of board / appointment of Administrators when requisitioned by the Reserve Bank , connected lending , etc . , were highlighted by the participants . 
The issue of disqualification of a member of superseded board , the recommendation of Malegam Committee relating to setting up of Board of Management ( BoM ) in addition to Board of Directors ( BoD ) , representation of depositors on the boards and decline in the ‘cooperativeness’ of co - operative banks were also discussed . 
The Reserve Bank raised the issue of resolution of negative networth banks , appointment of statutory auditors and their rotation in the audit of UCBs and unauthorised functioning of unlicensed banks . 
The issue relating to re - capitalisation of short term co - operative structure and revival scheme for unlicensed District Central Cooperative Banks ( DCCBs ) were discussed . 
Some State Government officials raised the issue of introduction of crop insurance scheme for agricultural loans . 
Chief Secretaries / Administrators and Finance Secretaries shared their experience and made valuable suggestions in improving the co - ordination mechanism for sharing and acting on information on unauthorised deposit taking activities under different garbs .

RBI Clarification on FDI Inflows
It was recently reported in a section of the press that the amendment to Foreign Exchange Management Act ( FEMA ) , 1999 introduced to the Finance Act , 2015 will do away with the need for the Reserve Bank of India’s approval for foreign direct investments ( FDI ) in India . 
It is clarified that in terms of the Regulations framed under FEMA , 1999 , an Indian company receiving FDI does not require any prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India at any stage . 
It is only required to report the capital inflow and subsequently the issue of shares to the Reserve Bank in prescribed formats . 
It may be noted that , FDI in India can be made through two routes , namely , the automatic route , where no prior approval from any authority is needed for an Indian company to receive FDI and the approval route , where the company receiving FDI requires prior approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board ( FIPB ) . 
FDI under both the routes is subject to FDI policy and the conditions laid down in the relevant Regulations framed under FEMA .

RBI celebrates its 80th Anniversary
Opening remarks by Dr . Raghuram G . Rajan , Governor , Reserve Bank of India at the Financial Inclusion Conference , April 2 , 2015
The Reserve Bank was set up in 1935 when India was under British rule . But the RBI was certainly not a British institution , and has been working right from the outset for Indian economic interests . 
It has also nurtured Indian talent . In 1943 , Chintaman Dwarkanath Deshmukh , one of India’s finest financial minds , was appointed as the first Indian governor of the Reserve Bank . 
Amongst the problems he had to confront was how to deal respectfully but firmly with the debts the colonial power had accumulated to India during World War II . 
Over the years , the Reserve Bank has been blessed with a number of such great leaders , a reflection also of the importance the government places in having a strong central bank . 
The list of past governors and deputy governors reads like a who’s who of the Indian economic establishment , with governors like Benegal Rama Rau , M . Narasimham , Dr . I . G . Patel , Dr . Manmohan Singh , Dr . Rangarajan , Dr . Bimal Jalan , Dr . Y . V . Reddy , and Dr . Subba Rao , ably assisted by deputy governors such as SS Tarapore , Vepa Kamesan , Dr . Rakesh Mohan , K . Udeshi , Shyamala Gopinath , and Usha Thorat . 
The RBI’s board has also been superb , with people like Sir Purshottamdas Thakurdas and Yezdi Malegam guiding it . 
Interestingly , many of the governors were from the administrative services , with only one , M . Narasimham , from the RBI itself . Nevertheless , all understood that the Reserve Bank’s role is to safeguard the monetary and financial stability of the country even while working towards its financial development . 
There has always been a constructive dialogue between the Government and the Bank , informed by their respective time horizons and attitudes towards risk . 
And history records that successive governments have invariably appreciated the wisdom of the Reserve Bank’s counsel . 
Over the years , the Reserve Bank has addressed many concerns . 
Inflation control has been foremost – and the Reserve Bank has done an admirable job over time , despite the price pressures created by food shortages , oil prices and wars . 
Financial sector development has been another concern . 
The RBI’s role has included setting up new institutions , encouraging the use of technology , developing markets , and expanding financial inclusion . 
In the coming year , we will have many new players in the banking eco - system , such as payments banks , small finance banks and possibly a postal bank competing with existing universal banks , regional rural banks , cooperative banks , and a variety of non - bank finance companies . 
The use of technology has also expanded from the days when accounts were maintained manually in ledgers and unions called for strikes at the very mention of the word computers . 
Today , some banks allow customers to do all their banking transactions on a mobile phone , without entering a branch or touching a pen . 
The Reserve Bank ' s intent is to create an ownership neutral , institution neutral , technology agnostic level competitive arena . 
For example , technologies enabling touch - and - go payments will find use even as banks focus on acquiring and analysing information and reducing transactions costs as they compete to extend financial services to all . 
The RBI’s state - of - the - art payments system will support technology , even as the RBI strengthens its cyber - supervision and cyber - security . 
We also need deep markets to absorb risks that stay too often in banks or in corporations . 
Here too our track record has been strong . 
Though many developing country governments are forced to borrow only in foreign currency , the Reserve Bank has fostered a liquid rupee government bond market , where the government today is able to contemplate issuing 40 year bonds . 
The rupee is truly becoming international as foreign institutions queue up to issue rupee denominated bonds . 
New products supported by the RBI , such as the recently introduced interest rate futures contract , are doing a roaring business on exchanges . 
Our tasks are far from over . 
The nation has enormous financing needs in infrastructure , and far too many of our banks already have too much exposure . 
Big corporate infrastructure players have also taken too much debt . 
The required national push to finance infrastructure should not override financial stability , which is key to national security . 
Going forward , we need to develop new sources of risk capital so that our infrastructure needs can be financed with moderate amount of debt , even as we help the system deleverage . 
Perhaps the country’s most important financial challenge , which is the theme of the Conference today , is to bring financial services to every doorstep and to every small enterprise . 
The poor are still too far away from , or too uncomfortable stepping into , bank branches . 
With government initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana and the MUDRA Bank , as well as new technologies , new institutions , and new processes such as direct benefits transfers , I am confident that our country can empower the poor and the small with both choice and opportunities . 
Finally , if the Reserve Bank is respected today , it is because of the many thousands who have worked over the years for the Bank , with capability and dedication . 
Let me recognize two . 
Rani Durve , a DGM in the Bhopal office , has created numerous films , books , and street plays on themes such as fictitious emails and excessive interest rates so as to educate and inform the public . 
Nirmal Pattnayak , an AGM in the Department of Information Technology , enabled the pan - India electronic transfer of funds for government departments through the national electronic payment systems , thus overnight making the government one of the largest users of electronic payments . 
Both have gone beyond the ordinary call of duty , but they are only representative of many others in the Bank . 
The RBI is also respected for its integrity . 
It is a matter of great pride for me today that when someone enters our building to persuade us to change a regulation , they come armed not with money but with arguments about what is right . 
Let me conclude . 
Strong national institutions are hard to build . 
Therefore existing ones should be nurtured from the outside , and constantly rejuvenated from the inside , for there are precious few of them . 
In the 81st year of this great institution let us rededicate it to helping the nation secure prosperity and economic opportunity for all . Thank you for joining us in this celebration . 
Shri A . C . Mahajan , Chairman , BCSBI ; Shri M . Narendra , Chairman , Assocham National Council for Banking & Finance ; Shri Ashvin Parekh , MD APAS LLP ; other dignitaries on the dais ; colleagues from the banking fraternity ; members of Assocham ; representatives of the print and electronic media ; ladies and gentlemen ! 
Let me begin by complimenting ASSOCHAM for flagging an issue that is so relevant and contemporaneous for the banking industry . 
Banks face immense challenges in the area of management of loans and advances in view of the mounting non - performing assets . 
These challenges exist in spite of the normal rigors that are specified by the regulator and banks’ own Head and controlling offices . 
An increasing number of enabling statutes and enactments coupled with fair practice lending codes make the job of a lender extremely challenging and open to scrutiny . 
It is against this backdrop that the bankers - borrowers ‘love - hate’ relationships need to be analysed . 
It seems to be an imaginative idea on part of ASSOCHAM to invite the banking supervisor to inaugurate the session in a bid to arbitrate between the banker and borrower and invite the wrath of both ! 
On a more serious note , a determining aspect of the banker - borrower relationship is built on trust and understanding . 
It is also important that these relationships neither get too cosy nor do they get too strained as either would have deleterious consequences for the sector and the larger economy . 
The banking regulations in a way set the ground rules for bank - borrowers relationship , while the supervisory process ensures that this relationship remains healthy . 
Based on my own practical experience in the field - first as a commercial banker and now as the banking supervisor , I intend to highlight some of the behavioral practices that RBI expects from the bankers and the borrowers . 
I would also emphasize some regulatory / supervisory concerns that currently exist and could arise from unhealthy relationships between the two . 
Banker - borrower relationship : Built on foundation of trust and understanding
Relationships demand honest discharge of certain responsibilities by the parties concerned and that alone leads to development of mutual trust and respect . 
This is equally applicable to a banker - borrower relationship as well . 
A non - receptive banker or a truant borrower is a malady that the credit system can ill - afford . 
The banker - borrower relationship is essentially symbiotic as both need each other . 
Both have certain expectations from the other and when these don’t get fulfilled on account of a malafide or fraudulent intent on the part of either of them , the relationship gets strained . 
Recent spurt in instances of forensic audit being conducted by bankers on their borrowers signifies a breakdown in the implicit trust . 
There has also been an increase in incidence of suits filed against defaulters and cases of wilful default - an unwillingness to pay , despite an ability to pay . 
These problems could have their genesis in a failure to exercise the right amount of prudence and due diligence on part of the banker or an ab initio intent of the borrower to defraud the bank . 
This , however , is not a one - way street . 
The bankers have also been known to be indifferent and negligent of the genuine needs or problems of the borrowers in many cases . 
More often than not , it is due to a lack of basic understanding of the borrowers’ business . 
At times it is due to factors which are beyond the borrowers’ control . 
In fact , both extremes - excessive or too little trust and due diligence can prove detrimental to banking business . 
A middle course perhaps would be the most ideal mix with the bankers following the right regulatory rigor and the borrowers following a model code of conduct in their dealings . 
Having set out the broader realm of the banker - borrower relationship ; let me now turn to some specifics insofar as the expectations from bankers and the borrowers are concerned and non - observance of which can vitiate the relationship between the two . 
Expectations from bankers
Timely sanctioning and disbursal of the loans –
Borrowers approach the banks because they need finance . 
The business needs varying quantum of money at different stages . 
I do not need to go into the details but what is of essence is observing timeliness by the banks in sanctioning the loans and disbursing as per the needs of the borrower . 
The borrower would have his commitments to its creditors , suppliers etc . and if these are not met his projections can go haywire . 
This issue is of far greater significance in case of small borrowers like MSMEs . 
Unlike large corporate they do not have multiple sources of finance and they could quickly go out of business . 
The banks also need to provide handholding support to the borrowers , especially in times of stress .

Liquidity conditions eased in April 2015 after the tightness in the second half of March 2015 on account of advance tax outflows and financial year - end behaviour of banks . 
The Reserve Bank’s liquidity management operations were reversed in view of the improvement in liquidity conditions through April . 
During May , however , rapid increases in currency in circulation and a build - up of government balances resulted in liquidity conditions tightening again . 
Accordingly , fine tuning operations of varying tenors were conducted , besides the regular overnight repo at fixed rate and 14 - day variable rate repo auctions . 
These injections helped meet the frictional liquidity requirements . In May , the average daily net liquidity injected through LAF fixed rate repos , besides regular 14 - day variable rate repos , additional variable rate repos and MSF , was ₹1031 billion as compared with ₹819 billion in April . 
As a result , weighted average money market rates shadowed the policy rate . Longer term interest rates , particularly gilts , hardened in early May on international cues but eased in the second half of the month , particularly after the issuance of the new benchmark bond . 
Merchandise export growth has weakened steadily since July 2014 and entered into contraction from January 2015 through April , with a recent shrinking of even volumes exported . 
The deterioration in export performance affected economies across Asia as global demand fell and the fall in commodity prices impacted terms of trade for commodity exporters . 
From December 2014 onwards , merchandise import growth also turned negative , led by a sharp decline in the volume of oil imports as inventory build - up by refineries subsided . 
Gold imports spiked in the month of March and remained elevated in April owing to festival demand and regulatory relaxations . 
Notably , the volume of imports has been recording increases , despite the value decline . 
Given these developments , the reduction in the current account deficit resulting from the sharp decline in oil prices has begun to reverse , though the size of the deficit is expected to be contained to about 1 . 5 per cent of GDP this year . 
Net exports are , therefore , unlikely to contribute as much to growth going forward as they did in the past financial year . 
Consequently growth will depend more on a strengthening of domestic final demand . 
While portfolio and direct foreign investment flows were buoyant during 2014 - 15 , with net foreign direct investment to India at US $ 36 . 6 billion and net portfolio inflows at US $ 41 billion , the year 2015 - 16 has begun with net portfolio outflows in the wake of a reduction in global portfolio allocations to India . 
Foreign exchange reserves are around US $ 350 billion , providing a strong second line of defence to good macroeconomic policies if external markets turn significantly volatile . 
Policy Stance and Rationale
Banks have started passing through some of the past rate cuts into their lending rates , headline inflation has evolved along the projected path , the impact of unseasonal rains has been moderate so far , administered price increases remain muted , and the timing of normalisation of US monetary policy seems to have been pushed back . 
With low domestic capacity utilization , still mixed indicators of recovery , and subdued investment and credit growth , there is a case for a cut in the policy rate today . 
Yet , of the risks to inflation identified in April , three still cloud the picture . 
First , some forecasters , notably the IMD , predict a below - normal southwest monsoon . 
Astute food management is needed to mitigate possible inflationary effects . 
Second , crude prices have been firming amidst considerable volatility , and geo - political risks are ever present . 
Third , volatility in the external environment could impact inflation . 
Therefore , a conservative strategy would be to wait , especially for more certainty on both the monsoon outturn as well as the effects of government responses if it turns out to be weak . 
With still weak investment and the need to reduce supply constraints over the medium term to stay on the proposed disinflationary path ( to 4 per cent in early 2018 ) , however , a more appropriate stance is to front - load a rate cut today and then wait for data that clarify uncertainty . 
Meanwhile banks should pass through the sequence of rate cuts into lending rates . 
Assuming reasonable food management , inflation is expected to be pulled down by base effects till August but to start rising thereafter to about 6 . 0 per cent by January 2016 – slightly higher than the projections in April . 
Putting more weight on the IMD’s monsoon projections than the more optimistic projections of private forecasters as well as accounting for the possible inflationary effects of the increases in the service tax rate to 14 per cent , the risks to the central trajectory are tilted to the upside . 
Reflecting the balance of risks and the downward revision to GVA estimates for 2014 - 15 , the projection for output growth for 2015 - 16 has been marked down from 7 . 8 per cent in April to 7 . 6 per cent with a downward bias to reflect the uncertainties surrounding these various risks
Furthermore , monetary easing can only create the enabling conditions for a fuller government policy thrust that hinges around a step up in public investment in several areas that can also crowd in private investment . 
This will be important to relieve supply constraints and aid disinflation over the medium term . 
A targeted infusion of bank capital into scheduled public sector commercial banks , especially those that implement concerted strategies to clean up stressed assets , is also warranted so that adequate credit flows to the productive sectors as investment picks up . 
The third bi - monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on August 4 , 2015 .

Caution against Fictitious Mails - 1
It has come to the notice of the Reserve Bank of India that an app ( application ) is doing rounds on WhatsApp purportedly to facilitate checking of balance in customers ' bank accounts . 
The application has an RBI logo with the title ' All Bank Balance Enquiry No ' and has listed several banks with either a mobile number or call centre number . 
The Reserve Bank wishes to clarify that it has not developed any such application . 
Members of public are , therefore , advised to use the application , if at all , at their own risk . 
The Reserve Bank of India has cautioned the public against Multi - level Marketing ( MLM ) activities so that investors do not fall prey to unscrupulous entities . 
Explaining the functioning of these entities , the Reserve Bank stated that MLM / Chain Marketing / Pyramid Structure schemes promise easy or quick money upon enrolment of members . 
Income under such schemes majorly comes from enrolling more and more members from whom hefty subscription fees are taken rather than from the sale of products they offer . 
It is incumbent upon all members to enroll more members , as a portion of the subscription amounts so collected is distributed among the members at the top of the pyramid . 
Any break in the chain leads to the collapse of the pyramid , and the members lower down in the pyramid are the ones that are affected the most . 
The Reserve Bank has advised that members of public should not to be tempted by promises of high returns offered by entities running Multi - level Marketing / Chain Marketing / Pyramid Structure Schemes . 
The Reserve Bank has reiterated that falling prey to such offers can result in direct financial losses and they , in their own interest , should refrain from responding to such offers in any manner . 
The Reserve Bank has also said that acceptance of money under Money Circulation / Multi - level Marketing / Pyramid structures is a cognizable offence under the Prize Chit and Money Circulation ( Banning ) Act 1978 . 
Members of public coming across such offers should immediately lodge a complaint with the State Police . 
The Reserve Bank of India today issued one more alert to the public about the newest form of fraud perpetrated in its name - a credit card issued by fraudsters in the name of the Reserve Bank . 
Explaining the modus operandi , the Reserve Bank stated that the gullible member of the public is sent a credit card which allows withdrawal of money up to a certain limit , albeit a small sum , from a bank account . 
Having gained the confidence of the victim thus , the fraudster gets him to deposit a huge sum of money in the same bank account . 
Once the money is deposited , the card stops working and that would also be the last time the holder of the card ( victim ) would hear from the fraudster . 
Warning against such efforts , the Reserve Bank has reiterated that as India’s central bank , it does not carry out any business with an individual , whether through savings bank account , current bank account , credit card , debit card , online banking services or receiving and holding funds in foreign exchange or any other form of banking services . 
The Reserve Bank has listed out the other kind of prevalent frauds , such as : 
Fictitious offers of large sum of money / lottery winnings by email or through phone calls by posing as RBI official . 
Fake Reserve Bank website for online transactions

The Reserve Bank has once again cautioned members of public that falling prey to such offers can result in compromising one’s own crucial personal information that may be misused to cause direct financial and other loss to them . 
They , in their own interest , should refrain from responding to such offers in any manner . 
Rather , they should immediately lodge a complaint with Cyber Crime branch of the Police , the contact details of which are available in the Reserve Bank’s press release issued earlier ( Complain to Local Police / Cyber Crime Authorities against Fictitious Offers of Money from Abroad ) . 
It has come to the notice of the Reserve Bank of India today that a fake website has been created at http : / / www . rbi - inonline . org / savings . html by some unknown persons offering various banking facilities and asking members of public to apply on - line for opening “RBI Savings Account” . 
The Reserve Bank clarifies that as India’s central bank , the Reserve Bank of India does not offer services offered by commercial banks , such as , savings bank account , current bank account or credit cards . 
As such , the question of the Reserve Bank offering online banking services , as is indicated on the fake site , does not arise . 
The Reserve Bank has cautioned members of public not to fall prey to spurious offers made by the fake website . 
The Reserve Bank has further cautioned members of public that applying on line on that website could result in compromising one’s own crucial personal information that may be misused to cause financial and other loss to them .

The Reserve Bank cautions members of public that it has not developed any such software ; nor has it sent any such mail asking online banking customers to update their account details to secure their online accounts . 
In fact , the Reserve Bank does not have any mail id with extension @ rbi . com
Members of public receiving such mails should not open the attachment and / or try to download the attachment on their computers .

The offers are purportedly signed by top executives / senior officials of such authorities . 
While the names of the officials might be correct but their signatures are fake . 
The offer document would contain contact details of a so - called RBI officer working in some department in the Reserve Bank / public authorities . 
The fraudsters initially ask potential victims to deposit small sums of money for reasons , such as , processing fees / transaction fees / tax clearance charges / conversion charges , clearing fees , etc . 
The victims are asked to deposit the money in a specified account in a bank . 
The fraudsters often have multiple accounts in the names of individuals or proprietary concerns in different bank branches for collecting such charges . 
Genuine but gullible account holders are persuaded by the fraudsters to even lend their accounts for such fraudulent activities on the promise of receiving some commission . 
Once the initial amount is deposited , demands for more money follow with more official sounding reasons . 
After accumulating a sizeable amount in these accounts , the fraudsters withdraw or transfer the money abroad and vanish leaving the victims in a lurch .

Here is an attempt to answer some of the Frequently Asked Questions on Indian Currency . 
Some Basics
Coins : Coins in India are presently being issued in denominations of 50 paise , one rupee , two rupees , five rupees and ten rupees .

Coins in the denomination of 1 paise , 2 paise , 3 paise , 5 paise , 10 paise , 20 paise and 25 paise have been withdrawn from circulation with effect from June 30 , 2011 and are , therefore , no more legal tender . 
Currency : Banknotes in India are currently being issued in the denomination of ` 10 , ` 20 , ` 50 , ` 100 ` 500 , and ` 1000 . 
These notes are called banknotes as they are issued by the Reserve Bank of India ( Reserve Bank ) . 
The printing of notes in the denominations of ` 1 , ` 2 and ` 5 has been discontinued as these denominations have been coinised . 
However , such banknotes issued earlier can still be found in circulation and these banknotes continue to be legal tender . 
What is the Indian currency called ?

The accurate back to back registration makes the numeral appear as one when viewed against light . 
Water Mark and electrotype watermark : 
The banknotes contain the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi in the watermark window with a light and shade effect and multi - directional lines . 
An electrotype mark showing the denominational numeral 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 500 and 1000 respectively in each denomination banknote also appear in the watermark widow and these can be viewed better when the banknote is held against light .

How can one distinguish the MG series - 2005 banknotes ? 
In addition to the security features listed above , the MG series - 2005 banknotes have the year of printing on the reverse of the banknotes which is not present in the pre - 2005 series . 
What is the need for printing different series of banknotes ? 
Central banks the world over change the design of their banknotes and introduce new security features primarily to make counterfeiting difficult and to stay ahead of counterfeiters . 
India also follows the same policy . 
Current Issues
Why are ` 1 , ` 2 , ` 5 banknotes not being printed ? 
Even though volume - wise , the share of such small denomination banknotes in the total banknotes in circulation was high , in value terms they constituted a very small percentage with average life of less than one year . 
The cost of printing and servicing these banknotes being not commensurate with their life , printing of these banknotes was discontinued and these denominations were coinised . 
However , ` 5 banknotes were re - introduced in 2001 to bridge the gap between demand and supply of coins in this denomination . 
The printing of ` 5 banknotes has been discontinued from the year 2005 . 
Has Reserve Bank of India considered producing a plastic banknote ? 
The Reserve Bank , in consultation with Government of India , has decided to introduce one billion pieces of ` 10 banknotes on plastic substrate on trial basis . 
What is a " star series " banknote ? 
Fresh banknotes issued by Reserve Bank of India till August 2006 were serially numbered . 
Each of these banknote bears a distinctive serial number along with a prefix consisting of numerals and letter / s . 
The banknotes are issued in packets containing 100 pieces . 
The Bank has also adopted the " STAR series " numbering system for replacement of defectively printed banknotes . 
The Star series banknotes are exactly similar to the existing Mahatma Gandhi Series banknotes , but have an additional character viz . , a * ( star ) in the number panel in the space between the prefix and the number as indicated below : 
What is non - sequential numbering ? 
With a view to enhancing operational efficiency and cost effectiveness in banknote printing , non - sequential numbering was introduced in 2011 consistent with international best practices . 
Packets of banknotes in non - sequential number will have 100 notes which are not sequentially numbered . 
What is on a banknote to help visually challenged people identify the different denominations ? 
Each denomination is a different size ; the greater the value the larger the note . 
So a ` 1000 note is larger than a ` 10 note and so on . 
There is an identification mark on the left hand side of each note on the front side which is in raised print ( intaglio ) and has different shapes for different denominations for eg . Diamond for ` 1000 , circle for ` 500 , triangle for ` 100 , square for ` 50 , rectangle for ` 20 and none for ` 10 . 
Further , the denomination numerals are prominently displayed in the central area of the notes in raised print . 
Counterfeits / Forgeries
What is a forged note ? 
A suspected forged note , counterfeit note or fake note is any note which does not possess the characteristics of genuine Indian currency notes . 
How to check whether a note is genuine or not ? 
A forged note can be identified on the basis of the features which are present in a genuine Indian currency note . 
These features are easily identifiable by seeing , touching and tilting the note . 
It is advisable not to rely on just one security feature as no counterfeit note can normally be expected to successfully copy all of the security features included in notes . 
To read about how to check banknotes see the ( link ) http : / / www . rbi . org . in / scripts / ic _ banknotes . aspx
What are the legal provisions relating to printing and circulation of forged banknotes ? 
Counterfeiting banknotes / using as genuine , forged or counterfeit banknotes / possession of forged or counterfeit banknote / making or possessing instruments or materials for forging or counterfeiting banknotes making or using documents resembling banknotes are offences under Sections 489A to 489E of the Indian Penal Code and are punishable in the Courts of Law by fine or imprisonment ranging from seven years to life imprisonment or both , depending on the offence . 
Does possession of a forged note attract the punishment of fine or imprisonment ? 
Mere possession of a forged note does not attract punishment . 
Possession of a forged note knowing to be such and intending to use the same as genuine or that it may be used as genuine , is punishable under Section 489C of Indian Penal Code , 1860
What are the actions taken by the Reserve Bank of India to train general public to distinguish genuine banknotes from forged notes ? 
The Reserve Bank of India has been organizing training sessions on the authentication of banknotes security features for people handling significant amounts of cash like banks / consumer forums / merchant associations / educational institutions / police professionals . 
Apart from the training sessions , information on security features of banknotes is also available on the Bank’s website . 
Why has RBI decided to withdraw pre - 2005 series banknotes ? 
Reserve Bank of India decided to withdraw from circulation all banknotes issued prior to 2005 as they have fewer security features as compared to banknotes printed after 2005 . 
It is a standard international practice to withdraw old series notes . 
The RBI has already been withdrawing these banknotes in a routine manner through banks . 
It is estimated that the volume of such banknotes ( pre - 2005 ) in circulation is not significant enough to impact the general public in a large way and the members of public may exchange the pre - 2005 series banknotes at bank branches at their convenience . 
Clean Note Policy : 
Reserve Bank of India has been continuously making efforts to make good quality banknotes available to the members of public . 
To help RBI and banking system , the members of public are requested to ensure the following : 
Not to staple the banknotes
Not to write / put rubber stamp or any other mark on the banknotes
Not to use banknotes for making garlands / toys , decorating pandals and places of worship or for showering on personalities in social events , etc .

Sales Tax
Sales Tax in India is that form of tax which is imposed by the government on sale / purchase of a particular commodity within the country . 
It is imposed under Central Government ( Central Sales Tax ) and the State Government ( Sales Tax ) Legislation . 
Normally , each state has its own sales tax act and levies the tax at various rates . 
Under the sales tax which is an indirect form of tax , it is the responsibility of seller of the commodity to collect or recover the tax from the purchaser . 
Generally , the sale of imported items as well as sale by way of export is not included in the range of commodities that require payment of sales tax . 
Moreover , luxury items ( such as cosmetics ) are levied higher sales tax rates . 
The Central Sales Tax ( CST ) Act that comes under the direction of Central Government takes into consideration all the interstate sales of commodities . 
Who Pays Sales Tax In India ? 
Sales Tax is recovered from the buyers / consumers as a part of the consideration for the sale of goods . 
However , for the purpose of CST , the actual payment of the Sales Tax is made by every dealer on the goods sold by him in the course of inter - state trade or commerce .

Selecting Distribution Channel

Case Studies
Case studies are very effective tools of sales literature , especially for service businesses that don ' t have a tangible product to demonstrate to prospects . 
A case study is a history of how a product or service helped a customer in some way . 
Case studies are also very specific ; they tell readers who had a problem and how your product or service helped to resolve that problem . 
Since case studies hold reader interest , they are often more effective promotional pieces than brochures and other types of sales literature .

Consumer market directed – Sales promotions directed towards the consumer .

Thinking of Starting a Business
Most of us have dreamt of Owning a business - at one time or another . 
And some of us have wondered whether Entrepreneurship would be appropriate for them . 
smallB . in will take you through a series of steps to convert your Ideas and thoughts to viable business propositions . 
A series of questions will help you examine your personal objectives and whether entrepreneurship is appropriate for you . 
You will also discover the process of Identifying Business Opportunities all around . 
We will help you get Inspired with a specially designed section on ' Some of the Most Successful Start - ups ' will . 
In addition , we present ' The Big List of Business Ideas ' for you to chew on . 
Why Consider Entrepreneurship ? 
Is Entrepreneurship Appropriate For You ? 
How to Identify Business Opportunities ? 
Get Inspired By Successful Startups
Franchise Opportunities
Putting Your Own Ideas to Work
The freedom to pursue your own ideas and intuition is a major advantage . 
You can spend your time and energy focusing on developing your own ideas and converting them into a successful business model . 
You Are Your Own Boss
You make the decisions , you decide who to work with and decide what work to do . 
There may be instances where you don’t agree with the corporate culture of a firm , or how they conduct business . 
Here you get to choose how you will run the business , what corporate culture to instill . 
Google , at the start up stage had a simple motto - “Don’t Be Evil” . 
They are known to have a corporate culture which is far different to the prevalent corporate culture . 
By starting their own company , the founders had a chance to infuse culture and business practices they believed in and you can do the same when you start your own company . 
Choosing the Location
Choosing a business location will be your own decision . 
You may choose to operate close to your market , or you may choose to operate close to home . 
The decision is entirely yours . 
Large Earning Potential
By starting your own business , you will be the owner and own most of the equity . 
If your business is successful , you have the potential to earn a lot more . 
Some people may view their jobs having no career growth or financial growth prospects . 
If you feel the same way , then maybe it is time for you to consider starting your own business . 
However , the downside is that there is no guaranteed pay check , but then again , there is no guarantee for your job security as an employee . 
Choose Your Working Hours
More than anything , this offers flexibility in working hours rather than working less . 
Most successful start - ups are the result of long hours and hard work . 
But the upside here is that you get to choose when to go on vacation , when to work and so forth . 
Just as long as you get the required work done , there is no stopping the flexibility . 
Get Involved in the Operations of Your Business
Since the start - up is your idea , your business , you are free to involve yourself in any aspect of running the business . 
This is best illustrated by an example . 
Steve Jobs , the co - founder of Apple Inc . , involved himself in every step of the business , right from idea generation to design , manufacturing , marketing and the in - store experience . 
He was able to devote himself entirely to his business and as a result his products and company are one of the best in the world . 
Seeing your business grow from ground up can be very satisfying and fulfilling . 
Make Your Business a Family Asset
Many of us want to leave behind a sense of financial security for our family . 
For example , since you will own most of the equity in the company , you can pass it down to further generations so that they have a sense of security . 
Maybe your children can take over running the business from you when you are ready to retire . 
Family businesses can also provide employment to other members of the family . 
What Do You Love Doing ? 
Or Love Doing In Your Job ? 
Consider your passions and what you enjoy doing . 
Many success stories have come from the fact that people pursued their passions and dreams . 
Think about this - would you be happy working 40 + hours a week on a job that you don’t like or would you rather spend those hours working on something you love doing . 
Are You Excited About Your Idea ? 
Enthusiasm will be extremely important to the success of your idea . 
After all , if you do not get excited or generate enthusiasm by thinking of starting your own business or your idea , then how will it be different to your current job ? 
Your enthusiasm will make others sit up and take notice of your idea / business . 
Is Different Enough ? 
Many people are under the illusion that there are no new ideas out there . 
While that is not true , you have to consider the fact that very few businesses are 100 % different from others . 
What you need is an idea that Target Segment cares for and is willing to pay for it . 
Look at the Ford Company for example . Cars were being manufactured before , so making cars was not a revolutionary idea . 
They modified the manufacturing process and reaped huge benefits . 
The lesson here is - Improving upon an existing business model could be a great strategy . 
Would it Pain You if You Never Pursued the Idea ? 
Regretting not following up on your business idea can be as painful as the fear of failure . 
While this doesn’t mean that you should pursue every single idea you have , give yourself a chance to succeed with the one that you truly care about . 
Is it Worth Giving Something Else Up ? 
This is a very subjective question . 
Each person will look at it differently . 
Sacrifices may include giving up the perks that come with a corporate job . 
Since you will have to invest a lot of time in your start - up , this may mean that you would have to sacrifice spending time with family , friends . 
Starting your own business may also mean that you will have to live on a tightened budget for a while . 
You need to look at the potential sacrifices you will have to make . 
If the list is too long , or you cannot cope with the sacrifices then it may be that you are not ready for entrepreneurship just as yet . 
What Have Your Life Experiences Been ? 
Your past experiences will help determine if you should consider entrepreneurship . 
If you are unhappy with your current job , or face limited career prospects , then you should consider becoming an entrepreneur . 
How Strong is the Feedback ? 
Feedback is essential to the development of your idea from just a thought to a full - fledged business . 
Try to see how people react when you present your idea to them . 
Receiving feedback from discussions with people may mean that your idea has interested them . 
Developing your idea is an on - going process and if your idea is garnering interest then you are on the right track . 
How to Identify Business Opportunities ? 
Identify Market Inefficiencies
When looking at a market , consider what inefficiencies are present in the market . 
Do you have an idea on how to correct these inefficiencies ? 
Consider the example of FedEx or Agency FAQs . 
FedEx identified inefficiencies in the package delivery market and strived to correct this inefficiency by providing fast and reliable delivery of packages . 
This spawned the creation of the courier industry as we know it today . 
Similarly , Agency FAQs saw that there was an unmet need in the market . 
There was no information portal for professionals working in the advertising sector . 
They aimed to fill that gap and now they are one of the largest websites in that segment . 
Remove Key Hassles
Take a look at some of the key hassles customers face when buying or using a product or a service . 
You don’t necessarily have to have a new product or service
You can be innovative and improve a product , a service or a business process . . 
Purchasing processes in some products categories are still a major source of irritation for customers . 
Think how you can improve and provide a superior alternative . 
For example , look at how the search engine market developed . 
There were millions of websites on the Internet and it was often very hard for customers to find what they were looking for .
